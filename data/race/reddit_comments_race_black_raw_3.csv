""These black boys are just a bunch of violent apes. We need to get rid of 'em before someone gets hurt.""

""How you reckon we oughta do that?""

""*Beat 'em up and hang 'em to death.*"""
1,fthxwq6,"Are you serious?  There are myriad reasons for that disparity, let's start with slavery. Horrible work prospects, unfair treatment in a country full of racist morons, abhorrent social programs put into place by Democrats to incentivize not being a productive member of society.  Disruption of the family unit, that's a big one. Black boys are often without a positive male role model due to the prison system's hunger for non-violent drug offenders.  

ALL of that is true, but the people ripping off the band aid and digging around in the wounds of the past can fuck off.  Making every single thing that happens to a black person *racist* is, in and of itself, *racist*.  Further dividing Americans, keeping us stupid and angry for all the wrong reasons.  Useful idiots like you, so desperate to feel superior to someone you start seeing Nazis behind every shadow."
2,ftjrkwl,"“It sounds grammatically correct on the surface, but these don’t exist separately.  All/Blue Lives Matter was a counter to the secondary statements that people disagreed with in BLM.  No one disagrees with any of the phrases on their own, obviously - of course black/blue/all lives matter.  It isn’t clear that any these phrases really help provide clarity or solutions anyway. “
&gt; Slogans are exactly that - a tagline to help solidify the cause. Makes for good chanting. It’s a rallying cry. Do you think “MAGA” is really helpful? No it’s a slogan. 

“The BLM slogan was born from sentiment rather than evidentiary circumstances and made worse with misleading information.  “
&gt; it is an emotionally charged slogan derived from the conclusions drawn from statistical and video evidence. 

“The other ones are almost glib slogans that are just as obvious as BLM and are a form of trolling IMO. “
&gt; re: the definition of trolling - being an ass to get a reaction; without purpose other than entertainment

“People pick up on that and see it as insincere on its own, which is fair.  No one liked the idea of innocent cops being killed before this, so there was never a need to get people on board with that.”
&gt; the reason why “blue lives” were not ‘protested’ for: their are laws that are properly enforced in the case of a cop dying. Why is there no protest for “example white person who was killed by a black guy”? Those pictures of the black guy are mugshots. He was already arrested. Which is proper. 

“There’s no evidence supporting the idea of systematic racism with policing.  They simply look at the outcomes and see black people incarcerated at a higher rate today and assume this is because there is something racist going on - blacks were slaves for hundreds of years outside of Africa and hosed down in the street as recently as the 1960’s, so why not think this?  Unfortunately, black people commit crimes at higher rates so it’s no wonder that they will be disproportionately prevalent in the prison system. “
&gt; crimes are defined by the system. The system is flawed. Take cocaine. The Crack form is in general, more common in black populations. Powder cocaine is more common in white populations. (Wolf of wall street anyone?). The minimum sentence for possession of a given amount of crack is 100 times the amount of powder cocaine. Also, go back 70 years - the crime of being black in a whites only school. Yeah, sure, it’s the ‘law’, but it’s a fucked up law intended to target black people. “Oh those don’t exist anymore” look at the war on drugs. 
&gt; the process to detain and prosecute black suspects is notably more violent than most white suspects. And before you say it - no, it’s not because the suspect is more violent. Compare Breonna Taylor who was /asleep/ to school shooter who will not be named who was given a damn hamburger after his arrest. 

“Studies show that increased criminality isn’t due to laws “tricking the helpless black people into breaking the white man’s rules”, but rather there is a much stronger correlation with family structure and income inequality (the latter of the two often stems from the first).  It’s mostly men in prison, so we’ll focus on boys.  Boys that grow up without a father are far more likely to end up in prison.  Black people have the highest rate of single motherhood, and having one parent typically means one source of income and less likely to have a proper division of labor in the home from 2 adults.  If you forget about race and only look at people based on their upbringing and the resources they had, you can more accurately predict criminality as opposed to just looking at race. “
&gt; and /why/ are black people statistically more likely to be poor in America? Does it have to do with redlining, preventing black families from building generational equity in housing? Does it have to do with the school to prison pipeline that, yes, young black boys are funneled into? Does that maybe have something to do with the cyclical and *cough* systematic structures that keep black generations poorer, more prone to criminal activity, and target of risk profiling?

“This is a behavioral issue rather than a systemic obstacle that’s unavoidable for certain skin tones.  Black immigrants are more likely to have two parents, are far less likely to end up in prison, and do fairly well in the US, and asians actually do better than white people on average - I don’t remember the founding fathers being racist asians.  It’s no surprise then that asians have even lower single motherhood rates than white people and are incarcerated less.”
&gt; holy shit talk about using racial stereotypes. My dude, ever hear of the “model minority” ya want to know why that’s a problematic statement? Use google. Jesus. 

“It also doesn’t help that these sentiments/discussions sometimes mix police officers and undesirable trial outcomes together in it, despite the fact that they exist in separate branches of the government.  That creates more for them to prove their case, and weakens the argument further because it isn’t clear which system they’re protesting.  Is it just police activity (Executive branch), trials (Judicial branch), or all government in general?”
&gt; the man who murdered George Floyd acted as Judge, Jury, and Executioner. He accused him of a crime, arrested him, and murdered him, and felt justified because he was a ‘criminal’. 
THE ENTIRE PROBLEM WITH POLICE BRUTALITY IS YOUR EXACT ARGUMENT. Yes, those are different branches of the judiciary system. And the police acting as such is a problem. The commanders who do not punish them are a problem. A judicial system that refuses to prosecute is a problem. They are /protesting the entire system/, because the System, and all the people who defend and uphold it, are responsible for this fucked up shit."
3,fv25w17,"First off no one said she killed the baby. But she ATTEMPTED to kill the child

https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/07/16/mpls-day-care-provider-gets-probation-hanging-baby

People get longer sentences for weed. Attempted murder on a child especially should carry out a longer sentence

https://people.com/crime/mom-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-for-using-friends-address-to-enroll-son-in-school/

Wouldn't the fact that the mother is HOMELESS be taken into consideration of why she sold drugs. Did she get a mental health evaluation to ensure if she was coping with being a single mother who happens to be homeless?  And she hasn't proven to be violent yet a woman who literally hung a baby gets a lesser sentence because she proved ""low risk""


Even white kids shooting up schools is because of their ""mental health"" and the bullying they endured. Yet black boys are called ""thugs"" they never take into consideration what led them into commiting the crime.



Yeah and American courts saying a person is low risk and might not offend again have been proven wrong. They literally let a serial killer out on the loose

4,fv8npln,"I know the issue firsthand. I haven't dismissed shit. I said that melanin is not the cause of these issues as the media likes to paint out. We are all human, so something must happen from our birth to adolescence that puts us into certain directions. My view is that class and social psychology are far more pertinent. 

By the way you're projecting a bit. I'm a black guy from a working class neighbourhood in South London. Anyway...

“In 2015 a national study found the north-east of England to have the highest rate of knife crime in England and Wales, and in 2017 many of the most horrendous knife crimes, such as the stabbing to death of a two-year-old and a seven-year-old and the murder and dumping in the woods of a sixteen-year-old girl, did not happen in London and were not committed by black teenagers. Glasgow was dubbed the Chicago of Britain as long ago as the 1920s because of its notoriously violent gangs,3 and while teenage stabbings seem to have been drastically reduced in the city, the violence of organised crime is still a very serious issue facing Glaswegians.4

So while violence of the organised-crime and teenage-gang varieties has been with us for some time and continues to affect regions of the country where very few black people live at all, if you live in London and read the London press, you’d be forgiven for thinking that a) black boys are the only demographic that have ever been affected by this issue and b) London is one of the most violent cities in the world”

“Even in London, when you adjust for class, the ‘ethnic model’ of explaining street crime falls away entirely. It’s also important to note that while London feels incredibly dangerous for teenagers it remains, in reality, a far safer city than media hysteria would have you believe, and the vast majority of murders in the city are committed by adults, not teenagers. ”

Excerpt From: Akala. “Natives: Race and Class in the Ruins of Empire - The Sunday Times Bestseller”."
5,fw41aqf,"&gt; The reason black men are killed at disproportionate rates isn’t because cops are all overtly racist KKK members who wanna kill black folk (though there are quite a few). It’s actually due to covert racism.

No, the reason is because there is more violent crime committed by African Americans as a percentage of their population vs white Americans.

&gt;In the case of Rice, it’s most likely things like assuming he was older than he was (black boys are usually seen as older &amp; less innocent) and most likely the **cops assuming that because a black male had a gun it must be for criminal intent** &amp; therefore justifies an immediate shooting, despite Cleveland, Ohio being a concealed carry area.

...a reasonable assumption given that the police reports literally said he was pointing it at people.

All these anti-police arguments fall apart quickly when you look at the facts."
6,ftipx3w,"You know during this whole social media support for the protests, I also posted things on my social media about black women who were murdered by police. And although whatever police reform will mostly benefit bm cause they are the main targets, as long as bw also benefit at least somewhat, I will support these protests from the comfort of my own home. But I’ve been trying to find stats of how many more black women are dying completely preventable deaths through childbirth cause doctors are racist and how many more black women are getting murdered by their male partners of whatever race and it seems that the latter group is overwhelmingly more numerous than bw who were murdered by racist police (I support death penalty for every officer who killed a bw tho). But bw are already at a huge disadvantage in terms of all recourses, financial and emotional, and I worry that they are trying to fight bm’s fights that ultimately will not benefit them in any major way until Blm includes all these bw-specific issues like black maternal mortality... obviously I wouldn’t say something like that on my sm cause I’m white and I’m not gonna tell bw how to do their anti racist movement but if I were a black woman, no way I would have put my life at risk in a huge crowd of violent males for a fight that will mostly benefit bm in the middle of a pandemic. I don’t remember the exact number rn but if 400 bw die completely preventable deaths from childbirth per year cause racism and then 40 bw are murdered by police each year cause racism, I would focus on the maternal mortality part. Fucking abduction and sex trafficking rates of black girls are astronomical compared to white girls and I just don’t see these bw-specific issues being raised in blm, at least not in my info bubble. And ww are of course also guilty of racism against bw, and I support ww getting fired for saying racist things about bw, in fact if a ww asks to touch a bw’s hair, she should be fucking fired immediately, but ultimately ww don’t murder and rape bw, it’s men of all races who are doing that."
7,fw485jb,"Background checks are already done in most states to prevent convicted violent criminals from owning firearms.  This covers wifebeaters.  

As for red flags that label people unfit...realize that young black boys are the most MISdiagnosed for ADHD than any other race.  Red flag laws would likely target and strip minority groups of their gun rights more than others.  The other issue is that it will be impossible to successfully screen everyone...some will slip through and when that happens there will be stricter and stricter restrictions.

In a perfect world we catch every person who means harm and not flag anyone who wouldn't....but this isn't Minority Report...not even close."

9,fvrphat,"Btw the way.... some of your claims are a bit ridiculous. 

+ Rape, Sexual Assault, Genital mutilation and domestic violence are very violent crimes that can results in serious consequences. And the large portion of victims are black women across the world. Or course there are male victims, but it’s extremely ignorant to ignore that it is more likely to happen to women. In many developing countries young black girls are being married off, sold as sex slaves and labor slaves in the Middle East and other places. It’s disgusting. Police brutality, especially what black men like George Floyd go through is horrific, but if we keep in it real what I just listed above occurs on a normal basis. With many of it being based on sexist beliefs like girls shouldn’t enjoy sex but only reproduce..... so they cut parts of their genitals off. I’m not even going into detail on some African cultures customs and rules that are still in place. And with losing child.... giving birth is extremely painful and then on top of that black women and their children risk losing their lives. 

I would highly recommend you to actually read up on the issues Black women grapple with. Get out of your ego and masculinity. Learning the struggles of lgbtq doesn’t negate the issues I go through as a heterosexual Black woman, and it shouldn’t with you. 

And recommending you to do so isn’t an agenda. 

At this point I actually think your a troll given the point your gaslighting and arguing for Black women to prove their struggles in a Black woman’s space, and you most likely aren’t one.

So this is my last response to you."
10,fwgc6uz,"Poor people kill poor people. Race is not the best guide to violence, but poverty is. For example, if you have an area that is mostly black, you couldn't say if it was violent or not, but if you have an area that is poor you can.

We, as a society, judge black people to be more guilty than white people, and we judge men also to be more guilty. What I mean by this is that for the same crime, black boys are more likely to be charged as an adult and found guilty for every offence, the opposite is true for white girls.

I don't know if you remember the kids for cash scandal where a judge was paid by a private prison to find more people guilty, surprise surprise, he locked up mostly black boys.

Then we've got to talk about what are police actually for? Do you want lower crime in general? Then criminalising black boys is not the way to go about it. Most of the prison population is there for drugs, and most of them are black, even though in the States black and white people take the same amount of drugs. That is because they are over represented in the amount of stop and searches, and because we judge them harsher. This puts these non violent criminals in with violent criminals, creating future criminals. Exactly what happened with the kids for cash scandal (there was a movie that somehow didn't even mention the fact that most of the kids were black boys)

You can't separate parts of the Justice system. It all comes together to criminalise black boys"
11,fwmejm7,"Firstly I'm very sceptical why you chose to bring this up now in today's climate especially but I digress.  Why would there be results on Korean websites it's not offending them.  Do you think anti Asian racism is a hot topic in Africa? Humans are tribal by nature.  And secondly it was racist, I was offended.  She played into stereotypes of black people that are based on historically negative perceptions, that black girls are violent/ agressive and 'wanna go'.  Wendy, as a Canadian, who literally had a black girl singing backup for her   High school performance of a Beyonce song should and hopefully now knows better.  I love red velvet, I love Wendy's voice and think she is a nice person but her immitations were  racist and offensive."
12,fxap5o4,"Well fuck that comment. Poor people kill poor people. Race isn't a deciding factor in crime, poverty is. For example, if you look at a black household, or area (fuck segregation), you couldn't say whether it could be violent or not, but you would have a much better chance if you are looking at people by poverty rate.

This sort of stupid statistic that ignores every factor outside of race is exactly the problem. All you are doing is binding yourself to the societal causes that we can actually do something about. We can work at poverty alleviation, then you could say that it is because they're black, but until then all you're saying is that you haven't even tried.

Statistics don't tell the whole story. The aryan brotherhood are just 1% of the prison population but commit 30% of the violent crime. Is that because they are white, or because they are on the bottom ""rank"" of prison society (like black people not in prison)?

You could go even further if you wanted to. What about the fact that we judge black people to be more guilty than white people, and men more guilty than women? What I mean by that is for the same offences white women receive the shortest sentences and black men the longest. Also, black boys are the most likely to be charged as adults.

Or what about the kids for cash scandal where a judge was paid by private prisons to find more people guilty and when the documentary about that came out it failed to mention he targeted black boys. Or what about the fact the most prisoners are black men arrested for non violent drug offences? Black people and white people in America take the same amount of drugs but black people get stopped, searched, arrested, and charged at much higher rates. Then prisons can be so tough that you have to join a gang to survive. We criminalise them.

When is it time to question our systems instead of blaming the blacks? It's clear if you look at the statistics that American ""justice"" criminalises the youth. For example the countries with the best prisons have the lowest reoffending rates. That doesn't work with the logic of American crime and punishment.

I hope you take the time to read this comment, and I wish you the best"
13,fwz23pt,"I ... don’t think the way I’m hurting is particularly relevant to anyone involved. My dad is “black” (African/Italian/German/Chinese) and my mom is “white” (British/Scottish/Native Canadian/Dutch). Making everything about being black or white period makes me uncomfortable. Being told to support “black” owned business...Im sorry WHAT owned? “Black” and “White” aren’t cultures, histories, religions, or races. They are variations of skin tone that only have significance because one group of people declared themselves “white” (therefore better) and everyone ELSE to be expendable. Using these terms denies us our histories and allows people on both sides to say I’m neither black nor white enough to claim myself as part of them. I don’t want to shop “black owned” this week and “Asian owned” next week and “whatever race white hegemony deems acceptable” the week after that. I want people in authority to stop blocking access to people of colour. The American  world is the same now as it was when Alexandre Dumas moved to France because, to paraphrase “I wanted to write books about adventure. I didn’t want to write books about being black.” 

So I have shelves full of books about being black but no books written by black people about being. I have a Netflix queue peppered with quirky Indian girls and Asian families who constantly have to remind me how Indian or Asian they are, and pages of wishlisted movies with Asian and Indian writers and directors that make it clear that these are entire cultural heritages and no, they don’t spend all day just laughing at how Indian they are.

Likewise the black side of my family never sat around the table trying to entertain me with how black our family was. They didn’t go on about chicken and grits and greens and wash it all down with kool aid and then stand on somebody’s porch making yo momma jokes. At least not any more than all the other kids in my class. 

I don’t play basketball, I can’t skip double Dutch, I’m not a good singer or dancer, and I’m painfully aware that most opportunity for people who look like me is in those industries. Every single store I shop at (as a fashion influencer and stylist, because modelling was another one of those few industries I was allowed to join as long as I could basically bifurcate myself) ...anyway every store I shop at is posting signage standing with BLM and yet, when I was in college and looking for work they didn’t hire me. They’d hire black girls or white girls. Asian looking girls could always find work at pan-Asian restaurants. Euro girls could find jobs at boutiques, especially if they spoke French. But there’s no place for anyone who isn’t really anything. 

I’m a huge advocate for police and government reform. Police brutality is disgusting and needs to end especially against minorities. 

I feel like white male hegemony is a big group encompassing a lot of people in authority: government officials, police officers, and so on. And I’m constantly being asked to split my allegiance. This month is for LGBTQ, except when it’s not because now it’s for BLM, they need the help more. I’m not allowed to say LGBTQ people are subjected to more violent hate crimes than the black community. I’m not allowed to say 4 times more women are killed by partner violence than all people killed by police, 20% of whom are black, so several times more women are killed by intimate partner violence than “black” (Haitian? Caribbean? Freedom Seeker?) are killed by police. I’m not allowed to say it because we are ONLY talking about black people right now and caring about something else will steal the limelight. 

Only it’s not something else. Young black girls are disproportionately effected by intimate partner violence, by kidnapping and forced prostitution. Young ethnic women (as we’ve seen in Canada this week) are too often victimized by police and other authorities, including the medical community. 

I cannot in good conscience choose to only support the cause of the week. I have been to numerous fundraisers where every second person asked if I was my dad’s girlfriend, or if I was adopted because  I’m not “black” by their standard. I’ve been to events where I was told “white peoples don’t support us, why should we support them” when I tried to discuss other causes affecting women in our communities. 

Increasingly I feel like you’re just supposed to choose a side based on your superficial looks, and say all the “right” things and never think about the fact that supporting one cause doesn’t take away from another cause...both causes support each other in that they are both for the promotion of human rights. 

As long as we keep thinking of ourselves as the ONLY minority group getting treated poorly, we miss most of the causes for that poor treatment. We fight amongst ourselves, judging who is and is not “allowed” in the inner circle, without asking ourselves who controls the narrative, who we are asking for permission, who STILL owns the inner circle.

TL;DR We need more intersectional advocacy that considers all the factors affecting people. The idea that one cause takes away from another is based on an idea that we’re asking someone for permission, finances, and protection....because they have more of all three. Who is the target market for the message, then?"

15,frjxoty,"a lot of my thoughts have already been covered in this thread more eloquently than i could have hoped to express them, so i'm just going to say that--imo--her name-dropping was racially insensitive. i'm not outright calling her a racist, nor saying that's where her mind was when she made the post, but this whole 'why isn't there a space in feminism for delicate, white &amp; submissive lil old me'?? tone deaf. 

traditionally, when woc (specifically black) artists aren't being viewed as angry &amp; violent, they're being hyper-sexualised; they haven't had the privilege of being able to be 'delicate' in the same way white women have. hell, even young black girls are viewed as maturing faster than white girls. women like megan thee stallion reclaim the authority over their sexuality through more 'sexual' concepts ('real hot girl shit'/the whole 'hot girl' persona) &amp; it's the same w the other artists she mentioned (minus doja i dont fw her anymore lmao). i guess that might feel alienating for lana because these types of concepts are becoming rapidly more popular and seen as markers of progressive feminism, and her feelings are valid totally, but she needs to understand the privilege she has in being able to be seen as 'delicate and submissive'.

there has ALWAYS been space for delicate white women in feminism. ALWAYS. and every female in the industry faces heavy, heavy criticism. does she think people don't 'slate' the artists she mentioned in her post? i just think it was kinda... entitled of her? idk. just some of my thoughts."
16,fryzjf7,"Well you are right about mass shootings mostly white kids, sex offerders on the other hand is mixed and there are horrifying stats of how many underage black girls are raped in their community, violent crime is mostly blacks but serial killers mostly white so ya I would say all races have fucked up people but still we always have to talk about race not just fucked up people. Racism will come from all sides white to black, black to white, Asian to black all do some form of racism, it will never end because it sells, media love racism it gets them clicks."
17,ft0olb0,"While I'm not one of the mods, your comments in r/baseball were quite racist and I'll explain why I say this.

Firstly, racism doesn't mean ""hating people of a different skin color than yours"", it is an intersection of power and privilege linked to one's race. Your attitude in that thread, referencing your fiancée is a ""person of color"", the fact that you felt the need to use quotes around the phrase ""person of color""- a technique used to dismiss the term or phrase being used as invalid, calling that phrase out as racist, you read as very belittling, and your use of statistics makes me (an Epidemiologist) cringe. You are very dismissive and are of the experiences of BIPOC when speaking on the topic of police brutality and/or harassment, claiming you know better because you throw around statistics.

Normally I am all for statistics, but statistics do not tell the entire story in this case and they fail to take into consideration other social factors. One factor is socioeconomic status- you see greater police presence in neighborhoods with high rates of poverty, blacks are more likely to be of lower income and living under the poverty level than whites, and these areas also tend to be areas with higher population densities. In short you have a large population in a small geographic area, that in and of itself is enough to skew your statistics regarding rates of crime and the demographics of those who commit them. It's simple confirmation bias. 

The most frequently employed distraction away from issues of racial mistreatment by the justice system is that ""most crimes against blacks are committed by blacks"", the old ""black on black victimization is the real issue"". In most crimes, especially violent crimes, the perpetrator is more likely to be someone known to the victim than they are to be strangers. If you live in a predominately black neighborhood, attend a predominately black school, interact with people who are predominately black at church or in your neighborhood, then basic rules of probability dictate you are more likely to be the victim of a crime committed by someone who is black because that's the majority population in that area. 

Statistics from crimes do not tell the whole story. For example, [black girls are viewed differently than white girls](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/poverty-inequality-center/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2017/08/girlhood-interrupted.pdf) (PDF), [black boys are viewed as older than white boys](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/03/black-boys-older), including by [white adults who work with children](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201696). This is institutional racism that has nothing to do with crime rates or other behaviors, this is how people view innocent children. And you can see this only increases with age, look [how we talk about college athletes](https://www.voanews.com/usa/study-examines-racial-bias-us-sports-reporting) and [in football reporting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03343.pdf). 

The United States was built on institutional racism and it's never gone away, just changed how it's implemented."
18,fqmm96m,"I agree that black children are socially seen as less childlike and it’s harmful. But also keep in mind that black kids aren’t necessarily seen as “having agency”. They’re seen as *animalistic*. They are punished more because they are viewed as less intelligent, more violent, less *human*. Which yes, does result in attributing agency to them in cases where it wouldn’t be to a white child, but no one is thinking about it from the perspective of “black boys are just so responsible”. And indeed, this is in fact a tool to *rob* black youth of their actual agency through state violence against them and incarceration.

A similar thing actually happens to women and girls around sexual violence. They are attributed agency *over the actions of of their rapist*, having “tempted” or “seduced” their attacker through their clothes, flirting, drinking, something to that effect. They are portrayed as to have caused the attack upon themselves. And again, this is another fiction where women are attributed agency *to maintain the status quo that actually robs them of agency*. After all, every method by which women are told they can/should prevent sexual violence against themselves amounts to little more than an enforcement of gender roles and gendered segregation (after all, what did you expect being alone with a man you aren’t related to?) and that women maintain traditional “ladylike” behaviors.

I wouldn’t call either of these experiences really “having too much agency” so much as I would call them “victim blaming” or “justifications for oppression” or something to that effect."
19,fs6ll4w,"Relevant Gary Younge quote (it's actually about Trayvon Martin but it's eerily prescient):

&gt; Appeals for calm in the wake of such a verdict raise the question of what calm there can possibly be in a place where such a verdict is possible. Parents of black boys are not likely to feel calm. Partners of black men are not likely to feel calm. Children with black fathers are not likely to feel calm. Those who now fear violent social disorder must ask themselves whose interests are served by a violent social order in which young black men can be thus slain and discarded."
20,fss5lqv,"It’s hard to separate anything on crime from race even if we just point to culture we have to recognize Black American culture was built on racism. 


But I would like to try and answer this question on why Blacks commit more crime than Whites the best I can. 



1.  Let’s be honest the judicial system has a racial bias. White people are less likely to be stopped. Less likely to be convicted and less likely to face charges. Even less likely to get better lawyers. From the get go any statistics we have will be biased. Of course Blacks will commit more crimes if their neighborhoods or more heavily policed and they are more likely to be convicted.

2. Now even beyond the criminal justice system we should look at Black culture. It also affects why there’s more Black violence in America. 

 2A. Childhood exposure to violence 

Now we both know that there’s more Black criminal violence than criminal white violence. Violence usually creates more violence. When exposure to violence as a child is considered white boys and black boys are just as likely to commit violence when they grow up. However, since black boys are more likely to witness violence they are more likely to perpetuate that violence late on in life. 

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00181-016-1160-y


2B lack of Fathers in the Black community. Again this ties back to my first point in which Black men are more likely to go to jail for the same crime. Black areas are policed more than white areas. Meaning a lot of Black fathers are not at home but in prison/jail. 

But beyond the criminal justice system 

They are more likely to be unemployed (which again ties back to the criminal justice system) consider White ex-felons are more likely to be hired than Black ex-felons. 

https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/244756.pdf


The biggest reason for why Black people commit more crime is because of family disruption. 

When Black men are more likely to be locked up for non-violent crimes. Their children are more likely to commit violent crimes. You add to this Black out of wedlock births. Institutional poverty within the Black community. The wealth gap between Blacks and Whites. Amount of single parent mothers. All of this adds up to black people committing more crime. But none of these issues can be separated from institutional racism because it’s all connected."
21,fmwp9v7,"Its not racist to note that ‘Most of the victims are black, as are their killers'. Equally its not racist to note that a lot of black boys are in gangs. Or that there is a high amount of violent crime in the black community. What do you think the reason for that is? Genuinely I'd be interested in reading your views. 


Why do you. Why are nearly half of Black Boys in Hackney fatherless? Is there a link between this and the high amount of violent crime in the black community. Is black culture, and the concept of family in black culture less respected. 

I heard the economic and poverty related arguments. And I've heard the point about racial discrimination in the workplace. But a lot of other communities deal with racism and poverty too. But they don't have the same levels of violent crime. ."
22,flhxj2m,"&gt;certain conservative and traditionalist muslim lobbies have successfully brandished woke identity politics to cast for liberal audiences their defences of violent and abusive practices

The types that use liberal idpol are the Ilhan Omar types. ""Traditionalist"" muslims hate woke idpol, for example, in America, guys like Daniel Haqiqatjou


&gt;None of that has pre-empted me from Muslim pussy.

How many have you fucked? Where they practicing Muslims?

If your cock is  so good as to get devout Muslim girls to use you for sex, I am going to have to ask you to post hog


&gt; But Muslims in particular and society in general would be far improved if Muslims on a mass scale adopted attitudes towards sex more commensurate with, say, Latinas in California.

Most girls, including most Muslim girls, don't want to be sluts tho. They want to get married and only have sex with their husbands.

Of course, a growing minority of them are learning to love cock, but I doubt, if they still take Islam seriously, they would be not at all cool with people like you telling them their religion is dumb or evil or whatever. I mean, I would love to have a devout Muslim wife to suck and fuck bwc's with, but we are not going to let people insult Islam without consequences (in minecraft).

And the majority of converts to Islam, according to several studies, seem to be latinas, interestingly enough. One thing I like about Latin American culture is that its acceptable for girls to slut it up, but atheism is still extremely taboo.

 So we are probably going to have both the attitudes towards sex and atheism that Latinas have anyway.


&gt;They can be religious and have their identity but they also don't have to wrap up their toddlers in hijab and can maybe not do genital mutilation?

the khimar (""hijab"") is only expected of girls once they get into adolescence. Parents like dressing up their little kids in hijab because its cute, not because they have to, and is only done on special occasions.

FGM also has nothing to do with Islam and is only a regional cultural practice. Unless you are talking about penis circumcision, which is mandated by Islam, and is largely non-controversial in the West besides MRA types


&gt;Do you like Black girls?

Absolutely, they are hot. Only problem is that black girls are butterfeet. Brown girls have prettier feet."

No systematic injustice? So you mean 60 years after POC couldn’t use the same facilities as white people or live in the same neighborhoods everything is just peachy? And mass incarceration, definitely not systematic injustice, people going away for non-violent drug crimes longer than murderers and rapists. And the school to prison pipeline? No unfairness here when 5 year black girls are going to jail in handcuffs for “having a tantrum”. I don’t see any systematic injustice here.

Cool, you’ve lived with a dirt floor. My uncle had a dirt floor house when he went to school, we’re not that far away from that.

27,fbh0xbw,"&gt;Graveley says he believes Chrystul’s crime was premeditated. The evidence, he argues, shows she planned to murder Volar so she could steal his BMW.

Yes, I'm sure that was her motive - she wanted a BMW.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Miriam Falk, a veteran sex crimes prosecutor in Wisconsin, said those charges typically lead to a substantial cash bail, upward of $100,000 if the person involved is wealthy. Add in video evidence and the case would be a “dream” for prosecutors. “That would be a very difficult case to defend,” Falk said.  
&gt;  
&gt;**But on the same day police arrested Volar, they released him. Records indicate he paid no bail but was told he would be summoned to court.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The court summons never came.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Volar spent $20,000 to hire a criminal defense attorney, but three months passed before police sent the case to the district attorney’s office. The file showed what was found in Volar’s house: “hundreds” of child pornography videos, **featuring girls who appear to be as young as 12**, and more than 20 “home videos” of Volar with underage black girls.  
&gt;  
&gt;Still, Volar was not taken into custody. No sex crimes case was entered into the Wisconsin court system.

Jesus, you don't even have to pay when you're rich and white.  You just have to be rich and white.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;After Volar was killed, homicide detectives quickly learned more about his activities. On the day of his death, police received a call from TCF Bank, where most of Volar’s money — $800,000 in assets — was housed. Prosecutors would later say that Volar’s funds came from legal trading in cryptocurrency. The bank, police reports show, suspected something else was going on.  
&gt;  
&gt;A bank official called the police to flag that between November 2017 and May 2018, Volar had almost $1.5 million in transfers — in a pattern of activity the bank associated with human trafficking.

So, Chrystul's actions, while questionable, forced the Police to uncover his activities and may have saved others.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Rachel Monaco-Wilcox, who runs a legal clinic for human-trafficking victims in Wisconsin, said police and prosecutors who are unfamiliar with these issues regularly fail to recognize that under federal law, there is no such thing as a “child prostitute.” Children, especially children of color, are still seen as willing participants in the sale of sex, and research shows black girls are routinely perceived as older and more sexually mature than their white peers.  
&gt;  
&gt;“\[Investigators\] think, ‘My 14-year-old daughter would never do that, so there’s no excuse,’ ” Monaco-Wilcox said. “ ‘They knew what they were doing. They put themselves out there.’ ”

I just can't get into the mind of someone who is supposed to be imparting justice, yet justifies a 16 year old girl being a willing participant.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Only after multiple interviews with The Post did Chrystul describe, quietly, what that meant. Volar, she said, sold her through Backpage.com to other people. She said he would post ads, then drive her to hotels in Milwaukee, where men his age or older would spend 30 minutes with her. She gave Volar the money she earned. Sometimes, she said, Volar would arrange for her to meet more than one man in a day.

Volar was a monster.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But other child-trafficking victims involved in violent crimes are still behind bars. Some have been there for decades. For many, the abuse they experienced was never brought up in court, or it was dismissed as irrelevant, making it impossible to know the number of cases that exist across the country.

And I wonder how many of their wealthy offenders are still walking free

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For a year and a half she’d \[Chrystul's mother\] been going over it all in her head. Why hadn’t she stopped Chrystul from going to live with her boyfriend? Why hadn’t she asked more questions about those new clothes? She reminded herself that she had three other kids, worked long hours and moved to Milwaukee to survive. Only sometimes did it make her feel any better.

Because when you work a shit job, and every day is a struggle to make ends meet for you and your four kids and you come home at the end of the day and you're tired as shit, it's hard to find the will and the energy for even the most important things in our lives.

&gt;That evening, for the first time, Taylor started to go through the box. Beneath drawings and coloring books, she found a leather-bound Bible. Inside was a list titled, “My goals.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Finish school,” Chrystul had written. “Gain 20 to 25 pounds.” “Get out and do better!!”

Earlier in the article it mentioned that Chrystul loved to play the violin.  There were also pictures of her as a sweet little baby.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“The court,” Wilk announced, “is satisfied that a blanket affirmative defense to all acts leads to an absurd result.”  
&gt;  
&gt;He decided: Chrystul did not have access to the affirmative defense law for trafficking victims. In his view, neither would other trafficking victims charged with violent crimes.

So, the law that allows defense for sex trafficking victims was a hard pass for Chrystul.

Are all violent deaths of young black males because of racism? No. You would never make that silly, stupid argument. But that is what these trans black boys are. Black males. Its black males killing other black males in disenfranchised areas. Treat the problem for what it is, not what you WANT it to be.

30,f5ym35y,"It all plays a role. Crime rates certainly do increase with poverty, social exclusion, and a lack of education. With that being said, the rates of murder in black communities has been nearly 10x that of white communities at every income level for decades and far exceeds what these factors can explain. 

The largest predictor of violent crime is the family structure. Young boys are much more sensitive to adverse childhood conditions, and are especially sensitive to a lack of male role models. 

More than 70% of white kids, about 59% of hispanic kids, and only about 33% of black kids live with both parents. Affluent black men, from families making 400k or more a year, have the same marriage rates as white men from families making 18k a year

Secondly, we need for the legal system to stop using psychiatry as its underground, 
unofficial  arm.  If  there  are  no  public  agreements  on  norms  about 
behavior,  no  one  can  be  held  accountable  for  their  actions,  which 
is  how  the  current  system  of  psychiatry  exists.  Psychiatrists  judge 
behaviors and either rule them acceptable or unacceptable based on 
their  not  widely  circulated  diagnostic  manual,  condemning  people 
via diagnoses but not really holding them accountable because their 
behavior  is  then  described  as  a  disease.  We  need  to  officially  enact 
laws pertaining to what behavior is unacceptable, which is the third 
part  of  the  solution.  
These  laws  could  then  be  enforced  by  police 
officers  instead  of  giving  police  officers  unrestrained  administrative 
discretion  to  take  people  to  hospitals,  eliminating  the  acting  out  of 
bias against already marginalized groups such as African Americans 
and Latino Americans. Fourthly, we need to make these laws known. 
Legal education cannot be limited to lawyers if positive change is to 
occur. 
Conclusion and Opportunities for Further Research
The misguided attempt of psychiatry and 
first responders to predict 
future harm, the disregard for the allegedly mentally ill’s right to due 
process of law, and the subjectivity of psychiatry point to the necessity 
of  abolishing  the  practice  of  incarceration  for  supposedly  medical 
reasons. In order to end stigma at the structural level, that is, in courts, 
and  at  the  level  of  day-to-day  interactions,  a  revolution  in  thought 
must take place at the individual level and we must compassionately 
empathize  with  the  allegedly  mentally  ill  [7].  Sympathy  leads  to 
the   medicalization
&amp;
and   further   entrenchment
&amp;
of   oppression; 
empathy  is  needed  to  lead  us  out.  Future  research  could  investigate 
the use of counseling to de-escalate situations when police are called 
to deal with someone who is purportedly mentally ill. Non-coercive 
assertive community treatment could be examined as the alternative 
to involuntary hospitalization. Finally, there has been research about 
the  positive  effect  descriptive  representation  has  on  minority  racial 
groups,  but  there  could  be  further  research  done  into  the  effects  of 
descriptive representation for the allegedly mentally ill.

Similar to groups traditionally thought of as marginalized, such as ethnic groups, non-binary people, and 
women, purportedly mentally ill people are subjected to structural oppression. Despite being more likely 
to be victims of violence than perpetrators, we tend to think of mental patients as violent deviants, similar 
to the way black boys are consistently misidentified as being older and overall in possession of superhuman 
or  subhuman  traits.  Already  marginalized  groups  are  disproportionately  marginalized  further  by  mental 
health care stigma and predatory insurance-seeking by health care providers. The administrative discretion 
psychiatric and law enforcement professionals are given to deal with mental patients or people suspected 
of having mental problems is effectively a license to incarcerate anyone at any time with no due process 
and no uniformly applied repercussions in place to deter abuses of power, and people incarcerated by 
law enforcement officials often cannot afford an attorney. The result is a sometimes-predatory system in 
which predatory professionals mask their coercive collection of people’s insurance money by saying they 
are helping. Both the language we use—“cuckoo,” “not all there,” etc.--to talk about mental illness and the 
current structure of mental health care contribute to this further marginalization of the already marginal.
Stigma in Mental Health
How many times have you called--or heard someone called--“crazy?” 
It is so commonplace it often becomes disconnected 
from the actual group it references. 
This population group, the purportedly mentally ill, 
consistently referenced in day-to-day life more than any other population 
group, is currently subject to involuntary hospitalization, at any point, 
without a trial. A citizen needs only to call emergency workers and all 
but nominal rights are stripped away 
from the allegedly mentally ill person. In addition to lack of sufficient judicial oversight in the way people are involuntarily hospitalized, the facts of who is involuntarily 
hospitalized point to a systemic bias against already marginalized 
groups; mental patients are overwhelmingly poor, unemployed, and 
on welfare, and nonwhite males are more likely to be involuntarily 
hospitalized than white males [1][2]. City governments go too far in 
giving police and emergency responders unrestrained administrative 
discretion to break into a home without a warrant to take a purportedly 
mentally ill person against their will to a hospital under the pretext of 
potential harm. When such lack of restraint of the power to involuntarily 
commit someone is coupled with bias against people who have been 
previously hospitalized, socio-economic status, and race, then a 
potentially dangerous situation becomes a grave one.
Law Enforcement Officers' Administrative Discretion
There are strong similarities between the problem of militarized police 
departments and the treatment of the allegedly mentally ill. Much like 
the problem of the militarization of the police, as seen in the rise of 
“overwhelming paramilitary force,” mild domestic disturbances have 
the potential to result in mandatory hospital stays of at least a few days 
when police are involved [3]. As an article covering police reactions to 
protesters at the 2009 G-20 summit said, “note that no one needed to 
have broken actual laws to get arrested. 
The potential to break a law was 
more than enough. 
That standard was essentially a license for the police 
to arrest anyone, anywhere in the city, at any time, for any reason” [3](p. 
12-13). For purportedly mentally ill people this describes their day-to-
day life. Hospitalization can happen to anyone, anywhere, at any time, 
without any physical evidence of a reason. Neither 
first responders nor 
diagnoses can predict future acts of violence. 
Therefore, we cannot rely on 
psychiatric evaluations as the basis for incarcerating people.
Due Process
In addition to militarized police, unfairly withholding due process of law 
has also served as a mechanism of discrimination against purportedly 
mentally ill people. “Due process” is meant to protect against unfair 
proceedings involving restrictions of liberty in criminal courts, yet due 
process is virtually ignored in mental health courts. 
The growing body of 
mental health court documents is not available to the public, as releasing 
those documents would violate doctor patient con
fidentiality, among 
other rights; however, in a Utah district court case called A.E. and R.R. 
v. Mitchell, the court found no right-to-refuse treatment to exist [13]. In 
criminal court proceedings, defendants are jailed prior to their court date 
only they are a risk to themselves or to others. Otherwise, defendants are 
free to go until their court date. Courts are only involved in involuntary 
hospitalizations when a hospital decides to petition a judge for 
involuntary commitment after the mandatory “observation period.” In 
California the observation period is 72 hours and can last weeks in other 
states. During this observation period hospitals collect insurance money 
with impunity, under no obligation to let the allegedly mentally ill person 
leave. Incidentally, this incentive of insurance money has gone as far as to 
lead hospitals to hire bounty hunters to round up people to 
fill hospital 
beds [4]."
37,ewvhsqn,"Abstract: 

Similar to groups traditionally thought of as marginalized, such as ethnic groups, non-binary people, and women, purportedly mentally ill people are subjected to structural oppression. Despite being more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators, we tend to think of mental patients as violent deviants, similar to the way black boys are consistently misidentified as being older and overall in possession of superhuman or subhuman traits. Already marginalized groups are disproportionately marginalized further by mental health care stigma and predatory insurance-seeking by health care providers. The administrative discretion psychiatric and law enforcement professionals are given to deal with mental patients or people suspected of having mental problems is effectively a license to incarcerate anyone at any time with no due process and no uniformly applied repercussions in place to deter abuses of power, and people incarcerated by law enforcement officials often cannot afford an attorney. The result is a sometimes-predatory system in which predatory professionals mask their coercive collection of people’s insurance money by saying they are helping. Both the language we use—“cuckoo,” “not all there,” etc.--to talk about mental illness and the current structure of mental health care contribute to this further marginalization of the already marginal."
38,ey60yg7,"Okay then yes I agree with you. Nobody has made a call for genocide since WWII. So violent activism is clearly counterproductive.

If you really wanna feel like a SJW you can actually do some research about the quiet eugenics operating in the U.S, U.K and South America today. Because the corporations and governments are the racist entities responsible for the defunding of public education, funding of private prison industrial complexes, funding of gentrification, defunding of public heathcare, funding of Planned Parenthood and abortion practices while ignoring the statistical fact that black women have the highest miscarriage rates in the Western world, and black boys are statistically the most misdiagnosed for Special Ed and placed on pharmaceuticals. Also that the urban areas in our country are hyperparamilitarized and black men are still serving felony sentences for weed which is now corporately legal, on a state basis, not a federal one, so that weed companies can efficiently thrive in areas with a decreased black demographic.

THEN you can take your manufactured rage to your own country, which is founded and maintained by Freemasonic oppression and cohercing 3rd worlders with violence into mining Caltan and other conflict minerals to expand their military technological superiority, all for it to trickle down into paramilitary operations emulating China until you're wondering why you live in a police state with drone surveillance and facial-recognition algorithms collecting data on every significant move you take.

Sure I agree with you. When somebody explicitly calls for the genocide of a race, we'll take em down. So far that hasn't happened."
39,evc91x7,"&gt; Do you guys not have laws against that...?

No. We have several extremely poor populations that have been so for generations, and they have commensurate problems with drugs and violent crime. Uncaring parents, high recidivism rates, gang activity, municipal apathy, etc. Keep in mind that there are more people in the urban area in and around New York City than there are in the whole of Australia. There are problems that arise that you don't really think you need when population levels get higher, especially when population density increases and wealth decreases.

Juvenile offenses are handled by the juvenile courts. Punishment ranges from parental fines to detention in a juvenile facility to becoming a ward of the state (in very extreme cases). Most juvenile records are (or are eligible to be) expunged after the child reaches adulthood.

&gt; Like, do they get tried as an adult?

It's unusual. It usually requires a judicial waiver, but in some states it's prosecutorial discretion. It usually requires that the defendant be an older minor (16+) though some states have lower ages (14+ or lower). Further, it often requires that the child has already attempted juvenile rehabilitation in the past. It also typically requires a serious or extreme crime, usually violent (murder, rape, etc.). Some states have it set so that for certain crimes (murder or rape) children over the age limit will default to adult court. Juvenile courts are not always equipped to handle major crimes, and trial rights for the defendant are arguably more favorable in adult court (some defense attorneys have requested trial in adult court for this reason, in spite of the risk of higher penalties).

The original idea, AFAIK, was basically that if -- for example -- a child was 16 when they committed a crime, will be 17 by the time the trial is complete, and they're facing a 6 year sentence, then it doesn't make sense for the juvenile system to deal with them. It's better to get them involved in the adult rehabilitation system already because they're going to be necessary. Further, juvenile facilities aren't necessarily set up to handle extremely violent children, and the other children in these programs need to be protected from these violent offenders.

However, regardless of the crime, a minor convicted of a crime can not be sentenced to execution. [That one had to go to the SCotUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roper_v._Simmons). It should be noted that this didn't really come up that often, and it was mainly possible because most states didn't have any law around it.

Of course, black boys are more likely to be charged as adults than any other race committing a similar crime. As if Trump weren't a clear enough signal, racism ain't dead yet."
40,evdhpv1,"Kinda like how disaffected black boys are a distinct problem/demographic.

13% of the population, 50% of violent crime."
41,evf27qh,"Maybe, but disaffected black boys are a much more prolific and distinct problem/demographic when it comes to homicide/violent crime, which also might help explain why I read so many stories of ""teens"" committing violent crime in my areas of DC and Baltimore only to learn the criminals are 18 or 19-year-old black boys, it's, as you suggest, a way to let us know the demographic that is the problem.  Thanks for posting the argument, it works well for all demographics I think, as long as we apply it objectively and without bias."
42,ewmjl1y,"Agreed. It’s a good conversation to have! It can’t be “oh white boys have mental health issues, they need help, but black boys are naturally evil/violent”."
43,erob0vs,"My friend, there’s no 100%. And if we’re going to play statistical bingo, you could’ve found a far better example than “men are seen as angry or violent,” as the vast majority of violent crimes are committed by men. This is exactly the point I’m making - there is a TON of grey area. When we see statistics, and when we quote statistics, we should be saying “why?”. This is what I meant when I said we need to take context into account, because men’s rights advocates love to provide lists with none of it, supposedly proving why they’re so discriminated against.

As far as your “you could just as easily claim” goes, I’m happy you brought that up, actually. I’d encourage you to do some reading on the topic, as black boys are much more likely to be tried as adults than white, not because of the perception that whites are weaker, necessarily, but because black kids are seen over and over as tougher and stronger, which in this instance doesn’t work out well for them. If you’re to take away the racism from any time a police officer shoots a black kid, take away relative proportions of violent crime, you’re still left with an overage of black kids, who in a white cop’s mind, look like adults, are “intimidating”, “threatening,” and processed accordingly. We could also talk about the “black men all have giant dicks” trope. If you don’t apply context, it sounds like a compliment, until you put yourself in someone else’s shoes, look at the history of this trope, and realize it’s born of a dehumanizing story where black men were seen as only good for breeding more slave children. Doesn’t seem like a compliment now, right? That’s racism at work - so I thank you for bringing it up."
44,erg152k,"It's kind of a widespread US attitude in my experience, that there's nothing significant outside the USA, that it's the centre of the world and mist advanced place to live etc, so it makes sense that some African American people will have that attitude about being black, that African American culture is the main African/black culture in the world. That's how some people act, whether white or black ir anything else. 

My ex husband was from the US and had siblings who were African American and had small degree of African ancestry. But they were predominantly white, that would make up the biggest part of their genealogy, but they reject being white and only identify as being black people. It's understandable if people treat you differently because of your appearance, to identify as black only. But to hear some of them carrying on about what was done to THEIR PEOPLE and racial issues... I couldn't help thinking... but.. you... you're like 80% white. I wouldn't say that but I thought it. 

In my country, we don't have many mixed race people, as in part African and part white/european/whatever. Because we are a somewhat young country in terms of white invasion (""settlement""), there are still lots of people immigrating from Africa, plus we have some refugees who are settling here as well. Most of the Kenyans I work with have Kenyan girlfriends here. We have entire suburbs where most people have immigrated from Asia, and their kids are the first generation here. Store writing is all in Chinese or Vietnamese etc. There's still a lot of separation, because people just feel more comfortable with what they know. When people move to a new country, they prefer to go where there are many other people from their area and where they can get their groceries easily or eat food at a restaurant that they're familiar with and like, and not have to put as much effort into learning fluent English because we have so many pockets of direct immigrants.

There are some issues with racism, because apart from indigenous people, English invaded and settled here first, then many Mediterranean immigrants. So that formed its own Euro culture here, then there was a lot more Asian and Southeast Asian immigration and they did not assimilate in many areas and basically just made entire suburbs into little ""China Towns"". There are some European background people, especially lower socioeconomic groups and older generations who are quite racist towards Asian people here. If you go into a major city here then majority of people you walk by will be Asian/Southeast Asian and some people find that upsetting because they think this was supposed to be a ""white"" country and there has been so much change they've seen and it's not familiar or comfortable for them. That's where the racism comes from here. Though some people are just flat out shit people and are racist for no reason at all. Then we have people who are really against refugees and ""boat people"" which Australia gets a fair amount of. That's a big issue because they are put on offshore detention centres  (including children) where conditions are horrible and there's a lot of suicide. Complex issue as many of them have no identification when they come here. So that becomes another racial issue for some. 

But as far as African people, they are arriving more recently, and there are some racial issues. The main one being that a percentage of them are refugees and they sometimes come from very violent unstable parts of Africa. They can have mental health issues, cultural differences etc and we're having an issue with very young boys forming ""gangs"" and robbing houses, carjacking people etc. Some if it is blown out of proportion and it's not just people from Africa involved in gang related activity, plenty of white gangland shit here.. but the issue is these African boys are usually underaged so they can't be prosecuted as adults or have any really serious consequences and they know that, so they can get lawless and feel invincible. Some of them were stealing things from someone I know (out of his car), he discovered them doing it and ran out with a bat and was telling them to get away. One came at him with a weapon and he hit him with the bat, causing serious injury, and now the man who was being robbed is in prison for a very long time and the kids (15-17 type ages) are free. Issues like that. Our laws protect criminals quite a lot in this country and you are not allowed to defend yourself with weapons. So there is a lot of outrage about these things and stronger attitudes form against refugees which will also impact attitude towards regular Africans who are just here on student visas and then intend to get permanent residency (which are ones I work with).

The African people I work with have to work very hard to be here and study here. They have to pay their course fees up front each semester and they get no government loan scheme like I did or any Australian can get. They're working their asses off, but these refugee and first generation kids are starting to cause a bad reputation for the rest of the ordinary people who saved up money and came here to study, work and immigrate. But some racists lump them in with violent refugees and have a lot of resentment, because the refugees get paid more welfare than elderly Australians do on their pensions. They're given huge help financially that Australians and regular African immigrants will never get, yet a minority of them act lawless and don't appreciate being in a safer country and having money handed to them, which causes anger especially to the people who live near where the government gives them housing. 

But those issues have calmed down lately and the news is no longer obsessed with the ""apex"" gang. I live in a very multicultural area and with many Africans and we're not experiencing any racism or aggression based on appearance that anyone is talking about in my circle for what that's worth"

Because they are far more like to be affiliated with gangs, to be athletic and to spend time with older black males.

&gt;Black men are perceived as more aggressvie

Vox is really not a source friend. But again, it's because they commit more crime and are more likely to be in gangs.

Again, WP is not a good source. Media does nothing but try to mimick reality in an entertaining way. Media presents black people like this because it is commonly what people see in their own real lives.

This source, which references a variety of other extremely biased sources claims that people who have had similar childhoods, still get paid differently based on race.

However in my 4 years of reddit u/techfronic is without a doubt one of the most racist and vile ignorant assholes I've ever come into contact with.

* [In this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/8l349f/6_killed_32_wounded_in_chicago_weekend_violence/dzdmie4), he states that areas in Canada with more minorities are more likely to have crime
* [Over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/95v02r/comment/e3w6ppk/?st=JTBOH60K&amp;sh=193067de) he advocates for the killing of black men by stating, from this comment you can see that he insinuates that black people are more likely to engage in violent crime because of their race and states that's why police have authority to shoot and kill them

&gt; There's a large gap in violent crime rates that can't be explained by differences in arrest rate. Behavioral differences across races is extremely relevant because the police make decisions on how to act based on the behavior of suspects. 

* [Once again](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/8g82nq/comment/dya7x8m?st=JTBONUB5&amp;sh=be736790) he shows his bias against African Americans by stating

&gt;Black people are much more racist TBH. I've never seen an Asian person openly disrespecting a black person. It's either subtly or behind the back in a foreign language where it doesn't affect the black person. On the other hand, black people yell out racist shit all the time in poor immigrant's fsces. Just walk into an Asian restaurant in the hood and watch how the black people act.

&gt;It doesn't come from nothing. Asians are racially targeted for crimes by black people. Because many Asians are poor they get stuck in the ghetto hood that's completely hostile to Asians. The racially targeted rapes, thefts, burglaries and assaults have caused trauma in the Asian community.  
&gt;  
&gt;You just don't see the other side where ghetto black people say and do the most racist shit to Asians in the hood because those Asians don't have the English ability or money to make a stink and sue like the people in the article.

&gt;  
&gt;African Americans from African immigrant families have very dark skin and are physically/objectively ugly to me, no racial, but there is something about them that gets me emotionally drawn to them and wanting to wife them. They're well mannered like someone else said and they generally aren't as basic as other girls. I can almost instantly tell when a black American girl is from an African immigrant family through her speech and clothes.""

There's nothing wrong with having a preference by stating that someone is ugly simply on the basis of their color, is racist. And he also stated that American black girls aren't ""well mannered"" and they don't ""dress"" as well as African immigrants. As an African immigrant myself, I've never noticed anything like this. And this post shows how he really feels about African Americans.

&gt;  
&gt;The scope of the advantage is small. It's only for one college. Affirmative action gives an advantage to all Hispanic and black people. Every single black or Hispanic college student displaces someone who deserves it more.

  u/techtronic why did you state that ""Every single black or Hispanic college student displaces someone who deserves it more."" Are you implying that black and hispanic people are not capable of getting into college, what exactly makes them so undeserving?

From this study you quoted: ""Of the 183 million whites in 1998, police killed 225; of the 27 million blacks, police killed 127. While the rate (per million population) at which blacks were killed by police in 1998 was about 4 times that of white""

Also, this study has a number of deficiencies:
1. The deadly response test performed in front of an ""HD screen"", not based on real world incidents. As such, its results can't be taken as indicative of real world trends.

2. The study refers to it's subjects as ""people"", not police officers. 

&gt;Or that black women are the most educated?

&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/black-women-become-most-educated-group-in-us-a7063361.html

That's not what it says. It says that Black women are more educated compared to black men. It also goes on to say this: ""However, a recent study found black women make up just 8 per cent of private sector jobs and 1.5 per cent of leadership roles."" So thank you for further reinforcing my point I guess.

I also notice that you conveniently ignored the majority of the other links I provided. Please address those as well, and try not to explain away everything with ""It's biology!"".

53,eh89at1,"What is it like to teach in a black school?
""The mainstream press gives a hint of what conditions are like in black schools, but only a hint. Journalists use phrases like “poor learning environment” or “lack of discipline”, but it does not capture what really happens. There is nothing like the day-to-day experience of teaching black children and that is what I will try to convey. 
One of the most immediately striking things about my students was that they were loud. They had little conception of ordinary decorum. It was not unusual for five students to be screaming at me at once. They seemed to have no conception of waiting for an appropriate time to say something. They would get ideas in their heads and simply had to shout them out. 
Anyone who is around young blacks will probably get a constant diet of rap music. Blacks often make up their own jingles, and it was not uncommon for 15 boys to swagger into a classroom rapping—in the crudest terms imaginable—that all womankind is sexually devoted to them. For whatever reason, my students would often groan instead of saying a particular word, as in, “She suck dat aaahhhh (think of a long grinding groan), she f**k dat aaaahhhh, she lick dat aaaahhh.”
Many black people, especially women, are enormously fat. Some are so fat I had to arrange special seating to accommodate their bulk. There are plenty of white anorexics, but I have never met or heard of a black anorexic. 
Blacks, on average, are the most directly critical people I have ever met: “Dat shirt stupid. Yo’ kid a bastard. Yo’ lips big, He halfbreed.” Unlike whites, who tread gingerly around the subject of race, they can be brutally to the point. 
Most of the blacks I taught simply had no interest in academic subjects. I taught history, and would give them assignments on “diversity” history. My favorite was Marcus Garvey. They had never heard of him, and I would tell them to research him, but they never did. They didn’t care and they didn’t want to do any work.
Once I decided to fill 25 minutes by having students write about one thing the government should do to improve America. My white students came back with generally “conservative” ideas. Nearly every black gave a variation on the theme of “We need more government services.” My students had only the vaguest notion of who pays for government services. For them, it was like a magical piggy bank that never goes empty. 
There is a level of conformity among blacks that whites would find hard to believe. They like one kind of music: rap. They will vote for one political party: Democrat. They dance one way, speak one way, are loud the same way, and fail their exams in the same way. Of course, there are exceptions but they are rare. 
One point on which all blacks agree is that everything is “racis’.” This is one message of liberalism they have absorbed completely. Did you do your homework? “Na, homework racis’.” Why did you get an F on the test? “Test racis”. My black students had nothing but contempt for Hispanic immigrants. Whites were “racis’,” of course, but they thought of us at least as Americans. Not the Mexicans. 
What about black boys and white girls? No one is supposed to notice this or talk about it but it is glaringly obvious: Black boys are obsessed with white girls. I’ve witnessed the following drama countless times. A black boy saunters up to a white girl. The cocky black dances around her, not really in a menacing way. It’s more a shuffle than a threat. As he bobs and shuffles he asks, “When you gonna go wit’ me?” If the girl says ""no"", there is only one response from the black boy: “You racis’.” Many girls—all too many—actually feel guilty because they do not want to date blacks. Most white girls at my school stayed away from blacks, but a few, particularly the ones who were addicted to drugs, fell in with them. There is something else that is striking about blacks. They seem to have no sense of romance, of falling in love. What brings men and women together is sex, pure and simple, and there is a crude openness about this. 
There was a lot of promiscuous sex among my students and this led to violence. Black girls were constantly fighting over black boys. It was not uncommon to see two girls literally ripping each other’s hair out with a police officer in the middle trying to break up the fight. The black boy they were fighting over would be standing by with a smile, enjoying the show he had created. For reasons I cannot explain, boys seldom fought over girls.
Black schools are violent, the violence is astonishing, not so much that it happens, but the atmosphere in which it happens. Blacks can be smiling, seemingly perfectly content with what they are doing, having a good time, and then, suddenly start fighting. It’s uncanny. 
There is an unutterable secret among teachers: Almost all realize that blacks do not respond to traditional white instruction. Whites have learned a certain way for centuries but it just doesn’t work with blacks. It is what brings about endless, pointless innovation that is supposed to bring blacks up to the white level. The solution is more diversity—or put more generally, the solution is change. Change is an almost holy word in education, and you can fail a million times as long as you keep changing. But into what? No one knows, but we must keep changing until we find something that works. That is why they keep revamping the curriculum and the way it is taught."" 
"
54,ehjla16,"For all too many British children, the phrase “childhood innocence” is an oxymoron. For my post-war generation, William Brown and his Outlaws would be as close as most of us came to being part of a gang and Richmal Crompton’s eponymous hero’s scraped knees and torn blazer the worst damage anyone suffered. Fifty years on from the last Just William book, the redoubtable Children’s Commissioner for England has thrown a bucket of cold water over any lingering romance attached to such childhood memories.

Anne Longfield’s report, published yesterday, into childhood violence and vulnerability asserted that some 27,000 under-19s identify themselves as gang members. More than 300,000 admit to knowing someone who is in a gang. In the past week alone, nine boys have died in English cities, mostly from stab wounds after vicious, coordinated attacks. NHS officials report that the number of non-lethal assaults of this kind is now running into the thousands. Some of those involved with gangs, according to the Commissioner, have yet to see their tenth birthday.

Longfield’s report is based on detailed examination of data from the ONS’s British Crime Survey, backed by a wealth of other research. She points out that children sucked into the spiral of violence are more likely than average to come from homes where parents are violent towards each other and to their families; where adults take drugs and allow their children to copy them; and where others have been involved in criminal activity. Many have been excluded from school and placed in units where they are preyed upon by criminals.

To her credit, Longfield goes beyond the usual hand-wringing by linking her analysis to that of another, equally formidable public servant Dame Louise Casey, author of an uncompromising 2016 report into the grooming scandals in Rotherham, Rochdale and elsewhere. Casey told us what everyone knew but no one wanted to say: that the sexual crimes against hundreds of children, mostly white girls, were (and probably still are) being carried out by mostly British Pakistani Muslim men – but no one would ever point the finger at the perpetrators for fear of being denounced as racists and Islamophobes. Truth was sacrificed on the altar of racial tranquillity.

Though Longfield does not say so in terms, the evidence shows that the wave of killings and maimings we are seeing are assassinations of black children by other black children, all too often directed by adult drug dealers. And it pays to read the small print in her report. The technical appendices tell us that, in effect, race is the best predictor of being in a gang, being a victim of knife crime or of being a killer.

Among children who are not involved in gangs, more than 81 per cent are white and just 7 per cent black; but among those identified as gang members by social work practitioners the figures are 48 per cent white and 31 per cent black. Worse still, among those in greatest trouble – the “extensive offending group” in the jargon – black youngsters make up 37 per cent of the population compared to 39 per cent whites.

In essence, black boys are more than 20 times as likely to be involved in serious attacks compared with their white peers. I suspect that closer analysis of the data will point to the prevalence of terrible trauma suffered by refugee children which is now being parlayed into wanton violence. These children may need our sympathy and protection; they are also crying out for control and therapy.

Yet, to read our newspapers and to listen to our media, you would imagine that race played no part in this issue at all. The BBC in particular is guilty of whitewashing the truth. Its defence is that race should only be reported where it is relevant. Yet it has no qualms about routinely describing stop and search by police in racial terms. If the media thinks it can keep its racial innocence by saying nothing, it’s kidding itself.

The daily parade of dark faces in items about knife crime tells its own story. And the routine appearance of such individuals as “Olu from Brixton” in radio interviews would provoke howls of “racist dog-whistling” around Broadcasting House were the BBC’s own journalists not so deeply complicit in the silence.

Pointless arguments about police numbers and tough tactics will get us nowhere. Resources will be squandered and time lost. How many more black children have to die before politicians, police and the media are ready to face up to what is really taking place? We need to focus honestly on who is dying and who is doing the killing if we are to stop the carnage. But for the moment, it seems that as far as Britain’s establishment is concerned, #blacklivesjustdon’tmatteratall."
55,eieuei3,"&gt; ""We find converging evidence that Black boys are seen as older and less innocent and that they prompt a less essential conception of childhood than do their White same-age peers. Further, our findings demonstrate that the Black/ape association predicted actual racial disparities in police violence toward children.""

Seriously wtf “Black/ape association predicted actual racial disparities in police violence toward children."" That’s not true because:

1. Crime. 

• Teenage black males have the high- est victimization rate (113 per 1,000 in 1992), while elderly white females have the lowest rate (3 per 1,000). Teenagers in general have very high rates: 90 per 1,000 for teenage white males, 55 per 1,000 for teenage white females, and 94 per 1,000 for teenage black females.

• blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks.

• This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites.

• Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time. ([2](https://www.amren.com/news/2015/07/new-doj-statistics-on-race-and-violent-crime/). 


• Some observers argue that what causes the overwhelming preponderance of black-on-white over white-on-black violence is “chance of encounter,” due to the fact that there are five times as many whites

&gt; ""If you color code the districts based on their racial composition you see this very stark breakdown. At any given poverty level, districts that have a higher proportion of white students get substantially higher funding than districts that have more minority students.""

Yeah because they have no funding because they are living off of welfare and not paying taxes into the public school system. 

• A striking 82 percent of black households with children receive welfare–double the white rate. Hispanic families are not far behind blacks.

&gt; At 41.6 percent, blacks were more likely to participate in government assistance programs in an average month.

 &gt; The black participation rate was followed by Hispanics at 36.4 percent, Asians or Pacific

&gt; Islanders at 17.8 percent, and non-Hispanic whites at 13.2 percent. [2](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-97.html) 


&gt; Across both studies, the researchers found that racial stereotypes shaped teachers’ responses not after the first infraction but rather after the second. Teachers felt more troubled by a second infraction they believed was committed by a black student rather than by a white student.


This could go back to crime stats. I’m sure they Didn’t do nothing. 


&gt; ""Black students accounted for 15 percent of the student body in the 2015-2016 school year but 31 percent of arrests. Two years earlier, black students accounted for 16 percent of the student body and 27 percent of arrests. The data also show students with disabilities are far more likely to face suspension or arrests at school. They accounted for 12 percent of enrollment but 28 percent of all arrests and referrals to law enforcement.

Yes because they did something wrong duh. And disabilities yes there are a lot of black people with learning disabilities in sped. 

&gt; “The black unemployment rate is nearly or more than twice the white unemployment rate regardless of educational attainment. It is, and always has been, about twice the white unemployment rate”

Yes because they they don’t have the same graduation rate high school rate and don’t enroll at college at the same level at whites. It by choice I know many fine African Americans that got Ivey league school scholarships. 

They have every opportunity the rest of your arguments is the same PC bullshit that’s been mulled over and over again. The truth is you probably live in North Dakota or some 90% white states and the only info you get on this is from online. Coming from a predominately black town I can tell you crime is way worse even though there is an all black police force. Graduation rate is horrible because they don’t try and all of them live off of well fare. It’s not racists it is the truth. All of them have fathers that our absent etc. 

It’s not because people are racists. No ones barring them from doing anything but their own culture. They have more opportunities than whites. Affirmative action, gov. Assistance, the diversity narrative that been pushed. The only thing that is holding them back is them.

56,eeyv9b5,"That it made it so that in order to receive government benefits there could be no man in the home, incentivizing mother's to not attempt to reconcile or keep father's around for the benefit of their children in order to maximize monetary compensation.

These young black boys are now growing up without the extremely important aspect of an authoritative and disciplinary figure to keep them on track, often being raised alone with mothers who exert violent behavior disuading techniques that teach them horribly erroneous conflict resolution and often times turn to other sources of authority such as gangs to fill in this missing piece. This has become a self perpetuating cycle of absent black father's that lead to young men who become absent father's.

I will never claim that crime, drugs, racism, or poverty are not issues that the black community faces, but the destruction of the nuclear family in the black community is *by far* the most destructive thing that has ever happened to them.

How was it that there were *many* successful black communities during Jim Crow era racism while the family structure was intact, but now that government sponsored racism and to the same extent societal racism has *drastically* decreased the plight of the black communities has gotten *worse*?

Racism hurts, but it doesn't destroy. Broken families destroy."
57,ecboi2d,"Reading alot of the descriptions she sounds very mentally ill. Many have no views so I dont believe they are for anyone but her mind. Talks of being framed for crimes, her crush Quan being manipulated by her aunt n on drugs, banter about trannys being used against her,  her identity being stolen, cops wanting to kill her, a vietnamese gang, a violent phillipino hacking collective, look through the video descriptions. It's a very interesting look into a very mentally ill person.

Also she reveals ALOT about herself including her full name and address in one video description. As a bipolar individual, I really doubt this is anything but mental illness. And I'm the first to jump to ""conspiracies""

Edit: also she talks about being targeted at 11 n her identity stolen then. Framed for crimes because of race. Says her mom's car accidents was a hit, says friend Quan is brainwashed being drugged and given stds from Mrf trans women by is own mother. She even thinks her own loan statements aren't hers and says Quan mom changed her ups delivery route. Says random black girls are stealing her identity and are actually white trannies. There's alot! Just read her descriptions of her videos. I hope she gets help, it's very sad. This actually disturbs me more than a conspiracy because of this poor bright woman is very sick

Another edit: start from her earliest videos, read the titles and descriptions and, they make more sense that way and tells a very paranoid story between rambles."
58,ebmhac6,"As a teacher, let me save you the time: none of the studies actually address things like holistic behavior issues, or the communities the schools are in.

I teach in a title 1 highschool, so number like this just bemuse me, I know better from being a professional who does this day in and day out.  If anything, many black students avoid suspension because the admins realize it won't help anything.  At my school black girls are far more violent than black boys (odd, I know right?)  But black boys get suspended more often, because when they do fight they don't pull hair and such, they use things as weapons and have to get body slammed by the cops to get them to stop trying to kill the other dude.  Those kinds of incidents are pretty much exclusive to black boys.  

In general, pretty much anything you hear about education that sounds like it its biased to one political side or the other is almost assuredly stinking bullshit.  If you want to know about schools just visit some and ask, or go to a school board meeting."
59,e5lf3ne,"Name a NFL HOF player with a son in the league without googling it! Like I said injuries come with playing sports. If a guy plays football from ages 5-20 and then gets cut from an NFL team will still have CTE to a serious degeee, having an NFL career only makes it certain that he will. Sure, other sports are risky, but fball is irresponsible on behalf the parents. Kids don't make logical decisions about future quality of life...but a parent will live vicariously thru them.

To your ""inner city"" point, I wholeheartedly agree that it has kept lots of men from Hong hands etc, but now it's clearly a sociopolitical agenda to destroy black men in this country. I know, I know...always bringing up race, but follow me.

Melanated men have been targets on this land since whites came here in the 1400's and killing them today is clearly not frowned upon by some people. With that said, millions of black boys are trying to make it to the NFL where over 90% won't make it, but will have probably had college football experience and others just high school...ALL will have cognitive symptoms of CTE. Volatility, violence &amp; confusion are well known symptom of having the disease, thus perpetuating the false notion that black men are inherently violent and dangerous giving police more of a green light to murder people even though it's now a mental health issue.

My point is, at its core, fball is inherently dangerous and I don't think parents will wake up to how dangerous it truly is until someone actually does on the field.

60,e5i84iu,"preface - volcel male in a relatively new relationship (5mos) -  rant/ramble ahead. Take it or leave it.

I concede black girls are shafted dating wise, worse so than even asian men imo given how men can raise status via income, etc. It's definitely an uphill battle with which I cannot empathize. That said, do not give up.

Obviously, I can't say for sure because I don't know what's going through your head, but certain males definitely feel comparable pain due to mental reservations or ugliness as well. Toxicity aside, a solid portion of incels are basically in the position they're in because they're romantics like you unwilling to play the sex game. I myself was cheated on twice by two ex's because I refused to give it up until things got serious. That said, males in your position are more likely to cope with violent fantasies, which is not OK.

&amp;#x200B;

Can't speak for your looks, but a few pointers based on what I've seen and helped with in my female friends:

\- **assess your purpose**. This is especially hard when you're lonely. Nevertheless, a ship with no destination cannot take on passengers. Be aware that even if you could receive a relationship, you might not be able to handle one if you haven't prepared for it. Look at your life and get your shit together as best you can.

\- **assess your friend group.** Imo, modern culture is poison for introverts, and a lot of the cute irl meetings which used to happen gave way to more superficial hook-ups a la tinder. Compensate by looking around you. Do you have any male friends you never considered dating? Contacts from your female friends?  Doesn't happen as often with girls in my experience, but a ton of guys get oneitis early on and often don't realize they've got a girl crushing on them until it's too late.

\- **so long as you don't find them repulsive,** **consider dating someone you aren't attracted to, as well as making the first move.** Consider making moves, even on dudes you may not consider your ""type"" or are even attracted to. Multiple psychological studies show proximity, indication of interest, and familiarity can grow attraction in both sexes despite a lack of initial spark. It's a shame so many people get hung-up on initial indicators of attraction (IE- looks, status,  and presence) while never playing on these other variables. I wasn't attracted to my current gf (I shit you not) when I first asked her out, but did so on a limb because I appreciated her values and saw in her what guys call ""wife material"" (genuine investment in her friend group, history of strong, long-term friendships with both sexes, a good relationship with her family, demonstrated the ability to overcome difficulties and stick with long-term commitments in academic and career contexts,  monogamous, and similar morals based on past conversions), and I'm so happy I did, as she grew on me physically. I understand the opposite is true for many girls as well, taking chances on guys who were far from their first choice and ending up with very stable relationships and marriages. Besides, pretty much everyone is butt-ugly by 50 anyway, so you might as well look for values and willingness to work on a relationship early.

\- **assess your looks, but don't beat yourself up over what you can't change.** I cannot stress enough that there is no bigger turn-off for dudes than being fat. I'm sorry, but I'd be lying to you otherwise. Ugly faces are generally overlooked by the time dudes hit their 20s, especially since girls seem to find what hairstyles frame/accentuate their face best by then too, but weight is always (forgive the pun) the elephant in the room. Chubby is fine. Lack of curves is fine, but be honest with yourself regarding your figure. **warning- disregard this advice if you've had an eating disorder or history of BDD, as you likely cannot assess your weight accurately and should not put yourself in harm's way.**

&amp;#x200B;

\-**allow yourself to be loved**, seems like an oxymoron, but a ton of people here and  [incels.me](https://incels.me) likely wouldn't be able to accept love even it they were beaten over the head with it. I personally had this problem after being cheated on. Attraction is uncontrollable. Lust is uncontrollable. Love is neither, but rather a choice. There is no perfect girl or guy, and to project an ideal like that onto another person (or yourself) is recipe for disaster because you're looking for things which aren't there rather than appreciating the person (or yourself) for who they are. Everything is flawed, and it's better that way because it makes the choices you make all the more your own.

Best of luck, and take it easy"
61,e325cvp,"&gt; todays generations of black Americans have just as much opportunity as anyone else and just as much misfortune as anyone else. I'm aware there's still pocket communities of people with racist mentalities, however they are few and far between and have no influence. 

This is just demonstrably untrue. A large proportion of black people live in heavily crime ridden areas and are more likely to be targeted by the police and put in prison for non-violent offenses like smoking weed or graffiti. A lot of black boys are pressured into joining gangs or beaten up if they go outside their neighborhoods. Gang violence and drugs are a massive problem. Black people as a demographic are definitely provably disadvantaged, partly due to the actions of other Black people and partly due to a predatory system that's stacked against poor people.

However putting it in terms of ""privilege"" is just stupid and divisive. Call a spade a spade and call it disadvantage and lack of disadvantage. ""Privilege"" implies that white people don't deserve the lack of skin color discrimination, when in reality it's a baseline for how everyone should be treated. The word has become a stick to beat others with and self flagellate. "
62,e2tbjra,"I’ll give you that. But then is that WaW as much as it’s wantinf to get black boys out of their schools? White school administrators don’t think black girls are wonderful and have their own ways of punishinn and forcing them out of schools (see controversial dress codes relating to hair texture).

Since the only examples of WaW that have been given here relate to punishment for real or perceived crimes or violations of rules and policies, im going to conclude waw is limited to the perception that women are less violent than men as the extent of waw.

2. Starbucks stands out because it has embraced a role as a community meeting place where people read, work on computers or just hang out, whether they buy anything or not. those guys should not have been asked to leave.
3.Your european so you dont know how unfairly black men are treated in this country and it starts from elementary school where black boys are punished harsher than any other group for the doing the same things. You hear a story about a white woman calling the cops on 2 non violent black men waiting for a meeting at starbucks and no red flags go off in your head its possible that she was not racist but the men being black the situation is going to handled a different way because of their race thats the sad truth.
call a spade a spade these men being black their is going to be a way they are treated because they are black men.

watch the newer video where the police cheif admits that he was wrong. He has my respect because he admits he made an error and as humans we all make mistake so I commend him for being responsible enough to put his ego aside and say the truth.

Those men should not have been asked to leave they were not causing a disturbance but were there for a business meeting.

you dont believe race plays a part in this case as a European your perspective is different because you have not seen the racism or lived it first hand in America and as a black American man I can tell you that racism does still exist and even if the manager wasnt racist once the cops get involved black men get treated differently in general."

Hilariously ironic, as I will here prove.  
  
&gt;You ignore my points  
  
No, I've addressed that they don't offer the proof you're claiming they do. You need stronger evidence in order to support extraordinary claims. The assumption of discrimination is only that and nothing more.

No, I linked the source in the beginning and offered to give you the PDF. You are explicitly lying here, given that I have extended the availability of the study multiple times and even told you how to get it. You simply refuse to ""pirate"" or pay for it, and so you have used this to ignore the facts it offers.  
  
&gt;The accessible sources you do provide support claims other than the ones you intend to prove  
  
Quote? You misinterpreted and had to be corrected earlier, so I very much doubt you can offer anything like a quotation to support what you've just said here.  
  
&gt;I've provided numerous sources  
  
Link to those sources. I haven't seen you link much of anything supportive yet. You have quoted from some places that offered no data, which is like going off of your word.  
  
&gt;that would convince any reasonable person that discrimination is occurring  
  
Except for people who have reviewed the relevant empirical literature and know that a test of implicit bias does not mean that any discrimination is occurring or that it is incurring in the direction that you seem to think it does.  
  
&gt;the answer to my final question is no.  
  
The answer to your question is irrelevant and you have nothing to support the claim of ""no"" there. My claiming that you lack evidence for a terrible and baseless assumption is not evidence for discriminatory beliefs.  
  
Lets quote from [the study your quote referenced above](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0038040717694876):   
  
&gt;The results show troubling and significant disparities in the punishment of African American girls. Controlling for background variables, black girls are three times more likely than white girls to receive an office referral; this difference is substantially wider than the gap between black boys and white boys. Moreover, black girls receive disproportionate referrals for infractions such as disruptive behavior, dress code violations, disobedience, and aggressive behavior. We argue that these infractions are subjective and influenced by gendered interpretations. Using the framework of intersectionality, we propose that school discipline penalizes African American girls for behaviors perceived to transgress normative standards of femininity.  
  
Their proposal is baseless. They are using the existence of a gap to justify their presuppositions. Girls are less violent than boys, and they have a lower trait variance, therefore we would expect a larger difference between groups who vary in their mean, than between the boys. [Lets compare fighting propensities between Black and White female students](http://www.childtrends.org/?indicators=physical-fighting-by-youth) as a reasonable proxy for general misconduct. What does the data show? Oh, Black female students are almost twice as likely to be involved in a physical altercation. Interesting!  
  
Lets go further. There's [a great deal of reason and data](https://evoandproud.blogspot.com/2015/10/the-adaptive-value-of-aw-shucks.html) to suggest that deference follows male criminality, such that Black females are going to be less deferential to the degree that Black males are more criminal. The ""perceived norms"" item they cite is an argument, but it has no evidence, so lets look at quotes:  
  
&gt;Much feminist literature has described the relative silence of girls in classrooms and a concomitant drop in self-esteem for girls in their early teens (Sadker &amp; Sadker, 1994; American Association of University Women, 1992). But other work has noted that Black girls maintain their self-esteem and their classroom ""voice"" into adolescence despite the fact that they may feel neglected in education (Orenstein, 1994; Taylor et al., 1995). (Morris, 2007)  
  
&gt;Over a period of two years, Morris (2007) studied African American girls in grades 7 and 9 of an American middle school referred to as ""Mathews."" The students were 46% African American and the teachers two-thirds African American.

&gt;He found that African American girls seemed to feel little inhibition in the presence of boys:

&gt;Indeed, at Matthews I often observed girls—particularly Black girls—dominating classroom discussion.

&gt;[...] I noticed this active participation of girls to a greater extent in English classrooms, particularly when, as in this example, the subject concerned gender issues or relationships. However, the topic in this example also concerned computers and technology, areas more commonly dominated by boys. Furthermore, girls at Matthews, especially Black girls, spoke out to ask and answer questions in science and math classes as well, although to a lesser extent than in English and history classes. This willingness of African American girls to compete and stand up to others also emerged in their non-academic interactions with boys.

&gt;[...] Black girls at Matthews often challenged physical contact initiated by boys by hitting and chasing them back. They did not yield to and accept this behavior from boys, nor did they tend to seek adult authority to protect themselves and punish the boys.

&gt;[...] Thus, most African American girls in my observations did not hesitate to speak up in classrooms, and stand up to boys physically. Few Black girls I observed created disruptions in classrooms, but most consistently competed with boys and other girls to gain teachers' positive attentions.

&gt;[..] I observed this outspokenness at Matthews. Black girls there appeared less restrained by the dominant, White middle-class view of femininity as docile and compliant, and less expectant of male protection than White girls in other educational research.

&gt;These observations were consistent with those of the teachers, who generally described African American girls as being confrontational, loud, and unladylike:

&gt;Teachers, particularly women, often scolded Black girls for supposedly subverting their authority in the classroom. 

&gt;[...] By far the most common description and criticism of African American girls by all teachers at Matthews was that they were too ""loud.""

&gt;[...] For many adults at Matthews, the presumed loud and confrontational behavior of African American girls was viewed as a defect that compromised their very femininity. This emerged most clearly in educators castigating Black girls to behave like ""ladies.""  
  
And it goes on. There is no reason to suggest that the study that the GAO cited there is reliable or indicative of discrimination, so lets look at the other one they listed as a follow-up reference. That was -- wait a second you quotemined. Yes, I caught you quote mining to support your point, and it's plain and obvious to anyone who reads the GAO paper. You know what you did? You supplied the quote about video clips and left off the last part, which makes the full paragraph read:  
  
&gt;Further, the studies found that the types of offenses that Black children were disciplined for were largely based on school officials’ interpretations of behavior. For example, one study found that Black girls were disproportionately disciplined for subjective interpretations of behaviors, such as disobedience and disruptive behavior. A separate study used eye-tracking technology to show that, among other things, teachers gazed longer at Black boys than other children when asked to look for challenging behavior based on video clips. The Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) reported that this research has
highlighted implicit bias as a contributing factor in school discipline and
may shed some light on the persistent disparities in expulsion and
suspension practices, **even though the study did not find that teacher
gazes were indicative of how they would discipline students.**  
  
Wait, lets repeat this last part: **even though the study did not find that teacher
gazes were indicative of how they would discipline students.**  
  
You are a dishonest individual. That you mined for those quotes without including the part that disqualified what you were saying is display enough to me that you are not to be trusted. The only implicit bias here is [your egalitarian bias.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322631668_Equalitarianism_A_source_of_liberal_bias)"
68,ds7rbgw,"i've rarely ever had someone put me down for my race alone usually i get put down for being a black girl. not saying in anyway that black men don't experience racism but to me it seems like when someone stereotypes a black man like as being a dead beat dad, drug dealer, violent etc... most people will agree that its racist and wrong. but when black girls are stereotyped as us all being ghetto, angry, aggressive or whatever its just an ""opinion"" and the person who has a right to feel that way complete bullshit and cognitive dissonance. 

there has been no instances that i know of where people have done a racist action towards me that i know of or can think of at the top of my head however i've just endured a lot of verbal harassment for it. 

people will announce that they wouldn't date me because i'm black when i didn't even express interest in dating them which is annoying and can be hurtful but the two most annoying things is when people interpret my actions to fit the ""bitter black woman"" stereotype. i'm introverted and people will say i'm a bitch because i don't talk to them or look at them wrong? when i don't care about what they are doing. and i can't even defend myself because then i am an angry black woman. 

also just the double standards of how if i say something it can be seen as ghetto or angry but if a ""latina"" does it then its sexy. 

this isn't a personal thing but in the black community there are just a lot of double standards when it comes to black men and women. everyone is so quick to call out racism and mistreatment when it comes to black men but when it comes to black women crickets.... only black women say something. its so frustrating "
69,dp6j1z9,"I think I can give my own angle on this. I have been in the past been asked if I fetishize black women. I can't exactly remember how that came up in conversation, I wasn't just openly telling people I only like black girls, though at the time I may have said it was a preference if asked. I grew up in schools that were mostly black so my first crush was black and most of the attractive people I saw were black. I didn't know many attractive white women until college. I had and still have only dated black women but I'm only 22 and my pool is small, especially considering my current relationship is with a girl from my high school and has been sort of on and off since high school. So empirically, I prefer black women. In reality, I guess I like darker skin and maybe being in the south I relish the idea of pissing off people (have experienced this firsthand) but it's unimportant for what I look for in potential relationships. So for that aspect of your argument, I guess I agree.

That being said, may we entertain the idea that one's personal preference, while itself isn't racist, could be rooted in racism? There have been several studies that say that men of all races tend to see black women as the least attractive, while for men, women typically see Asian men as least attractive. White men and white women are usually seen as most attractive across all races. I think both can be explained by stereotypes (accurate or not) and societal forces. Let's just take Asian men. What's the typical stereotypes of an Asian male? Book smart, short, scrawny or fat, small penis. All of these stereotypes of Asian men go against traditional western masculinity. Black women are often stereotyped as being loud/obnoxious/dumb, angry/aggressive, muscular/manly. All of these stereotypes are not traditionally feminine. Each of these plays into the 19th century ""scientific"" idea that black people are lower IQ and more primitive and violent. That's why I don't think it's particularly useful for someone to say they have racial preferences for dating. Thing is, black women and Asian men know they are seen as less desirable. Someone reaffirming that just isn't useful, and I might classify it as racist if I see someone broadcasting that for no reason. I'm going to assume that ""Hey, you're pretty for a white girl"" is much less common than ""Hey, you're pretty for a black girl"", something at least 3 of my friends have told me they have heard. When I was active on Imgur, I saw variations of ""I find black women as less attractive/unattractive"" make it to the front page quite often via (un)popular opinion puffin or confession bear memes. I've seen people post it on Facebook. I remember one guy talking about it unprompted while we were changing for PT in JROTC in high school, talking about how white girls are the best because black girls are significantly less tight than white or latina girls (side note: dude was dating a close friend (Puerto Rican) so I told her what he said and she ended that).  Not only are these things demoralizing, but because of things like the bandwagon effect or other groupthink phenomena, it can also sway some people to start thinking that maybe these other people are right when they say black women are less attractive. I don't think the statement has the same weight when you replace black with white. In a similar vein, things like saying black hairstyles are unattractive or worse, unprofessional is also problematic. So I guess my point is that while it might not be intended as racist, it definitely can have racial consequences.  "
70,dpjyly2,"Not *no* way—but it’s a VERY small chance. Do you know how deluded it is to assume that your beauty ideals and standards weren’t affected by white supremacy when white supremacy quite literally has shaped our world for the past few centuries? 

First of all, preferences for things like nose shapes and jaw lines are *also* often rooted in white supremacist ideals. People may not even realize it—but white Eurocentric beauty standards were, and still are, enforced strictly across the world...often in deadly and violent ways. This leads to cultures which, over time, highly idealize Eurocentric features and treat people with Eurocentric features better: they’re called prettier, get better jobs, tend to earn more money, are cast as actors and models, etc. 

Second of all, preferences for things such as butt size and eye colors tend to be more innocent because, uh, we never had institutionalized and systemic bigotry + genocide + enslavement of certain peoples due to their butt sizes or eye colors. Unless you’re reading a different world history textbook than I am... 

Someone who thinks they don’t like dark skin may not be *actively* racist in the sense that they may not look at dark people and think *Ew, mud people, gross, savage!* 

But racism isn’t just the obvious stuff. It’s the subtle, deeply-ingrained-in-our-psyche-and-upbringing stuff too. And if most of the people who think they dislike dark skin sat down and REALLY evaluated their own tastes unflinchingly, they would soon realize that something is fishy. 

“Well, I don’t like dark skin because growing up, most of my crushes were like the Disney princesses and other such female characters who happened to be light!” Hmmm, but did they really *happen* to be light? Or was it a case of dark-skinned pretty characters hardly being created because of, you gotcha, racism, 

“Well, I just think fair skin looks more glowing and healthy, it’s not that I think dark skin is ugly or anything!” Well, why do you think fair skin is more healthy and glowing? Where did this image come from? Black skin can be healthy and glowing af, so how come your mind can’t see it? 

“Growing up, I was only exposed to white girls or light girls, I just never really got a chance to meet and fall for dark women.” Sure, and that’s fine, we can’t control where we grow up—but I grew up without thin-crust NY pizza and now that I’m grown, I was fully able to try t and enjoy it. Not experiencing something shouldn’t automatically lead to dislike or dismissal—and you should question why you were never exposed to really dark people growing up. Were they not welcome in your community for Reasons? Why did you never encounter beautiful dark people in magazines and TV, if not in person? 

“Well, I just had some bad experiences with black and/or dark girls growing up, so you know...” Well, A) grown ups are usually able to seperate their bad individual experiences from the group of people in general, and B) why were they bad experiences? Was it genuinely a bad experience? Or—and be honest now—was it something like “These black girls are so noisy and ratchet and annoying!” and the experiences were colored by, YOU GOT IT, racism? 

Just offering some of the most common excuses for why men claim they don’t like darkskinned girls and showing that if you introspect a little (or a lot), most of them start falling apart. 

You can’t come at me with just your feelings because what I’m saying has been HEAVILY and extensively researched and studied. You NEED to educate yourself on how white supremacy has affected beauty standards before trying to claim that not liking dark skin is a totally innocent preference. The experts and really knowledgeable people in these studies would disagree. "

Anyway:

&gt; Straight Black Men Are the White People of Black People

&gt; It feels counterintuitive to suggest that straight black men as a whole possess any sort of privilege—particularly the type of privilege created for and protected by whiteness. In America, we are near or at the bottom in every relevant metric determining quality of life. Our arrest and incarceration rates, our likelihood of dying a violent death, our likelihood of graduating high school and attending college, our employment rates, our average net worth, our likelihood of surviving past 70—I could continue, but the point is clear.

&gt; But assessing our privilege (or lack thereof) on these facts considers only our relationship with whiteness and with America. Intraracially, however, our relationship to and with black women is not unlike whiteness’s relationship to us. In fact, it’s eerily similar. 

Really? Really? Are you *sure* about that?

Because I think you'll find that in every single metric you just mentioned with the exception of net worth, black women are *better off* than black men.

Arrest/incarceration? Well, I haven't found a specific source on black men vs. black women, but black people make up a big enough percentage of the prison population that their gender ratio would have to be fairly close to that of the country as a whole. In the US overall, men are more than ten times more likely than women to be incarcerated.

Violent death? [Black men are over five times more likely to be murdered than black women assuming a 50-50 gender ratio](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-1). The same goes for the focus of Black Lives Matter: police brutality. IIRC black men are at more than *twenty* times greater risk of being killed by police.

Education? [this is a bit old, but I see a lot more black girls than black boys graduating high school.](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/tables/AFGR.asp) This pattern most likely continues in college.

Employment? [Unemployment rates are very slightly higher for black men than black women.](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpsee_e16.htm) Over age 25 it's a bit higher for black women, but under age 25 there's a huge disparity, with black men in the 16-19 and 20-24 age groups about 50% more likely to be unemployed.

Life expectancy? Let's put it this way: female life expectancy is so consistently longer in every single country in the damn world, even in impoverished hellholes, that the burden of proof is on you if you want to show lower life expectancy for women in any segment of the population.

&gt; We’re the ones for whom the first black president created an entire initiative to assist and uplift.

Erm... yes. Please refer to the statistics on education, incarceration, violent death, and youth unemployment that I just posted. Black boys are clearly *more in need of such assistance* than black girls. Not to mention that black girls already have a shit-ton of other government programs aimed at helping them for being girls.

But I guess *now* it's AllLivesMatter, as soon as there's a single social program that doesn't specifically benefit you.

&gt; We’re the ones whose beatings and deaths at the hands of the police galvanize the community in a way that the beatings and sexual assaults and deaths that those same police inflict upon black women do not. 

[citation needed.] Anecdotally, I've heard just as much of a shitstorm over black women being killed by police as black men. If your wondering why black men's deaths seem to be getting more attention overall, it's because as mentioned, more than TWENTY TIMES more black men than black women are killed by police. AFAIK usable data is not available on non-fatal police violence.

&gt; We’re the ones whose mistreatment inspired a boycott of the NFL despite the NFL’s long history of mishandling and outright ignoring far worse crimes against black women. 

Is this about the NFL failing to adequately punish black players who were accused of Crimes Against Women but not convicted? (you'd think The Root would know better than to automatically believe sex crime accusations against black men) Or is it about their punishing players who were convicted and already punished by the justice system?

&gt; We are the ones who get the biggest seat at the table and the biggest piece of chicken at the table despite making the smallest contribution to the meal.

...what. The smallest contribution to the meal? You do realize that food costs money, right? Anybody want to pull up the ""hours worked"" stats, for me? As for seats... not to be stereotypical, but given the rate of single parenthood in the black community I think it's more accurate to say that lots of black men don't have a seat at the table *at all.* And a decent number of those are still paying child support.

&gt; And nowhere is this more evident than when considering the collective danger we pose to black women and our collective lack of willingness to accept and make amends for that truth.

&gt; But when black women share that we pose the same existential and literal danger to them that whiteness does to us;

You know what *really* sounds like the relationship between blackness and whiteness here? The idea that one group of people ""poses a collective danger"" to another. Which groups are seen as inherently violent, criminal, and dangerous? Blacks, and men. Note that if you flip race and gender, the author would be near-universally condemned as an Uncle Tom for saying that blacks ""pose a collective danger"" to the white community, and I can't say I'd disagree with that.

&gt; Although we recognize that not all white people are actively racist, we want them to accept that all benefit from racism, and we become annoyed when individual whites take personal exception and center themselves in any conversation about race, claiming to be one of the “good ones” and wishing for us to stop and acknowledge their goodness. 

I would comment on the open display of anti-white prejudice in this passage, but at this point I'm pretty sure The Root's editors have actually made a rule requiring every article published on their site to include some statement to the effect of: ""And they're *all* racist, even if they don't do or say or think anything racist, because of collective guilt!"" I can't even blame the author anymore.

Instead, I'd like to say that this shit right here is why I believe intersectionality was a mistake. Instead of uniting people, it drives them apart, completely and utterly destroying any solidarity in a movement by declaring larger and larger sections of your group oppressors. In this case, there's a particular cruel irony that the group being pushed out are by any reasonable standard the ones worst-affected by the issues affecting the larger demographic."

73,dohi0ax,"&gt; War on Drugs
&gt; 
&gt; Similar disparities between the practice of racial profiling and actual crime rates can be seen in the “War on Drugs”:
&gt; 
&gt; Blacks are less than 13% of the U.S. population, and they make up only 14% of regular drug users, but they are 37% of those arrested for drug offenses, and 56% of those in state prisons for drug offenses.[9]
&gt; Black kids are 10 times more likely to be arrested for drug crimes than white kids [11]—even though white kids are more likely to abuse drugs[11].
&gt; Blacks aged 18-25 are less likely than whites to have used marijuana in the last 12 months[12]:
&gt; Blacks of all ages are also more likely never to have used marijuana[12]:
&gt; 
&gt; And yet, black arrest rates for marijuana are astronomically higher—and the disparity is only getting worse[12]:
&gt; 
&gt; In Seattle in 2002, “African Americans constituted 16% of observed drug dealers for the five most dangerous drugs but 64% of drug dealing arrests for those drugs.”[13]
&gt; In the late 1990s, black and white women had similar levels of drug use during pregnancy, but black women were 10 times as likely as white women to be reported to child services for prenatal drug use.[14]

&gt; Neuspiel, D.R. (1996). “Racism and Perinatal Addiction”. Ethnicity and Disease
&gt; Meanwhile, the War on Drugs has been a total failure. It has been completely ineffective at changing drug use or addiction in the U.S.:
&gt; 
&gt; When Richard Nixon declared the “War on Drugs” in 1971, the U.S. addiction rate was approximately 1.3%. [15]
&gt; Today, that number is unchanged: 1.3%.[15]
&gt; Nor has it spiked or dipped significantly at any point in the 40+ years of the War on Drugs—it has floated with unwavering consistency in between 1.0% and 1.5% for 45 years.[15]
&gt; Drug use among teens has not decreased; in fact, in recent years there seems to be a moderate increase.[16]
&gt; What fluctuations there have been have no correlation whatsoever to enforcement of the War on Drugs.[16]
&gt; Recent data show that marijuana legalization hasn’t made teens more likely to use marijuana.[17]

&gt; The devastatingly destructive effect of the War on Drugs on communities of color, especially the black community, cannot be overstated. It is completely ineffective in its stated goal; it has not reduced drug use, nor has it reduced addiction in the United States. Meanwhile, the drug trade is stronger than ever.

&gt; What the War on Drugs has done is trap millions of people, especially black men, in poverty, and push them toward a life of crime. With black boys arrested 10 times more frequently than white boys, for a non-violent crime that they commit less frequently than white boys, black men are funneled into the criminal justice system from a young age. With felonies on their records, it is incredibly difficult for black men to get work (see Employment below). As a result, they are trapped in low-paying jobs, or worse, turning to crime.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, time spent in juvenile detention centers and state and federal prisons exposes young boys and men of color to the harder criminal element. Prison acts as a sort of “Crime U,” where non-violent offenders whose only crime was smoking a little weed—something a majority of Americans, especially white Americans, do at some point in their lives (82% of drug-related arrests in 2013 were for possession only, not dealing[18])—are encouraged and taught to commit increasingly worse crimes.
&gt; 
&gt; At the same time, the War on Drugs has given rise to criminal organizations that are both difficult to escape (even for kids trying to avoid gang life), and often appear to provide greater opportunity than getting a job and abiding by the law. In addition to juvenile detention and prison time, disparate rates of suspension and expulsion (see Education, below) bring young men of color into contact with the gang element, increasing the likelihood that they will become affiliated with a gang.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, once they have a felony on their record, most states prohibit them from voting. Thus, the War on Drugs has become a new Jim Crow, a law enforcement policy that unfairly and disproportionately targets black men, which results in their disenfranchisement (see Voting, below) and effectively permanent relegation to an American underclass.
&gt; 
&gt; The War on Drugs has not only failed—it has created, fueled, and currently supports the very thing it purports to fight. Its only legacy is lifelong marginalization and disenfranchisement of millions of black and Latino men, and the utter destruction of countless communities of color. It is Prohibition all over again, and it has failed to reduce substance abuse, addiction, crime rates, or any other ill associated with drug use—in fact, it has caused all of these things to increase, for the exact same reasons that Prohibition caused all of these things to increase[19].

&gt; Prison
&gt; 
&gt; The U.S. has seen a surge of arrests over the past 4 decades, and an absolute explosion in the prison population. The primary reason for this increase is the War on Drugs (see above), which is wholly ineffective, disproportionately targets people of color to extreme degrees, and has created a culture of crime that has trapped black men in poverty.
&gt; 
&gt; The U.S. prison population rose by 700% from 1970 to 2005, mostly as a result of the War on Drugs.[20]
&gt; The United States has 5% of the world’s population, but we house 25% of the world’s prisoners.[9]
&gt; There are currently more black people locked up in prison than there were enslaved in 1850.[21]
&gt; 1 in every 15 black men (and 1 in every 36 Latino men) are currently incarcerated, while for white men the statistic is 1 in 106.[22]
&gt; 1 in 3 black men can expect to go to jail at some point in their lifetimes.[22]
&gt; Minorities are less than 28% of the U.S. population[23], but they are nearly 60% of the prison population[24][25]. Blacks in specific are less than 13% of the U.S. population[26], but they are 38% of the American prison population[24][27]. This is not simply because black men are committing more crimes—see Poverty, below.
&gt; African American juvenile youth is only 16% of the U.S. population, but they are 28% of juvenile arrests, 37% of the youth in juvenile jails, and 58% of the youth sent to adult prisons.[28][29]
&gt; Black boys are five times as likely to go to jail as white boys; Latino boys are 3 times as likely.[9]
&gt; The average cost of prison in the United States is $31,307 per year for each inmate[30]. That’s the equivalent of 3 years in-state tuition at UCLA[31].
&gt; In many states, the cost of incarcerating a single inmate per year is much higher than the national average. In California, it is $47,421 per year; in states like Connecticut, Washington, and New York, it’s anywhere from $50,000 to $60,000 per year.[30]
&gt; The cost of federal prison ranges from $21,006 per inmate per year for minimum security, to $33,930 per inmate per year for high security.[32]

WHITE MEN - I think it's time for you to consider not dating, marrying or having sex with white girls anymore, and only dating Asian women from now on. 

White girls are traitors. By the time they're in their thirties, 90 percent of all white girls have had sex with at least one nigger boy. Once a white girl has sex  with a nigger, she becomes tainted and is no longer good enough for a White man. Think about all the violent crime niggers commit against White people. MILLIONS of  White people have been murdered, raped, assaulted or mugged by niggers in America. And these white girls condone it when they have sex with a nigger boy! ANY and EVERY  white girl that has ever had sex with a nigger is endorsing black-on-White crime, and giving aid and comfort to the enemy (niggers that commit hate crimes against  White people). White men, do you really want to date a white girl that did that? It's time for you White men to seriously consider no longer dating, marrying, having  sex with, or even being friends with white girls that fuck niggers, and since most white girls have fucked at least one nigger boy (that probably committed a hate  crime against your fellow Whites), it's time to consider no longer dating, marrying, havng sex with or being friends with white girls at all, and only dating,  marrying, and having sex with Asian women. Asian women and White men make a GREAT combination, and unlike with white girls, when you date an Asian woman you won't be getting a nigger thug's sloppy seconds. 

Should White men shun white women/girls that have sex with blacks? 

I say yes, they should. 

First of all, here are some facts: blacks commit a very, very large amount of violent crime against white people. Every year in America, and despite being outnumbered by whites five to one, blacks commit eight times more crimes against whites than vice-versa, according to FBI statistics from 2007. A black male is 40 times as likely to assault a white person as the reverse. These figures also show that interracial rape is almost exclusively black on white. More than 6.6 million violent crimes (murder, rape, assault and robbery) are committed in the US each year, of which about 20 per cent, or 1.3 million, are inter-racial crimes. Most victims of race crime—about 90 per cent—are white, according to the survey ""Highlights from 20 Years of Surveying Crime Victims"", published in 1993. Black males make up 06% of the population. They are responsible for 36.9% of all violent crime(per DOJ stats). 

The black crime rate is 7 times higher than non-hispanic white crime rate for the following crimes: Murder, rape, armed robbery, aggravated assault - in other words,  all violent crime. More than 1,600 Whites are murdered by Blacks each year. Blacks murder Whites at 18 times the rate Whites murder Blacks. 

In the last 30 years, 170 million violent and nonviolent crimes were committed by Blacks against Whites in the U.S. Blacks under 18 are more than 12 times more likely to commit murder than Whites the same age. 

Some 90% of the victims of race crimes are Whites. Blacks commit 7.5 times more violent interracial crimes than Whites, although they comprise only one-seventh of the White population. 

On a per-capita basis, blacks commit 50 times more violent crimes than Whites.  Some 27 million nonviolent crimes were committed in the U.S. in 1992 alone. 31% of the robberies involved Black offenders and White victims; only 2% involved White offenders and Black victims. 

1.3 million of the 6.6 million violent crimes committed in the U.S. each year are interracial. Between 1964 and 1994, more than 45,000 people were killed in interracial murders in the U.S., compared to 58,000 Americans killed in Vietnam and 38,000 killed in Korea. White women and girls seem to love all this. For the past couple decades, it has been ""trendy"" and ""hip"" for white females, especially those in their teens and twenties, to have as much casual sex with black males as they possibly can. It is incredibly easy for a black male to have sex with a white girl in America today, probably easier than it is for a white male. White females are practically throwing themselves at black males. Young white women actively seek out black males for sex, probably more than they seek out white males for sex. 

It needs to be said: white girls and women are incredibly sexually and romantically accessible to the same black males that rob, murder, and assault white men. In fact, I'll go further, and state this: these white women and girls think black males are superior to white males, and that the black race is superior to the white race. They are literally racist against their own race, especially men of their own race. 

But this behavior is usually just ""a phase"". When these white girls hit their thirties, and their breasts start to sag, and their bodies aren't so tight anymore, and they start losing their looks, they suddenly do a 180 and decide they want to get with white men. However, when it comes to prospective white male partners, white women get a lot more picky. Whereas they used to drop their panties at any brotha that would look their way, they become incredibly selective about white men: their white male partners must have a nice job, own their own house, and have lots of money. In other words, they want a white man to take care of them financially. 

There are many white men who, when they are young, can't get white females their age to look at them twice, because an astronomical amount of white women prefer black thugs - the same black thugs that commit violent crime against white people. Then when these young white females turn into old white women, they want to come crawling back to white men and be accepted by them. Wait, no... they don't come crawling back... they come strutting back with their noses held high in the air, acting as if they somehow deserve to be accepted back by the white community. And they get very offended if a white man doesn't want to be with them due to their support of anti-white black criminals. America is currently in a time of war - it is a Race War, that blacks are waging against Whites. Blacks murder, rape and assault innocent Whites by the millions and laugh about it. And you have supported and endorsed all of this. 

You white girls: You have betrayed your own race. No, wait - you haven't - because you are not White. You no longer deserve to be called a member of the White race anymore. Basically, you are one of THEM now - you are now a lightskinned black girl. You don't deserve to live in a White neighborhood, you don't deserve to be allowed to use the same public bathroom that White women use, and you don't deserve to live in America or any other country that rightfully belongs to White people. You should be forcibly relocated to Africa and forced to spend the rest of your life there. 

Please, white men: have some respect for yourselves, and your race, and refuse to be with or be around these white girls. In my opinion, white males should not date, marry, have sex with or even be friends with white females that have had sex with black males. I'll go even further, and say that white females that have sex with blacks shouldn't even be ALLOWED to date white males again. Any white female that has sex with a black male is announcing to the world that she condones black-on-white crime. Truly, we in America are currently in a race war of black against white, and you can either be on the side of white people, or you are putting yourself on the side of blacks, against white people. When a white female has sex with black males, she is announcing to the world that she supports, condones, and endorses black-on-white hate crimes. These white whores are basically shouting ""black boys are superior to white men and all white people in general, I hope black males rape, rob, murder and assault white people and I will reward these black males with sexual favors for doing so."" White females that have sex with blacks are loyal to black thugs that murder/rape/assault white people, and they shouldn't be allowed to be with white men ever again. Spread the word.

75,djdl7em,"&gt;""No men are just convicted more often because a variety of factors""

Except men don't face the same systemic racism that black people do, but A for effort. 

&gt;There is bias against blacks but they do still commit more violent crime and it isn't close

No they don't, feel free to go read some Michelle Alexander and you'll find out why.

&gt;but Asians

Dude what is your deal with Asian **people**? 

&gt;(females, elderly and even elderly black females) also receive less police attention but that's probably just a coincidence.

The studies that I've seen don't differentiate between gender, but seeing as black women are still black, I highly doubt that they get pulled over at the same rate as white people. Beyond policing, black girls are 6X more likely to be suspended or expelled from school than white girls for the same behavior. Black women are also less likely to get hired for jobs and are more likely to face backlash at school or work for their hair. One can surmise from this information that black women face the same social obstacles that black men do, and thus likely face the same discriminatory attitudes from police. 

Also, most of the crime studies that you're likely looking at don't separate by gender, so it's not really possible to say that anything is coincidental."
76,fxxgzt8,You really don't understand racism if that's what you think. It is a racial insult. Black women were called the mules of the earth. Able to take anything. During slavery white doctors practiced techniques on black women without anesthetic because aparently black women don't feel pain. Even today black women are ignored by doctors who complain of pain because of the deeply ingrained racist belief that black women don't feel pain like whites. It's where the strong black woman trope comes from. Both black girls and black boys are seen as adults (and at the very least much older than they are) which greatly puts then at risk of abuse and lack of sympathy from others. The strong black woman is literally a 'joke' we see played out on TV and comedy all the time.
77,fyerlj6,"&gt;Booker's friends all gave conflicting and disjointed accounts.

Really‽ What were the conflicting (and disjointed) components?

&gt;The other group, including juviniles, all told the exact same story.

This isn't true. For instance, look at how they claim the fight started. Some of them said that it started when Booker and Purdy were arguing about something and the lady was nowhere in sight. Other said it happened when Booker was arguing with the lady up close and Purdy tried to step in between. Those are totally different stories where the only similarity is that they claim they didn't start it.

&gt;No ""noose"", no ""rope"", no ""white power"",

According to their own testimony, yes they deny they said such things. Now that they have a lawyer they're claiming they said ""abuse of power"" because he said he was a County Commissioner. That's convenient. Or maybe Booker tried to set them up by saying he was a county commissioner! Damn sneaky black people, or to paraphrase one of them ""you black boys are the ones always starting things"". They don't sound racist at all. But it's ok, they called him boy before. And commented on his hair in a racist way. Oh and there's a confederate flag. Damn black people making white people act racist! /s

&gt;several confirmed injuries inflicted by Booker

There was a slightly bruised eye and a scratch on Cox. Purdy didn't have anything documented there.

&gt;while his own claimed injuries aren't actually supported by the investigation.

You mean by their initial DNR report that was dismissive? They did document minor injuries but they didn't write anything about his hair being pulled out in the report. They also didn't document anything about Purdy being injured so I guess by that standard Purdy is lying, yet you argue otherwise. So odd... My guess is the DNR didn't play with his hair and try to see. He likely claimed he had a concussion and had some hair pulled after going home and going to a doctor.

&gt; Booker and his people

Not everyone who was a witness who agreed with his story was someone who he knew before. They were people that his friend got to come and help. But the other group was a group of friends.

&gt;are all smarmy and uncooperative toward DNR

DNR was focused on alleged trespassing, even though the only evidence for trespassing were claims from drunk people with inconsistent stories of how Booker started a fight and then somehow (they don't remember how) they got him pinned up against a tree on public land. In other words we have solid evidence of assault on video against one of the people videoing them yet the DNR was focusing on a nonviolent offense with no reliable evidence. I would be annoyed.

&gt;and several of his friends admit to telling him not to go back over

That seems like decent advice. I would doubt he's gonna go over and convince a bunch of belligerent racists to stop being that.

&gt;and start a fight because they know he likes instigating things. 

He likes to start physical altercations? Otherwise this statement means nothing. Words don't typically excuse violence.

&gt;Welcome to activist prosecutions. DNR recommended charges all around, 

False. DNR for some reason released potential charges depending on what evidence you want to rely on. It's an easy way for them to muddy the waters since they were being attacked for not arresting the Purdy group that night."
78,fzeckfr,"The thing is that trauma is involved so while some prostituted persons may express agency and even pride in “choosing to work in the ‘sex industry’, the truth is, if given access to basic needs such as housing, food, emotional and physical safety, etc-they would not choose to do so. A good example is within a relationship: a person would not be expected to perform sex acts for hours a day against his/her will. Yet in prostitution, a person is selling their body and choice to a another. It’s a transaction of power (person with money and/or person selling the person)  look into the ACES score, an assessment of past trauma and the  Equality Model. The people profiting off prostituted and often trafficked persons are lobbying hard for decriminalization of the entire transaction and ALL the actors: pimp, John,  and prostituted persons. But research shows that state sponsored prostitution and trafficking in persons does not protect the prostituted person. I firmly believe the Equality model provides a trauma-informed solution and protection for prostituted persons. It advocates for decriminalization of acts committed under force, fraud, or coercion. It seeks to punish and deter sellers (pimps) and purchasers (Johns) and seeks to overturn prostitution charges levied against the prostituted person.  There is a LOT of money spent on lobbying for the so-called “sex industry”  and the people used as spokespersons do not speak for the majority of people forced or coerced into selling their bodies for money, housing, and basic needs. It’s no different than a pimp having a “bottom bitch” to speak for and express the benevolence of their pimp to the others in order to gain favor within the structure. There’s a a great deal of racism involved  [according to the US Dept. of Justice ](http://demoiselle2femme.org/wp-content/uploads/Human-Trafficking-Black-Girls-are-Still-Enslaved.pdf)  62% of sex trafficking victims are African American. One of the markers for prostituted and or trafficked persons is having a high ACES score. This demonstrates the predatory nature and abuse of power necessary to purchase and use a human being."
79,fuoz86k,"Surely, I thought, when Harry Enfield came on the Radio 4 Today programme, you won’t defend “blackface”. Not you, a pioneer of 1980s “alternative comedy”, forged in defiance of the hateful Bernard Manning “P***” and mother-in-law gag circuit. But as his fans chewed their fists, Enfield justified playing Nelson Mandela as a drug dealer. His blackface was “so wrong it was right”, he said, not racist like an old musical turn, the “Chocolate Coloured C**n”.

Culture is quicksilver. People resplendent on progressive thrones can find themselves abruptly unseated. As this week has shown, dumb decisions can be made, items on no political to-do list, like removal of a beloved episode of Fawlty Towers. Still it is remarkable that a stand-up of Harry Enfield’s calibre has forgotten how to read the room.

Those of us from his generation who attended Rock Against Racism gigs and as students confronted National Front boot-boys in the streets feel indignant when our anti-racist credentials are challenged. But those with teenage or twentysomething kids are used to it. For the young, whatever their race, Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a defining cause. They feel it in their guts, they see injustice with clear, unjaded eyes.

Uncomfortable conversations are happening in locked-down homes. You let slaveowner statues stand in city squares? You ate your sandwich on a bench next to a man who profited from kidnapped black bodies being tipped into the sea? And we must say, yes we did. That mainly we didn’t think too hard about the source of what history lessons called Britain’s “mercantile wealth”. The Royal African Company wasn’t even a footnote.

My generation, even those raised in inner cities, lived mainly in racial bubbles. Today’s young are citizens of a diverse Britain, more likely to have a friend of another race. For white teenagers now, descendants of slaves sit next to them in class, score for their football team. The ever-changing correct terminology which makes older eyes roll is, for the young, just rules by which everyone can rub along. To them George Floyd’s murder is personal, not a remote US crime.

It isn’t a Maoist re-education camp exercise to ask yourself what judgments you made, what remarks you let pass, the indignities small and large you never guessed. I read young black Sunday Times journalist Shingi Mararike recount how he was searched as a thief while trying to buy spinach in a supermarket. White folk furious at police stopping them for tiny lockdown infractions had a small dose of black people’s lives.

Dismiss young BLM protesters as “virtue signallers” and you ignore a historical truth: this is a change generation, such as hasn’t come around since the late-1960s. It will smash up shibboleths and statues. It is educated yet socially excluded, burdened with student debt and unable to buy a home. Conditions are perfect: with shops, bars and clubs closed, the only thing left is to protest. Until lockdown rules changed today, even sex was banned.
After Covid, 18 to 24-year-olds are the age group most likely to be out of work. They have nothing to lose.

These past few weeks remind me of when the #metoo movement began: women over 40 were startled by its righteous force. What a fuss young women made about a hand on the knee. Tell him to eff off, stop making a big deal. Soon, however, we asked why we’d put up with so much. Especially when #metoo’s unblinking spotlight allowed those drugged by Bill Cosby or ruined by Harvey Weinstein, plus countless others, to finally seek justice.

You shouldn’t have tolerated this, younger women said. True, second-wave feminists agreed, yet you celebrate porn and prostitution which is industrialised sexual abuse? Now daughters wonder why JK Rowling cares about boring biology when gender identity is all. Maybe, reply their mothers, the burdens of sex aren’t so apparent until you’re older: you’ll see. Sometimes there is understanding and dialogue, but too often just rage.

“Don’t stand in the doorway,” wrote Bob Dylan of those impeding 1960s progress. “Don’t block up the hall.” No, but we still need to talk. From Sadiq Khan talking of “clear-cut” cases of statues which should go, by the week’s end Baden-Powell is guarded, Churchill is boarded up. Now the far right, which will also find fertile soil in the coming recession, threatens statues of Mandela or Gandhi. One of the Jamaican poet Alfred Fagon is already defaced. A culture war threatens to become a street battle. (Which is what a nihilist minority on each side want.)

British people agree Edward Colston should go, but only 13 per cent support how his effigy was ripped down. This is a cautious country, which will be guided towards racial justice but not if the only way it is permitted to see its history is through a lens of shame. A backlash could lead to a repurposing of the clapped-out Brexit Party and give Nigel Farage a new job. It will be Sir Keir Starmer’s greatest challenge to promote BLM’s objectives without alienating northern and Midlands voters that Labour needs to win back.

Instead this youthful fire needs to be put under institutions, not old sitcoms. To ask why so many black boys are excluded from school only to end up in jail. To address why black people in sundry situations, from the army to boarding schools, are now revealing concealed abuse. BLM cannot turn into an angry balloon debate about which historical figure was worst.

This year has shown us that progress can happen in unexpected convulsions. The point is not to close our minds, to think only our generation’s ways will do. No, Harry Enfield should not be “cancelled”, but blackface must."
80,ftexzg2,"I found a thought-provoking post about use of imagery of young black girls by the BLM movement, last night on facebook (with accompanying screenshots of the imagery in question):

&gt; These protesters and propagandists, continue to put black girls in danger and it must end immediately. They are using black girls to not only make a statement but also as human shields and even in drawings, cartoons and videos. 

&gt; ...

&gt; Using these little black girls as objects for the black patriarchy, placing them in harm's way and having no regard for their feelings or their fears is unconscionable and unacceptable. Far too many of these misogynistic black males harm, neglect and sexually abuse these little girls as well as their mothers, daily. Where is the outcry about THAT behavior in these discussions about black survival? Now they have the nerve to put these little girls front and center as a way to validate their male centered politics? It's nothing short of exploitation. 

&gt; ...

&gt; These black girls should be at home. Not out on the streets protesting. Not only should they not be in the middle of a crowd, with a pandemic going on, risking their health but they should be shielded from harm by being cared for at home and allowed to enjoy being little girls. They certainly should not be out there being trained to be race soldiers and handmaidens for the black patriarchy.. A group who completely overlooks the plight they will face as they grow up in black communities, where black girls are regularly abused and where the concerns of black women and girls are constantly ignored, marginalized and viewed as an afterthought. 

&gt; ...

&gt; These little black girls they are waving around like banners in these protests will eventually become the black teen girls and young women black males and the rest of society call bitches and hoes when they get older. They will be the same black women that these black males will dog, demean and degrade on line and put down if they become single parents. The same ""angry black woman"" stereotype will follow them as they are passed over for other races of women because they are deemed as ""not feminine enough"". They will also be the same black women whose rights are overlooked when black communities rally around the killing of black males, while thousands of black women and girls remain murdered or missing.

The original post is public and posted June 5th, it's by a woman Ree Walker who I think is definitely worth a read. I'm excerpting parts of it here and giving the reference to hopefully get it some more exposure. She pokes at a lot of good stuff.

Tangentially related to that, just reading around various discussions related to the protests this week, and having read various discussions previously about the Black Lives Matter movement (as an organized movement) and recognizing that it was started by WOMEN and yet tends to give women the short shrift in it now (like so many other social justice movements with men in them, imagine that!) and realizing that I don't actually agree with all of the official movement goals, even though they're doing some good stuff, it just kinda strikes me that in this era of hashtags, it's easy to be misunderstood.

I think ""Black Lives Matter"" as a general statement is a great statement which I whole-heartedly support, but the actual organization I'm not as sanguine about, so it kinda makes me hesitant to just use the hashtag lest it seem I support the specific political body 100%.  

Also sadly yes I agree with others here that violence against women (of any background, but particularly black women in this particular discussion) is so normalized that people don't even see the problem.  Also hell yeah to the whole ""being seen as mothers/sisters of victims, only"" thing.  The use of the little black girls mentioned in Walker's post gets at that too, only in that case it's ""daughters of victims.""

Appreciate the discussion."
81,ftgzrnm,"Half of black girls are raped by black men. Oprah Winfried spoke often about how, as a little child of color, she was repeated abused and raped by black men.

Oprah said she used that horrible childhood to purpose and, like any empowered black woman would do living in America, she learned early to blame her abuse on white society. Oprah then turned her self loathing into white hot hatred for white men and that hatred made her a billionaire.

This is something we see played out millions of times with single mothers on welfare even if all they produce are of millions of dysfunctional low IQ children with an innate urge to riot and loot."
82,fxcbe2u,"&gt;Wait what? It totally does. It in inherently racist to generalize about an entire racial group based on your limited experience.

I fundamentally disagree.  Saying ""I don't want to date a black girl because every black girl I've ever met was a hoodrat"" is not a racist statement.  Saying ""white guys shouldn't date black girls because all black girls are hoodrats"" is a racist statement.  The difference is subtle but it should not be overlooked.  The former statement asserts a preference based on an individualized and subjective value system.  The latter asserts that an entire group is objectively inferior to another group based on a stereotype.  There *IS* a difference.  This young man holds certain qualities in high esteem and his experiences with young black women have taught him that they do not typically possess said qualities or that they generally possess the opposite qualities.  Not wanting to actively invest the time to get to know somebody on the off chance that they are different is not racism.  It's just a risk vs. reward computation.  Why start dating somebody who is, based on your lived experience, considerably less likely to check all of your boxes?  By the way, how do you think the fact that she's black even came up?  Assuming they've never met before I very much doubt that she said ""you should go out with my friend, she's really sweet"" and he responded with ""is she black?""  I think it's far more likely that she said ""we need to get you a black girlfriend.""

&gt;Sure, you're allowed to discriminate like that. No one's saying it should be illegal lol. However, if you discriminate against a racial group for racist reasons, then you are probably a racist. It's perfectly reasonable for those in your life to try to convince you to not be racist.

This argument relies upon the idea that he's discriminating for racist reasons which I think I pretty thoroughly debunked in the first part of my response.  So I'm going to move on.

&gt;How is that ""black indoctrination therapy?""

This girl is trying to get him to hang out with black people, date black people, go to BLM protests and so on.  How can you look at that and not think it's an indoctrination.  To me, it screams, we need to surround you with all things black.

&gt;Getting in touch with your own heritage is perfectly acceptable behavior. It's natural to pass on your heritage to your children.

Getting in touch with your own heritage IS perfectly acceptable behavior....when you're doing it of your own accord.  But trying to force an identity onto somebody who has no interest in accepting it is basically abuse.  And, by the way, nobody is passing their heritage onto their children here.  Both of the parents here are white.  They both have mixed race children resulting from prior relationships with black people.  The girl still has a relationship with her black father and is more in touch with her ""blackness.""  The boy's mother, who was black, died after giving birth to him and he was raised by his white single father and only has ties to his white family which is why he doesn't really identify as black.  I know reading comprehension is hard but try to keep up."
83,fxcrh9h,"&gt;I fundamentally disagree. Saying ""I don't want to date a black girl because every black girl I've ever met was a hoodrat"" is not a racist statement. Saying ""white guys shouldn't date black girls because all black girls are hoodrats"" is a racist statement. The difference is subtle but it should not be overlooked. 

Both statements are racist because both generalize about a racial group.  Either way, you're saying that black girls tend to be ""ghetto"" or ""hood rats,"" which is a generalization about a racial group and is thus racist.  It doesn't matter if you're prescribing action to only yourself or to everyone; it's racist either way because both statements involve the racist generalization that all black girls are ""ghetto.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The former statement asserts a preference based on an individualized and subjective value system. The latter asserts that an entire group is objectively inferior to another group based on a stereotype. There *IS* a difference.

Why start dating somebody who is, based on your lived experience, considerably less likely to check all of your boxes? 

The racism is in assuming that ""young black women...do not typically possess said qualities...""  That is the essence of racism.  Generalizing about a racial group is racist.  I don't know how else to say it.  It doesn't matter if you do it individually; it is still racist to generalize about racial groups.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;By the way, how do you think the fact that she's black even came up?

I think it's far more likely that she said ""we need to get you a black girlfriend.""

I think the post makes it pretty clear that the daughter tried to set him up with a friend who happened to be black, to which he responded that he doesn't date black girls.  It does not appear anyone was trying to force him to date a black girl.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This argument relies upon the idea that he's discriminating for racist reasons which I think I pretty thoroughly debunked in the first part of my response. So I'm going to move on.

You definitely did not.  Generalizing based on race IS racist even if you're only intending to personally act on that conclusion.

You haven't explained how it's indoctrination.  Encouraging someone to get in touch with their heritage is not indoctrination.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Getting in touch with your own heritage IS perfectly acceptable behavior....when you're doing it of your own accord. But trying to force an identity onto somebody who has no interest in accepting it is basically abuse. 

No one's forcing him to do anything; they're encouraging him because they want to help him.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And, by the way, nobody is passing their heritage onto their children here. Both of the parents here are white.

The daughter's dad passed on his heritage to her, and now she's trying to share it.  Heritage is still being passed on and shared here."
84,flb2y21,"I'm white and married to a black man, and this is something that frustrates my husband and makes him feel ashamed as well. We're willing to talk about how black girls are extremely vulnerable to sexual abuse, but we're not allowed to talk about who is raping them. He doesn't get how people can be so blind to this. It's so obvious. 

As a matter of fact, while progressives are (rightfully) worried about anti-Asian attacks in this Covid-19 crisis, they can't say that it's almost exclusively black men who have attacked people. I was scrolling through Twitter recently where Asians in the West were admitting that while they got plenty of shitty comments from whites, they only ever were physically attacked from black men. Rap culture has done terrible harm to the black community, and it poisons young men the way porn does. So much of it is anti-woman propaganda. Anti-black woman in particular, every woman in general."
85,fjaifbc,"P r e a c h. Even when things like wealth and socioeconomic backgrounds are controlled for, black women still have higher mortality rates during childbirth. This is a really important point because racists or even people who are clueless but have good intentions might try to blame this phenomenon on disparities in wealth, but that simply isn’t true. Black girls are also hyper sexualized at a young age and black boys are treated more aggressively for the same things a non black kid would do. Black women are also struggling because of the fatherlessness issue in the black community. Instead of encouraging HEALTHY masculinity and paternalism, we are encouraging men to cut off their penises and run from their problems. Then we shame women for not accepting their transitioning spouses who subject them to emotional and sometimes physical abuse. Black women get the short end of the stick in so many ways. I’m so sorry."
86,feixj47,"Hi! My theories:
Black mommy- he loves you and sees you as a mommy figure. He wishes you were his mommy and could stay at his house longer each day. You’re fun! 

Penis talk: he probably had an erection at some point and it’s confusing for him. (I’ve seen babies have them, it’s not that unusual for his age)

I would just be matter the fact. “Black girls ARE nice, aren’t they?/ are you missing your mommy today?” “Do you think you’re getting stronger all over?/ our bodies do get stronger when we get bigger” 

You might want to give dad a heads up that he’s curious about his private parts so he can control the narrative if he wants. (I know some parents don’t want us going anywhere near the subjects of sex) Also , I am NOT being accusatory of his dad, but whenever a child comments to me about private parts I keep my antennae up about possible abuse JUST IN CASE as it’s common for abuse victims to model behavior done to them. It’s probably perfectly innocent, but it doesn’t hurt to be aware of signs. I’ve just heard too many stories about kids behavior/comments being overlooked when abused so it’s an Issue for me."
87,fc6hj7d,"Black love (as it exist in the cis hetro spher) is a baby that needs to be thrown out with the bath water. Literally since the end of slavery black men have made it their mission to impart the message to black women that we are to be utilized not cared for. Fredrick Dougless? Abandoned his wife and child for a white abolitionist. George Jackson? Huey Freeman? Ever read any of their books or manifestos? They literally explain that the “pro-black” movements in which they were involved were only pro black men. Despite all of this little black girls are still socialized to be a stepping stone for black male success.

“Black love” for what? To live a life full of abuse, humiliation and powerlessness? If white women want to adopt black and their struggle love bullshit, let them. There are plenty of white, asian, hispanic, ect.. that will treat you well."

Its frequently white girl black dude. If its white on white, the white guy is an evil monster who abuse or dump her. Or at best a moron.

Women tend to date men that seem socially acceptable as partner. Hence, quite a bit of white girl date black guy. Add to that the racist stereotype of the size, the impression of doing something anti racist, and you have got trends.


Now, when you are picturing a black girl, what do you picture in your head ? The brown fox type ? That went away with the 70s.

There are few sexy cultural images of black girl, even less than positive images of white men, and hence, black girls are seen with lower interest.

Yes, it suck for them. Probably as much as for ordinary men."
89,f9ojce2,"""An estimated 30% of black boys is sexually assaulted before 18""

60% of black girls are sexually assaulted before 18. 

And stats on physical abuse seem scarce but from limited research it seems black children are more likely to be assaulted, seriously injured or killed by a family member than by the police or a neighborhood watchman. Yearly statistics consistently show that black children are mistreated and killed at significantly higher rates than white and Latino children  

So no, boys alone don't have the highest rates of abuse.

I don't know what she's trying to say here or who ""ya'll"" is but it really sounds like she's conflating two completely unrelated things. 

Yes, sexual abuse of boys is an issue but she's making it out to seem like whoever ""yall"" is doesn't have a legitimate point.  Experiencing hardship doesn't erase lopsided gendered expectations and privileges that boys (regardless of race) are often afforded in the home. It has real world impacts.

I don't get why the concept of experiencing privilege and oppression simultaneously has to keep being explained"
90,fa78okh,"I got into an argument with a white woman here where she insisted that telling all girl children they’re pretty is bad. I pointed out that most black girls are never told they’re beautiful and we live in a society that demeans black women from our hair down to our vaginas. By all means don’t tell little white girls they’re pretty but little black girls need to hear it. I eventually had to block her because she accused me of ‘identity politics’. 

Yes I’ve seen racism, insensitivity and tone-deafness on this board. Many white women including radical feminists believe that their experience is universal when that’s so not the case. Intersectionality, despite it’s abuse by the transcult is a thing that exists and accusing us of ‘identity politics’ doesn’t help. My life is and experiences are real and in many ways different from yours. Refusal to acknowledge that fact pushes black women away."
91,fa93ymw,"&gt;This makes me want to make a different thread asking about ableism in this sub, and radical feminism in general.  
&gt;  
&gt;For example, my experience is very much out of the norm for someone from my background. I'm white, and my parents are middle-class. My parents also don't help me at all; when I was a child, they were neglectful when it came to, say, issues of me being abused by men, so I just learned, at an extremely young age, never to tell them anything. They also made me feel I was bad and wrong because I was a naughty tomboy and not obedient, feminine, or pleasing enough (my dad especially did this). They have issues about ""independence"" though...I've been on my own since I was seventeen. They have always made it clear they'd never give any of us money (and at this point in their lives, they're quite well off). The recession made no difference to them in this regard. All of us went into debt for college, and got scholarships for graduate school, and in spite of our level of education and intelligence had trouble finding work due to the recession, which hit the same year I graduated with my BA (my dad, for example, was far less qualified than I when he got a tenure-track position at a college that now pays poverty wages, employs over ninety percent adjuncts and would never hire me in a million years; the world has totally changed in 25 years). Four years ago I was raped and contracted acute PTSD, and my parents refused to help me in any way. I had to fight for my own healthcare, on Medicaid, and work three jobs with extreme PTSD, while my attacker continued to torment me in the community. My psychiatrist recently asked me about my relationship with my parents, and when I mentioned how they failed to protect us from child molesters when we were little, made me feel bad about myself, and refused to help me in any way when I contracted PTSD, he said ""suddenly this""--- waves hand in my general direction-- ""makes a lot more sense."" His question made me cry.  
&gt;  
&gt;Weirdly, I still love my parents, and they purport to love me? I brought my boyfriend to Thanksgiving, and did a lot of the cooking and cleanup, and then we brought them scones for tea the next day. Regardless, I am leaving town and not looking back, and if I end up having kids I will feel extremely reluctant to bring them by. I don't feel like my parents have really earned a lot of grandchildren privilege, to be honest. It's hard for me to let go how hurt I am about their refusal to help me in any way, despite it being absolutely no hardship for them, when I had a major disorder which destroyed my health and could have killed me...even if I forgive them for all the childhood stuff, that alone is incredibly hurtful, especially as I turned down a great job in another country to move back to my hometown and be closer to them, since they're getting older, and it was shortly after that I was abused and developed PTSD. I had to work three jobs the whole time, while suffering from constant nightmares, panic attacks, and flashbacks...I am lucky I was able to do this at all. I could have easily ended up in the hospital or on the street, or dead-- I had to constantly remind myself not to kill myself- so it was very hurtful.  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyway, my experience is unusual, since I'm white and from a middle-class background, which I suppose is why even my psychiatrist was confused as to why I'd experienced all this abuse and was on Medicaid. Sorry for the long tangent about my parents, it hurts to even write about it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyway, I am not sure if it's because of this I developed various mental illnesses, or if my experience just exacerbated a genetic tendency that runs on my dad's side of the family, but definitely having bipolar 2, and C-PTSD/depression/anxiety made me much more vulnerable to male sexual predation and to domestic violence, and in general the sexism I have suffered, from employers, partners, men on the street, doctors, etc., has been compounded by if not outright caused by the fact that I have mental illness...it is absolutely inextricable from my mental problems. Since contracting major PTSD, I have been treated absolutely horribly, mainly by men but also by other women, including on this sub. I am fortunately a lot better now, thanks mostly to my own efforts.  
&gt;  
&gt;My disability is invisible (except to predators, who spot it right away), which means that people don't really believe me, and I am often assumed to be privileged, which hurts...I don't think we should ever assume that about any women (really, about anyone, but certainly not about anyone from an oppressed group). I can sympathize with how another axis of oppression/discrimination leads to a very specific experience of sexism that those who are not, say, black and female, or mentally ill and female, do not experience.  
&gt;  
&gt;This sub is absolutely rife with ableism too. Women calling trans people ""mentally ill,"" in a pejorative sense, are never shut down. The fact is, we should be calling for a civil rights movement for the mentally ill; the whole reason trans people seek to dissociate themselves from the label is because of the heavy stigma against neurodivergence. I don't think we should even call it ""mental illness,"" we should call it ""neurodivergence;"" for the most part it's a way of being different in the world, it's worsened by stigma and discrimination, and people who are different need support, not discrimination. This sub's whole approach to the trans question is so ableist it makes me want to tear my hair out most of the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;I also see casually ableist language here all the time. I spot racism here all the time, too, from white women weaponizing black female oppression or making inappropriate comparisons (and I have been guilty of this, too) to straight-up racist stereotyping or hateful racism against black women, Latina women, and Jewish women.  
&gt;  
&gt;I do think we need to call it out wherever we see it. AND everyone here needs to understand that a  black woman's experience of sexism IS SHAPED BY BEING BLACK, just as a neurodivergent woman's experience of sexism IS SHAPED BY HER EXPERIENCE OF MENTAL DIFFERENCE AS WELL. Radfems really need to stop throwing babies out with bathwater. Intersectionality is the best thing about liberal feminism, an incredibly helpful lens through which to view different women's experience, and has nothing to do with the rest of liberal feminism that is shitty AT ALL. And identity politics were stolen from black women campaigning for visibility in the 60's, 70's and 80's, so fuck all the white people who whine about ""idpol"" while knowing approximately jack shit about it.  
&gt;  
&gt;I saw your conversation with the person about how black girls are told they're ugly, so I agree with you they do need to be told they're attractive; similarly, women who are naturally bigger but not necessarily unhealthy are also told they're ugly, which is why body positivity is good, as long as it doesn't veer into the territory of objectification. I think black girls and women tend to get hypersexualized by society too, so I feel like this message that dark skin is beautiful, natural hair is beautiful, and they are gorgeous as they are should come along with the disclaimer that they don't NEED to be gorgeous for men, and that their sexuality, like that of all women, is their own and no one else's...just my two cents; I hope I'm not speaking out of turn.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sorry for the rest of that rant, I've had a stressful day. /endrant"
92,f3u9bdv,"I understand femininity is used to oppress women but, what I am saying is heterosexual masculinity is used to oppress gay men. I am not talking about misandry in terms of gender or sexuality, I am talking about hating men, period. I am talking about biological males being hated for not expressing a socially acceptable male being in terms of heterosexual culture. 

For example, a woman isn't gonna be ostracized for liking high heels and make up, but a gay men or an effeminate man will. In my sex centric view, gender abolishing view, it is because he is a man liking high heels, not because he is feminine. Because centuries ago, liking high heels and make up was a suitable thing for a man to wear and like. 

In terms of gender, I can understand your argument, but I consider it flimsy because gender norms will continually change, but there are only two sexes. 

And I don't agree that femininity is hated universally. Femininity is desired in women and women are oppressed because of it. Anytime a woman is behaving ""masculine"" she is liable to be called angry, bitter, and a bitch. A woman acting feminine is considered proper etiquette.

Black girls are considered more masculine and they get expelled and disciplined more than White girls, who are considered more feminine. 

Westerner men travel to South America and Asia for sex and companionship because they believe the Latinas and Asian women are more feminine than Western women. Men treat women poorly because they desire femininity to the point they abuse women to keep it that way. 

No difference than a White slave owners treating Blacks poorly because they want Blacks to stay slaves. Men hate women because the things men feel like they have to do to have women. Men accept women on certain terms.


White slaveowners desired slaves so they treated them bad so they can stay slaves. White Americans accepted Black people on certain terms. There were no terms where Jews and other undesirables were accepted in Nazi Germany. 

There are no terms in heterosexual culture, where gay men are accepted.

Feminine men and gay men are treated poorly by heterosexual men and women because it is not desired or accepted. Women are treated poorly by men because they are desired and are accepted by male society on certain terms.

In my view, gays are hated because they are men. Because their desire for men would be accepted if they were women. Feminine gays would be accepted if they were women and in fact, Iran accepts and desire trans-women because in their mind, they are women, but they do not want gay men.

I just don't see how this issue ultimately does not come down to sex and not gender."
93,eyu7qv4,"Yeah that cause black girls are believed to mature quicker and to be, some how, ready and willing for sexual experience as soon as they start to grow.

Even worse, most of that is due to family men sexually abusing the girls, since sexual promiscuity is linked to early childhood abuse"
94,ekvtm6b,"&gt;I understand that, but that doesn't mean that *you* get to decide that no radfem can criticize a non-white culture unless she is part of it. I'm not talking about the ""racist ones"", I don't consider those feminists. To be honest, I don't care about the jokes that are made about ""brown men"", they don't need a defense squad. I'll start defending the ""prejudice"" brown men face, the day that they collectively quit being so obsessed with perpetuating sexism, and actually start to rectify the damage they've done to their own communities.

Actually yes, women of color are allowed to say to white women that those women are hurting them. People who have had a history of abuse are allowed to speak out against their abuser. Also I never said no radfem can criticize a non-white culture, I even said multiple times that I don't have any issue with Western women discussing what's going on in Brunei. I'm just saying that brown women should be the forefront of the movement but we're often cast to the side. And that we get spoken over as opposed to listened to. A lot of radfems get their sources from white nationalist sites (I've seen this firsthand) so naturally the things they say about Islam are wrong sometimes but whenever ex-Muslim women try to correct them we're just 'brainwashed' and defending 'our faith'. They refuse to believe that most of us are actually atheists.

As for Judaism, imagine me as an ex-Muslim woman who's been affected by anti-Jewish propaganda from her own people creating a blog in which I only cherry pick the crimes that Jewish men commit and mainly only Jewish men. This will of course make Jewish women wary and it's the same for ex-Muslim women who call out blogs dedicated to criticizing only Muslim men. 

&gt;I'm not saying ""let white women be racist"", I'm saying ""let white women criticize sexism within my culture, so I don't have to do it all alone, because if I need to wait for my fellow arab women to do so, I can wait for the next hundred years because we literally face violence from our own families for criticizing Islamic culture.'

I think this is a very backwards and racist statement. Not all Eastern women live in extremist villages and face stoning or hanging for speaking out. I've criticized Eastern misogyny + Islam and so have thousands of other women. Ex-Muslim women speak out regularly against Islam so your statement that we have to wait for white women to speak up for 'voiceless' Muslim women is extremely racist and untrue. Sure there are some who DO face violence, say in Iran, but women in more lenient Muslim countries who have left Islam without violence can and often do speak up for those women. 

&gt;To be honest, I don't care about the jokes that are made about ""brown men"", they don't need a defense squad. I'll start defending the ""prejudice"" brown men face, the day that they collectively quit being so obsessed with perpetuating sexism, and actually start to rectify the damage they've done to their own communities.

Actually yes they absolutely do, a little Muslim boy was killed because of Islamophobia by virtue of being in the mosque at Christchurch. When you paint all brown men as evil due to the actions of extremist brown men as Western radfems do it leads to non-radical brown men (some who don't even practice Islam) getting killed or bullied. Your logic is that we don't need to defend prejudice because MoC can perpetuate sexism. By that logic I shouldn't care when little black boys are shot by cops, or [when a Latin guy in the US got choked to death by a racist white guy in front of his own daughter](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/us/houston-cop-choke.html), or [when Indian convenience store owners trying to support their wives and daughters get shot to death by white supremacists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/12/police-man-started-dumpster-fire-to-run-the-arabs-out-of-our-country-the-victims-were-indian/)."
95,ekvzls6,"&gt;Actually yes, women of color are allowed to say to white women that those women are hurting them. People who have had a history of abuse are allowed to speak out against their abuser. 
Yes, they definitely are! I'm saying that women of color aren't allowed to tell other women of color what to do. As in, if I want to have a discussion on these issues with a white radfem, other women of color shouldn't be allowed to tell me off for it. If I want to discuss sexism in muslim communities, I want to do so without receiving censorship from white liberals, or ex-muslims who think we need to only discuss these issues between ourselves. I actually get to have a voice on these issues as well as a MENA woman. 
Feel free to speak out against white women. I never said you shouldn't. I also speak up when I notice racism, why wouldn't I.
&gt; Also I never said no radfem can criticize a non-white culture, I even said multiple times that I don't have any issue with Western women discussing what's going on in Brunei. 
Yes, we agree here. 
&gt; I'm just saying that brown women should be the forefront of the movement but we're often cast to the side. And that we get spoken over as opposed to listened to.
I fully agree that brown women should be at the forefront of the movement. I'm a brown woman too, I'd never put myself at the back. I'm not arguing about that. I'm saying that I also want the support of white radfems when it comes to these issues, and I don't want the focus to only be on white problems. 
&gt; A lot of radfems get their sources from white nationalist sites (I've seen this firsthand) so naturally the things they say about Islam are wrong sometimes but whenever ex-Muslim women try to correct them we're just 'brainwashed' and defending 'our faith'. They refuse to believe that most of us are actually atheists.
I know what you mean in temrs of white nationalist sites- but honestly, even as a brown woman, I sometimes have to resort to getting my news from there because right-wing sources are the only ones who are allowed to criticize certain sexist practices anymore (unrelated to race!). Left-wing news stations have been completely silenced on these matters. We must find better sources, I agree with that. 
Can I have an example of the ""wrong things they say about Islam""? Because I feel like there are disagreements about Islam even among ex-muslim feminists. Like, I have witnessed what you mention, but I have also witnessed ex-muslims defending the very faith they left. 
&gt; As for Judaism, imagine me as an ex-Muslim woman who's been affected by anti-Jewish propaganda from her own people creating a blog in which I only cherry pick the crimes that Jewish men commit and mainly only Jewish men. This will of course make Jewish women wary and it's the same for ex-Muslim women who call out blogs dedicated to criticizing only Muslim men.
Well of course, that is antisemetic. But that's not the same thing as a woman criticizing sexism in every culture, and one of those cultures being one that's heavily influenced by Judaism. I'm not in favor of feminism that only targets men of óne race or óne culture. It's ridiculous to expect women to only criticize sexism that comes from white, christian men. I never said who should be cherry picking either, of course I disagree with that. 
&gt; I think this is a very backwards and racist statement. Not all Eastern women live in extremist villages and face stoning or hanging for speaking out.
It really isn't. I'm not being racist towards myself here, lmao. It's just a statement that doesn't hold true for your own location- which is precisely my point. We don't all have the same experiences, we are not a monolith. 
Yes, I'm an atheist MENA woman who lives in Belgium, a very liberal western country. And yet, if I am caught speaking this way about Islamic culture, I will probably get a beating from some angry muslim men who overhear me. If I tell my very modern muslim friends who go to university with me for STEM majors that I'm a lesbian, I'll probably be ocstracized and have rumours spread about me. I know an ex-muslim girl who got beaten by her aunt for saying she was doubting her faith- she lives in the Netherlands, a place even more liberal than my own country. 
Not all of us are safe. You don't need to live in an extremist country, for extremist Islamic violence to reach you.  
&gt; I've criticized Eastern misogyny + Islam and so have thousands of other women. Ex-Muslim women speak out regularly against Islam so your statement that we have to wait for white women to speak up for 'voiceless' Muslim women is extremely racist and untrue. 
Did I say that white women should speak up for the ""voiceless""? No. And no, it isn't racist to be honest about the situation in my own environment. I am aware of the thousands of ex-muslim women who speak out against Islam. I am even more aware of the fact that most of them get censored by the media, censored by their own muslim family members, and that there are millions more pro-islam women that drown out their voices. 
I'm not saying ""let white women speak for us"" lmao. 
&gt; Sure there are some who DO face violence, say in Iran, but women in more lenient Muslim countries who have left Islam without violence can and often do speak up for those women.
I live in Belgium, an incredibly liberal country, and yet, here too it is difficult to speak up for these women. Like, you don't need to live in Iran to get violence in response of criticism of Islam. I honestly need to know where exactly you live, because it appears to be an ex-muslim utopia. :/ 
&gt; Actually yes they absolutely do, a little Muslim boy was killed because of Islamophobia by virtue of being in the mosque at Christchurch. When you paint all brown men as evil due to the actions of extremist brown men as Western radfems do it leads to non-radical brown men (some who don't even practice Islam) getting killed or bullied.
Ah yes, #notallbrownmen, and if we criticize brown men, we are in fact causing them bodily harm. That poor boy wasn't murdered by a radical feminist, he was murdered by a crazy male islamophobe. Don't play the ""guilting"" game here. And please don't compare women criticizing sexist brown men, to crazy islamophobic white men who shoot up churches, for fuck's sake. Did his manifesto read like an out-cry for women's rights for you? Is he a radical feminist? Did white women criticizing sexism within Islam cause this man to go mental? No. And you know that. 
&gt; Your logic is that we don't need to defend prejudice because MoC can perpetuate sexism. By that logic I shouldn't care when little black boys are shot by cops, or when a Latin guy in the US got choked to death by a racist white guy in front of his own daughter, or when Indian convenience store owners trying to support their wives and daughters get shot to death by white supremacists.
No, my logic is that *I* should not be pressured into caring about the issues of MoC who perpetuate and cause sexism. Who is talking about little black boys? Or the denial of racist violence in america? Am I not allowed to call out sexist black men for their sexism because they happen to face racism? Why are you comparing wanting to focus on women's rights to supporting white supremacists? Why must I center brown men in feminism? A man attacks another man in a store, and this is my fault for not defending brown men?"
96,ejku5es,"&gt; people are willingly looking over the abuse numbers that are committed by black women. 

Because it takes a special type of ignorance to disprove what they see with their own eyes. DV rates are highest against black women and you don't need data for street harassment or date rape or the fact a higher % of black girls are abused before they are even 18. FOH.


&gt; What do black men have to do with media depiction?

Yeah, as if the depiction of black women by black men in pop culture is something to be bragged about.

You're so insecure Audrey Lorde got you shook. Bye! 😂😂😂"
97,egztvbi,"
&gt;Minorities sure don't like it when white guys try to tell them how they should feel about their situations, and white guys don't like being told we are privileged and don't experience discrimination.

Okay, then how about instead of presuming anything about your specific situation, I'll simply provide data and empirical evidence that points to systemic bias which favors white people. Tell me if any of this looks like privilege...

In New York City, whites comprise 44% of the population; blacks and Latinos, 53%.

Between 2005 and 2008, 80% of NYPD stops were of blacks and Latinos. Only 10% of stops were of whites.

85% of those frisked were black; only 8% were white. (Blacks and Latinos were frisked 50% of the time; whites, only 34%.)

Under the NYPD’s controversial “stop-and-frisk” program, in every year since 2009, 87% of those stopped-and-frisked were black or Latino. 10% were white.

24% of blacks and Latinos had force used against them by the NYPD, compared to only 17% of whites.

Only 2.6% of all stops (1.6 million stops over 3.5 years) resulted in the discovery of contraband or a weapon. Whites were more likely to be found with contraband or a weapon.

Similar trends are seen in Department of Justice data from Los Angeles between July 2003 and June 2004.

The stop rate for blacks was 3,400 stops per 10,000 residents higher than the white stop rate. The Latino stop rate was 360 stops higher.

Blacks were 127% more likely to get frisked and 76% more likely to get searched than whites; Latinos, 43% more likely to get frisked and 16% more likely to get searched.

And yet, frisked blacks were 42% less likely to be found with a weapon than frisked whites; Latinos, 32% less likely.

Consensual searches of blacks were “37 percent less likely to uncover weapons, 23.7 percent less likely to uncover drugs, and 25.4 percent less likely to uncover any other type of contraband, than consensual searches of Whites.”

Consensual searches of Latinos were “32.8 percent less likely to uncover weapons, 34.3 percent less likely to uncover drugs, and 12.3 percent less likely to uncover any other type of contraband than consensual searches of Whites.”

Similar statistics can be seen across the U.S.

A study in Arizona found state highway patrol 3.5 times more likely to search a stopped Native American, and 2.5 times more likely to search a stopped African American or Latino, than a white person. And yet, whites who were searched were more likely than all other groups to be transporting drugs, guns, or other contraband.

A study in West Virginia showed black drivers 1.64 times more likely, and Latinos 1.48 times more likely, to be stopped than white drivers. After being stopped, non-whites were more likely to get arrested, even though police “obtained a significantly higher contraband hit rate for white drivers than minorities.”

In Illinois, data showed the number of consent searches after traffic stops, for blacks and Latinos, to be “more than double that of whites”—even though “white motorists were twice as likely to have contraband”!

Studies in Minnesota and Texas have yielded the same results, with blacks and Latinos being stopped more often, even though whites were more likely to have contraband.

In another study, it was found that blacks are three times more likely to be stopped in California than whites.

A 2007 U.S. Department of Justice report on racial profiling found that blacks and Latinos were 3 times as likely to be stopped as whites, and that blacks were twice as likely to be arrested and 4 times as likely “to experience the threat or use of force during interactions with the police.”

Similar disparities between the practice of racial profiling and actual crime rates can be seen in the “War on Drugs”:

Blacks are less than 13% of the U.S. population, and they make up only 14% of regular drug users, but they are 37% of those arrested for drug offenses, and 56% of those in state prisons for drug offenses.

Black kids are 10 times more likely to be arrested for drug crimes than white kids 

Blacks aged 18-25 are less likely than whites to have used marijuana in the last 12 months

Blacks of all ages are also more likely never to have used marijuana

And yet, black arrest rates for marijuana are astronomically higher—and the disparity is only getting worse
In Seattle in 2002, “African Americans constituted 16% of observed drug dealers for the five most dangerous drugs but 64% of drug dealing arrests for those drugs.”

In the late 1990s, black and white women had similar levels of drug use during pregnancy, but black women were 10 times as likely as white women to be reported to child services for prenatal drug use.


There are currently more black people locked up in prison than there were enslaved in 1850.

1 in every 15 black men (and 1 in every 36 Latino men) are currently incarcerated, while for white men the statistic is 1 in 106.

1 in 3 black men can expect to go to jail at some point in their lifetimes.

Minorities are less than 28% of the U.S. population, but they are nearly 60% of the prison population  This is not simply because black men are committing more crimes—see Poverty, below.

African American juvenile youth is only 16% of the U.S. population, but they are 28% of juvenile arrests, 37% of the youth in juvenile jails, and 58% of the youth sent to adult prisons.

Black boys are five times as likely to go to jail as white boys; Latino boys are 3 times as likely.

Once arrested, blacks are more likely to remain in prison awaiting trial than whites; in some places, they are 33% more likely to be detained while awaiting trial than whites.

Then, people of color are routinely arraigned under stiffer, harsher charges than white offenders. While more than 90% of cases end in a plea bargain, blacks and Latinos are less successful at getting their sentences reduced via plea bargain.

According to a University of Michigan study: “Black defendants face significantly more severe charges than whites even after controlling for criminal behavior (arrest offense, multiple-defendant case structure, and criminal history), observed defendant characteristics (e.g., age, education), defense counsel type, district, county economic characteristics, and crime rates. Unexplained racial disparities exist across the charge- severity distribution, especially at the high end. The most striking disparities are found in the use of charges that carry non-zero statutory minimum sentences.”

Black men are nearly twice as likely to be arraigned on charges that carry a mandatory minimum.

A study in Georgia in the 1980s found that more than 20% of black defendents convicted of murdering white victims received the death penalty. However, only 8% of whites who killed whites and 1% of blacks who killed other blacks received the death penalty.

Blacks are 21% more likely to receive mandatory minimum sentences.

Blacks are 20% more likely to be sentenced to prison than whites.

Once convicted, black offenders receive sentences that are 10% longer than white offenders for the same crimes.

That sentencing gap has widened in recent years; since judicial discretion was returned by the Supreme Court in 2005, “Prison sentences of black men were nearly 20% longer than those of white men for similar crimes in recent years.”

2/3 of criminals receiving life sentences are non-whites; in the state of New York, it’s 83%. 

Meanwhile, a white male with a criminal record is 5% more likely to get a job than an equally qualified person of color with a clean record

According to a study in Canada, non-white women who go missing receive 27 times less media coverage than white women.

While African American children comprise 33.2% of missing children cases, but only 19.5% of cases reported in the media

98,eh2mzjg,"Black girls are the absolute most toxic breed of women ! All women are bad but black women are the fucking worst ! They know better than any woman how to abuse the system and screw men over. There’s a reason most black guys don’t even like their own women, those ratchet black girl stereotypes are based on facts... "
99,ehqwhuu,"Another Black woman checking in here and from the 2 posts that I read, they're dead on. I'd also like to add that in addition of the protection that black males get regarding sexual assault, the onus is almost always placed on the girl. There's a word that is pretty popular in the Black community and it's used to describe girls who are ""promiscuous"", sexually curious or they just develop fast. Black girls are also demonized for how their bodies naturally grow. I've had random women comment on my child's body when she was only about 4-5 years old. Saying things like ""she's shaped like a grown woman"". I wish I had this mindset back then because I would have definitely told them she's shaped like a damn 4-5 year old child, not a grown ass woman. We call that ""fast"". Little girls and teenage girls are expected to carry themselves a certain way so as to not tempt GROWN men. ""Stop walking around this house with them lil' ass shorts on. It's a man in here"", things that like are said to make girls feel like it's their responsibility to control a man's actions. If a girl is sexually abused, it's ""where was the mama?"", again, the onus being placed on the woman not not the man who committed the act. And I won't excuse other Black women because they will rather throw their girls to the wolves rather than throw their man in the street. If that man starts coming on to that girl or actually takes it further with her, it's ""she knew better. She ain't stupid, she knew what she was doing!"" u/DesireeDominique quoted 60% of black girls are sexually abused but I think it may be even higher than that. Many in the Black community excuse Black men's actions because it's all about protecting the Black male, even if that means neglecting the safety of Black women and girls so they like to try to make it seem like sexual assault and abuse is a white male problem but truth is black girls are more likely to be sexually assaulted/abused before age 18 than our Latina, White and Asian counterparts. And we all know most crimes aren't interracial so what does that mean? Yes, white males make up the majority of sexual assault prosecutions, but some of that is because many in the Black community don't hold predators accountable. Instead, they protect them. Oh, it's not your fault June Bug, that girl shouldn't have been tempting you with her underdeveloped brain and body. I've even witnessed grown men-**with daughters**-say ""R. Kelly was wrong but you know, those girls aren't r\*\*\*\*\*d, they knew what they were doing. I remember seeing 16 and 17 year old fEmALeS being picked up at school by men in their 20s"". I understand the history between Black men in the U.S. and the judicial system but the BC uses that history to leave Black girls and women unprotected. It's not usual to hear something like ""I don't want them white people in my business"" when it comes to matters where ""them white people"" should be in our business but Black girls and women continue to suffer. And also, let me say that many Black women are perpetrators of this whole Black male protection crap. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not me, though. I say toss their asses to fire. "
100,ei2maqf,"&gt; Black Girls Are 4 Times More Likely to Be Arrested at School Than White Girls  

translation: Black girls are four times more likely to abuse their teachers than white girls .."
101,efn1m4g,"Having lived in a primarily black community for a lot of my childhood, it seems like young black girls are kind of are expected to be super sexual at younger ages.

11 and 12 year olds were doing it at school. So I wouldn't be surprised if there was a significant bit of the community around R. Kelly to think that these 14 or 15 year olds wanted it and were the initiators of their own abuse.

And sure 14 or 15 year old girls probably do want to fuck rich talented celebrities, regardless of race, but the adult isnt supposed to just fuck them. And fucking children is only the tip of the r. Kelly ice berg."
102,efy1w4a,"&gt; You read a story about partner abuse and domestic violence (which was likely actually a woman defending herself against an abusive man....I

Maybe so but from what everyone was saying they were clowning him for not doing *enough*, so it seemed like she was the aggressor.

&gt; I notice you're ignoring that part now and saying ""chick can claim anything"", can't men claim anything too?) and decided to talk about men's self defense and men who have problems with ""girls who think they're stronger than they are"".


That’s true but again I was going off what everyone was saying which is that Bow Wow was the victim, not her, and that he didn’t do enough to defend himself which is why he got those bruises. I didn’t assume she was the aggressor out of nowhere.

Ofc I would talk about men’s self defense when I thought he was the one that needed to protect himself. I brought up guys who hate girls who think they’re stronger than they are because you’re talking about how black girls are seen as tougher as they are and I’m telling you I’ve seen guys say different things, even if that’s true. 


&gt; You might be a black woman, but you sound a lot more concerned about men's right to retaliate than you do the wellbeing of black women (who have extremely high rates of abuse and death from men), believing women, OR men who are dealing with abuse.

Lol not really. I’m concerned about *both*. Believe it or not, statistics are general trends. I did focus on the power dynamic and that wasn’t enough for you. Clearly saying women can always be victims of sexual assault and violence and not aggressors will be enough for you, right? I never said men have a right to beat up women as they see fit, but you can’t paint women as this vulnerable being and at the same time absolve them of the consequences of their own actions if they instigate a physical fight, even if they’re the weaker sex. I did say a man shouldn’t go too far when they’re trying to defend themselves and you overlooked that. Also, I’m very familiar with domestic violence and how it affects women irl. You don’t need to tell me about the statistics for women.


&gt; On a side note Bow Wow has a history of being way too quick to write off abuse allegations and go on the offensive against accusers. His word is suspect.

Honey, I was just going off what everyone was saying, so don’t go after *me*. 






"
103,ecaxz3o,"1. That wasn't addressed at me so I never thought you were, but it came off like an insult to me so maybe you should consider the tone of what you say? That's what a responsible adult would do after all.

2. No one said it was a system of forced slavery, just that (mostly poor and black) boys are steered into an industry where there is only one outlet to realize meaningful returns from the investment they made and that the incredibly owners of that monopoly abuse their advantaged position to treat the few athletes that make it there far worse than they could afford to. Do you disagree with any of that?"
104,edi0deu,"I brought this up about YBN jay and nahmir and some of my old mates tried to laugh at me Lol. Sadly, a lot of women think black boys are more mature than they are and take advantage of that. I hope one day black boys receive way more support to sexual manipulation and abuse than they currently do. At least guys in general."
105,edpinzu,"When it comes to R Kelly I think it really is that people can’t see past what he’s contributed to the culture. It was the same thing with Bill Cosby, it’s hard to see one of your icons fall. 

When it comes to sexual abuse against black girls, I think it’s internalized misogynoir. Black girls (and boys) are viewed as older and more mature than their white counterparts. Black girls are viewed as being sexually open and “fast” even when they are not. People internalize the stereotype that black women are loose and promiscuous. Therefore when black girls are taken advantage of, it’s assumed that they were somehow asking for it. "
106,ee37hmj,"Black community has the highest domestic violence rates, abuse and rape. So these boys or men arent taught to treat girls and women right. More so that black girls are raised to act like men to defend themselves."

One case of 'paddling' was so bad, the ACLU picked up on it:

&gt;There have been reports of students suffering worse injuries, including blood clots and broken bones. The ACLU and Human Rights Watch described the case of Tim L., a Texas fifth-grader who was beaten so brutally in 2003 that his genitals were bruised and swollen and his mother reported having to “pull the underwear off his behind from the dried blood.”

&gt;The mother of one of the Texas girls said that after her daughter was paddled, her bottom “almost looked like it had been burned and blistered, it was so bad.”

*This* is legal in 19 states(39 countries have banned it). Each year, 160,000 students are subject to corporal punishment. Not to mention, that's the quantitative data on the corporal punishment, not the qualitative data, as in how severe it actually is. It's heavily concentrated in Southern states, and the federal government routinely does not include it in its initiatives for school discipline reform, leading to low public knowledge([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5766273/)). Let's not forget that students with disabilities are also disproportionately likely to face it, making up 13.8% of school students but 18.8% of those facing corporal punishment and are more likely than their peers in where its most severe to face such punishment. 

*On intersections of Gender, Disability, and Race*:

&gt;Black boys have the highest overall rate of school corporal punishment at 16%, followed by White boys at 9%[followed by black girls at 6%, and white girls at 2%]. Black boys are 1.8 times as likely as White boys to be corporally punished, while Black girls are 3 times as likely as White girls to be corporally punished...Contrary to our prediction, however, Black boys with disabilities are not corporally punished at the highest rate...[full chart picture](http://prntscr.com/kr50qi).

This isn't even accounting for the [school-to-prison pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School-to-prison_pipeline). The effects of such drastic measures on children has been measured and its come back as resoundingly negative. States that use corporal punishment do noticeably worse, (looking at you southern states), they also see the least improvement overall in scores. For the students, it breeds asocial behavior.

&gt;Many children who have been subjected to hitting, paddling or other harsh disciplinary practices have reported subsequent problems with depression, fear and anger. These students frequently withdraw from school activities and disengage academically. The Society for Adolescent Medicine has found that victims of corporal punishment often develop ""deteriorating peer relationships, difficulty with concentration, lowered school achievement, antisocial behavior, intense dislike of authority, somatic complaints, a tendency for school avoidance and school drop-out, and other evidence of negative high-risk adolescent behavior.""[source](https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/04/15/corporal-punishment-schools-and-its-effect-academic-success-joint-hrw/aclu-statement#_ftn8)

&gt;A 2012 study published in Pediatrics reported that harsh physical punishment was associated with increased odds of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and personality disorders. Even when the physical punishment wasn't considered child abuse, the researchers found that corporal punishment placed children at a higher risk of developing almost every type of mental illness.[source](https://www.verywellfamily.com/facts-about-corporal-punishment-1094806)

We careened into corporal punishment there, but lets reel it back in to other punishments young boys face. As aforementioned, they're suspended more often. Something faced by millions of students each year. Boys make up 54% of pre-school children, but make up 79% of those suspended and 82% of those suspended multiple times. Black children make up 18% of pre-school children but 48% of those suspended. While boys make up more than 60% of suspensions, black girls also face more suspension than any other demographic of girls *and most boys*— including white boys. Boys make up 51% of those enrolled in schools but make up 67% of school suspensions, 68% of single school suspensions, 72% of multiple out-of-school suspensions, and 74% of Expulsions. Black students also disproportionately make up the amount of students receiving arrests and refferals to law enforcement.[source](https://ocrdata.ed.gov/downloads/crdc-school-discipline-snapshot.pdf). 

* Stereotypes and prejudices are also [harming boys](https://www.bbc.com/news/education-31751672). Boys get *worse grades* for the *exact same work*. 

&gt;An OECD report on gender in education, **across more than 60 countries, found that girls receive higher marks compared with boys of the same ability.** Researchers suggest girls are better behaved in class and this influences how teachers perceive their work. Differences in school results can sometimes ""have little to do with ability"", says the study.""

&gt;In contrast, boys are more likely to be hostile towards school and likely to do fewer hours of homework, says the OECD study.

&gt;From a young age, boys are less likely to raise their hand in class to ask to speak, they are worse at waiting their turn to speak or engage in an activity, they are less likely to listen and pay attention before starting a project,"" says the study. **And as they get older, boys are more likely to ""start withdrawing in class and becoming disengaged"". When it comes to teachers' marking, the study says there is a consistent pattern of girls' work being ""marked up"".** It suggests that ""teachers hold stereotypical ideas about boys' and girls' academic strengths and weaknesses"". Teachers are said to reward ""organisational skills, good behaviour and compliance"" rather than objectively marking pupils' work. The findings suggested that teachers needed to be aware of ""gender bias"".

*Note: It's important to remember that this does not translate to out of school success, as the researchers state. Girl's academic advantages don't necessarily translate to advantages later in life, especially the labour market where they still face pay and treatment discrimination and/or gaps.*

Stereotype threads and data based on achievement [can also impact boys](https://theconversation.com/stereotypes-can-hold-boys-back-in-school-too-72035). 

&gt;By age six, girls are less likely than boys to view their own gender as brilliant and express interest in activities described as for “really, really smart” children, according to 2017 research published in Science. Many major media outlets reported these findings. Most of the coverage, however, overlooked another key finding from the same study: Boys were less likely to say their own gender gets top grades in school.
The beliefs of children matter because they could shape students’ interests and achievement over time, other research suggests. For instance, one 2013 experiment found that telling elementary school children “girls do better than boys” in school made boys – but not girls – perform worse on a series of academic tests. These expectations can work both ways: When researchers told children that boys and girls would perform the same, boys’ academic performance improved.

&gt;Stereotypes could negatively affect boys too. As experiments on elementary school children suggest, beliefs about boys’ academic inferiority or poor reading ability could make boys underperform on evaluative academic tests. Teachers’ stereotypes also matter. For instance, teachers’ beliefs that girls are better readers predict declines from grade five to grade six in boys’ – but not girls’ – confidence in their reading skills. Researchers also find that teachers often view boys as “lazy, disruptive, unfocused, and lacking motivation.” This stereotype about troublesome boys could negatively bias teachers’ perceptions of boys’ learning, one experiment found.

To settle the point on grades: *girls have been getting better grades across all subjects for nearly a century*. This includes *math and science*, things typically assosciated with boys. However for standardized tests and bench-marking, it is a different story. Girls do perform worse on these subjects there but still excel in writing and reading. Besides the well known difference in college enrollment rates and graduation rates, [guys also more likely than women to drop out of college at whatever age](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/08/why-men-are-the-new-college-minority/536103/?utm_source=atlfb).

*End Notes*:

- Forgive my very poor formatting and sourcing tagging, but my posts scope sort of grew as I wrote it...

- Lets not forget: poor white boys, and boys of other ethnicities like Native Americans or Asians also face challenges. My post was quite cisnormative, but Transmen are included too. 

-People should stop regurgitating myths about the nature of boys achievement in education. One of the big ones is over attributing our collective lack of success to poor attitude, lazyness, or toxicity in pursuing other things besides academic achievement(edit, note: I am not addressing the proven economic significance for attending college for girls versus boys). Another one assuming this can be overwhelmingly changed by more male role models in schools. This is also bullshit. There has been extreme government oversight which has compounded this problem to the point it is at now. Not to mention, that this is a trend observed in multiple countries and needs specialized solutions to properly fix.

109,e5pztbq,"The thing is I've watched Serena in different contexts.  And one thing that she absolutely is about is ""Fairness"".  I remember that Punk'd episode she was in (that show showed a lot of celebs' true colors) where she drove her vehicle all around while on an errand at a store for the good of a random ""wronged"" stranger; trying to help them... And kept repeating that something unfair happened to that person and that bothered her (can't remember the exact prank but she came off so well).

I also remember her chasing down someone who swiped her handbag and literally getting it back from him (that honestly was dangerous, but it demonstrates who she is).

This is a ""thing"" for her.

Everyone has their personal thing that automatically makes you want to box.  For parents? That snap often is threatening their child.  For Serena it has been for a long time any sense that ""just treatment"" isn't being given.

And I'm sorry but that ""some black girls are dainty and some aren't"" is just bullshit. racists will latch onto that so they can feel justified in saying ""Serena isn't one of the dainty ones"".

We can be and are all different things in different contexts.   And honestly? Aside from her body, which is hers courtesy of being an athlete, she's actually more on that excuse me, please, thank you train, than most. Even her rants during the match was full of that, unlike so many white men who went off.  Connors straight up called the umpire a ""cunt"" and no points where taken.

Again, perceived fair treatment and not just for herself (hence speaking against the booing during Naomi's announcement as the winner), is her button.

EDIT:

I think at this point she knows she can't win for losing.  Like you said she's endured a lot all her life. Just existing on the courts meant and still means constant racist abuse.  And the common thought is, we have to rise above it and pretend it doesn't hurt.

Why she should swallow her hurt and pain for the sake of white people's opinions? and be ""better"", for those who will see her as those slurs, regardless?  She might as well let it out and not bury it in a strained smile that will harm her even more.

We all know that Malcolm X quote, paraphrasing the most disrespected and unprotected person in America is the black woman."
110,e2wu41a,"See this is why when people start going on about poor black trans women I roll my eyes and keep it moving. Not only do black TIM have the same rampant narcisism of many other TIM, they also share the tendency of other black men to freely shit on black women and expect us to not only appreciate it but to uplift and love them. This dude can join all his other brother who think black women are supposed to be his punching bag and fuck all the way off. 

How dare he even suggest that trans people suffer sexual assault more. Rates of sexual abuse for black girls before they reach the age of 18 range from 37% to 60%. Black girls are more likely to experience multiple forms or abuse when growing up. Nationally  40 percent of victims of sex trafficking are African-Americans, that percentage goes even higher in large metropolitan areas. Those victims are overwhelmingly black girls and women. That's some awesome privildge right there. 

Outside of issues like sexual assault, stats for black women are pretty fucking dim. Black women are more likely to be killed by an intimate partner than any race of woman in this country. We face higher rates of incarceration, greater risk of HIV infection, higher rates over poverty. Maternal mortality rates for black women are sky high.  I could go on and on about how much ""cis privilege"" black women have but of course it would be pointless because not only does this asshole have the male tendency to dismiss female suffering, he seems to share the tendency of too many black men to dismiss black women's suffering in particular. "
111,dymho5h,"I know, that's what most people said: this case was heavily commented because most of us assumed the French law makes any sexual relationship between an adult and a minor who's less than 15 years old non-consensual/rape (and yes, makes the abuser a pedophile, who thus should be sentenced to a harsher sentence than if he had raped an adult). But it turns out there is no age statute below which a minor is said to not being able to consent. That will probably change very soon though (as I wrote, the government is about to present a bill in the Parliament, which covers several new measures related to sexual and sexist offenses. I don't remember exactly what the new proposed law will be on that particular matter: sorry I can't be bothered to google it right now, I remember reading about it and noting that feminist activists apparently thought it was not good enough, it was quite complicated to understand in my opnion. I'll write about it here in future threads when the MPs vote on it). 

So (I just checked again the articles on these 2 cases)

-1) The man was 28 and the girl,""Sarah"", 11 (It happened in April 2017). The man's lawyer said that the girl lied about her age: she allegedly told him she was 18. She on the contrary said that she showed him her school liaison diary (on which you can clearly see that she was in her first year of middle school). The man had approached her before in a park near her building and chit-chatted to her. When he approached her again as she was walking back from school, she followed him to his flat and they 'had sex'. She then knocked on her neighbor's door and told her about it, allegedly saying that ""she kind of agreed to it"", but then when said neighbor called the mom (who was at work) and the 11 year-old repeated her story she expressed her confusion and shock. The mom filed a complaint for rape (as you would do), but since there was no use of violence, threat or surprise and that the age difference apparently isn't considered to be a sufficient element to qualify as ""constraint"", the magistrate decided that a jury wouldn't (and shouldn't - in the prosecuter's eyes, maybe, idk) convict him for ""rape"", but opted for the lesser offense of ""atteinte sexuelle"" (= up to 5 years of prison only). Journalists published articles about the case shortly before the trial and when the trial occurred they decided to postpone it, I *think* this time he will be judged for rape. So we'll see.

-2) The man was 22 and the girl, ""Justine"",  11 too (I remembered 13, I don't know why). This one happened in 2009, but went on trial last autumn only (which is totally 'normal' in France. Our justice system is vastly underfinanced). The  details are also quite minimal. The man met the girl outside of her building and she followed him to a nearby park were he 'had sex' with her on the ground. She allegedly said that she said no but that he was preventing her from moving. The man said that she had consented and that she had lied, saying she was ""14, about to turn 15"" or ""15, about to turn 16"" - depending on the articles (the age of ""sexual majority"" I was mentioning before, that most people know about, is 15, so I mean, even if she lied... you're the adult, play it safe). Anyway she's 11, this 22 year-old man has sex with her, she doesn't tell anyone... she ends up pregnant. That's when she tells her parents. A complaint is filed. The trial happens almost 10 years later (...) (what about the pregnancy you may ask. Well, she didn't have an abortion, it was much too late, she had the baby. Great story! The kid was given up to the social services. Poor little kids, both of them. ). So the trial is for ""rape"" (that's why it happened much later than in the other case: the Court is different and since they are overworked, victims -and innnocent until proven guilty accused people- have to wait several years before a verdict. Since the elements presented couldn't prove this wasn't consensual, the man was acquitted. Yep. Again, there were articles (these two trials happened during the same time period last autumn, which probably boosted the media attention, plus it was during the MeToo movement) and the Court decided to appeal the decision so there will be a new trial too for this case. 

-Both stories are very similar. One might really wonder why in one case the prosecution decided that, given the lack of elements proving the rape in their minds, they decided to treat it as ""atteinte sexuelle"" (sexual abuse, instead of sexual crime), while in the other case they considered it rape and asked for 8 years (which the jurors didn't agree with). There is another similarity: incidentally both little girls were black. This led to comments about the fact that maybe the outcome would have been different if it had been white girls. (Black girls are seen as more ""mature"" sexually, or more quickly). Many people think that a girl's physical appearance is indicative of her psychological, physiological and cognitive maturity (We don't even know what they looked like at the time, obviously. But I mean, even if they looked older than 11 - I know it can be actually difficult to assess the age of girls between the ages of 14 and 20ish, but 11... not buying it at all and that wouldn't even matter if they looked 18). There were  rumors propagated online, which to my knowledge are totally made up: a rumor about the fact that one of these two girls had fake ID papers (= an immigrant whose mother lied in order to get the nationality) and thus wasn't in fact 11 but older : completely false apparently. Another rumor about the fact that one of the girl (the same maybe, I don't remember which case that was about since the two were being commented at the same time) had sent nudes to adult men : again, apparently made up but propagated on online forums (that wouldn't matter either imo). I even read comments about the fact that one of the mothers was prostituting her 11 year-old daughter. It's crazy what people can write on such cases without having any access to the details. (Looking at you /r/france...)

Sorry for the very long reply, but I always end up giving out many details. "
112,dxfrjz9,"The study tracked the eye movement of teachers seeking misbehavior in a video (in which none existed), and found that they tended towards black boys. This is not conclusive of unfounded bias; this is clickbait. In no way did the researchers control to see if black boys are in fact more likely to misbehave. If this were the teacher's experience, this would explain the bias. 

Is it racist or sexist to say that black males are more prone to misbehavior? Not unless statistics are bigoted.

&gt;57.6% of black children, 31.2% of Hispanic children, and 20.7% of white children are living absent their biological fathers.

...

&gt; As supported by the data below, children from fatherless homes are more likely to be poor, become involved in drug and alcohol abuse, drop out of school, and suffer from health and emotional problems.

source: http://www.fathers.com/statistics-and-research/the-consequences-of-fatherlessness/

The only missing piece of the puzzle is: why boys, not girls. The answer is that the typical public school environment is more suited towards girls. 

&gt;The study, released Nov. 30 in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, found that the more time kids in Grade 1 spent sitting and the less time they spent being physically active, the fewer gains they made in reading in the two following years. In first grade, a lot of sedentary time and no running around also had a negative impact on their ability to do math.

113,duoksx0,"&gt; No one should be surprised that R. Kelly is not welcome in Wakanda. He’s barely welcome here in the U.S. The #MuteRKelly campaign has successfully shut down a number of R. Kelly’s shows around the country.

&gt; “I have been hearing about R. Kelly’s sexual abuse of young black women since I was in my teens. Every few years more women come out with their stories. More images and videos surface. More black girls are scarred for life just as they are coming into their womanhood and sexuality,” said Oronike Odeleye, co-creator of #MuteRKelly.

Even happier to hear about this than people roasting him on Twitter, tbh."
114,du544a3,"This is why I no longer donate to Columbia. My family and I used to donate, but when they started admitting MTT to Barnard, we let them know that the money faucets were turned off. I didn’t go to Barnard, but they were my friends across the street. I opted to go to the co-ed school, but they didn’t. The University could have, at the very least, allow the youngest class to graduate so that students who were attending Barnard were ones who chose to go there after this disgraceful policy. 

As for this “expecting people to know” stuff is privileged bullshit, they need to stop. Everyone gets a handbook and documents regarding services the university offers. “Go Ask Alice” is universally known on campus for reproductive health services, in addition to the general health services department. These people are at an Ivy League school. Back when I went, being able to read wasn’t called privileged, it was a requirement. What’s next? “Columbia serves food in the dining hall and it is privileged to expect people to know that and to know where John Jay Hall is located”? Are women obligated to hold their dicks and their hands lest they be accused of being literally worse than Hitler? 

So many people wrongly associate radfems with “white feminism.” I’m here to tell you that despite what a few quislings on Twitter and fake feminist websites will tell you, radical feminism resonates with black women. Most of us are practical voters and aren’t given to pie in the sky policies or plain silliness because we have to be practical. We see radical feminism as feminism that represents us. We see feminism that focuses on helping men get into women’s locker rooms rather than the fact that black women having the highest rate of maternal mortality as being white feminism. When we see so-called feminists screeching when menstruation or tampons are mentioned, we see that they are ignoring DV and how to help black women report and find support. We also see them trying to bring men into the precious few spaces DV survivors haves. Libfems are focused on getting boys into the girls room while we are working on the issue of the principal’s office to prison pipeline black girls are facing. We are worried about the disturbing acceleration of incarceration and imposition of disproportionately harsh prison sentences black women face. We worry about the sexual abuse and exploitation they face. Libfems are worried about putting men in their prisons because they are safer, thus spreading the lie that prison is safe for women. We see them comparing MTT to Rosa Parks and we get pissed. Rosa Parks was not the defanged figure she’s made out to be. Rosa Parks was a feminist and an anti-rape activist. Rosa Parks planned on not giving up her seat, she wasn’t a weary and put upon lady. She was brave and she was a hero. Facing down Jim Crow Alabama alone on a bus is brave; posing for airbrushed photos on the cover of Vanity Fair is not.

What’s most insulting is to hear a man tell me he must be called a woman because he says it is so when we have been fighting to be included in the definition. Sojourner Truth didn’t say “Ain’t I a lady” for Bruce Jenner to pop up and say, “No, but I am.” The choice feminists are trying to trick black women and we aren’t falling for the bullshit. We see what our girls are sexualized at a young age and how the glorified porn body/culture is pushing them into having illegal butt shots in the back of hair salons. We don’t live in an alternate universe where becoming a sex worker is a choice so much as it is coercion via poverty. The fake feminists think they have us fooled into thinking that objecting to men colonizing our spaces is an indicator of racism and white supremacy. They think that calling someone a TERF moves us. We have appropriated TERF and created our own acronym: Telling Everybody Real Facts. 

They don’t see that we see that centering feminism around men is as helpful to women as centering anti-racism around the feelings of Rachel Dolezal or whatever new name she’s going by. You can find discussions of radical feminism on black message boards saying all these things. "
115,dquz46u,"Yeah but you're honestly telling me that it's not weird one story came after the movement started and he was already considered fucked, then more came out destroying him. I don't know how many times i have read articles from this year, few from after the movement started, about r. Kelly victims speaking up about his abuse. Still ignored.  So honestly this moment hasn't helped his victims at all. Why? This group of victims is the ONLY group that is ALL black. Its eye opening. What other reason would there be for the difference in public perception? I'm honestly looking for any other reason. Because I don't want  it to be racism.

117,dklxepr,"Not married, but disagree that women benefit from marriage. The reality is most men are not faithful, not loyal and not stable. Many are mentally and physically abusive especially in black communities.

Black women are more likely to be killed by a partner than any group of women.

Coupled with the mental and physical abuse and sexual abuse many black girls face at the hands of men in their communities it's not surprising that many don't want to get married and see men as threats to their livelihood and that of their children.

60% of black girls are sexually abused before they turn 18, and of those who were it was done by a male family member. We all know the stories of the creepy uncle in the black community. 

And it's not that simple to say it's the men women are choosing, but you have to realize men are very good at hiding that they are abusers and wish harm to a woman and her kids. They're manipulative, conniving, and and very charming. 

I think it's fair to say black women don't want to get married mainly because they don't feel like there are any men worth marrying, whether it be for lack of finances or the instability and trauma having a long term partner causes in their life."
118,dkm7bdg,"Black female history in America really needs to better understood and talked about. We have a history of being abused by men, Black men and White men. The domestic violence in the black community is not just well documented now, it was also known back in the 1930s and before. It was believed that many Black men took their frustrations out on their wives during Jim Crow. White men and Black men both raped Black women openly without punishment throughout our history. Today, Black women deal with a huge mount of sexual abuse and it's estimated that 70% of Black girls are molested or sexually abused before age 18. So I'm not sure why people act shocked that many Black women perhaps felt their lives could be easier without men. Not all, but I'd say there's probably a cultural sentiment that men come with problems. "

122,ft0ymkl,"1. Justine Damond was white. People were quicker to accept that she was not only innocent, but that it was unreasonable to think she was a threat. This phenomena starts as young as 8 I believe. At **8** years old, black girls are seen as less innocent than white girls. Breonna was a grown black woman. And a *black* woman - she is not light skinned with 2c hair and a skinny nose and green eyes. She is the exact type black in appearance that illicits the strongest racial bias
2. Officer Noor was black. Not just back, but *Somali*. Racism towards Somali people here is even deeper and more widespread than simply racism. Even many black people are bigoted to them. The cops were not exactly bending over backwards to stand with Noor. His own partner threw him under the bus, which is a big part of why they were able to convict on manslaughter. 
3. Damond was Australian. We found that this wasn't just a national tragedy, it was an international crisis. Australia was LIVID. And they applied a ton of heat in getting justice. 
4. It wasn't an accident. It wasn't a mistake. It wasn't an arrest gone wrong. It was a ""why in gods name did you even have your gun drawn in the first place???"" These shitbags will argue this was a tragic mistake. Noor's wasn't a mistake. It was undeniably negligence. The officers can explain why they thought it was a good idea to shoot into the house (cause they thought they were at the right house). Noor had no explanation whatsoever. Shooting a person for approaching your car doesn't make sense. It's not 'gone wrong'. It's just 'wow who gave this man a gun??'

As egregious as Breonnas murder is, it's hard to get people who have faith int he police to see it as anything but a horrifying accident. 

With Justine, his own partner said it wasn't a reasonable mistake. And so for the people who have faiths in the cops....and they're being told that this wasn't good policing BY A COP...clearly Noor is a danger to the public
5. Breonna is black. It needs to be said twice. White America overwhelmingly will not see their wives and their daughters and their sisters and their mothers in Breonnas face. ""It could have been any one of us..."" The twin cities said to themselves. Not a lot of white people are saying that because it's clear that it couldn't have been. If never is.

_____________________________

The protests in the US are a pivotal moment and people of colour need active allyship

The writer is a reader in equity and education at Goldsmiths College, University of London

A very privileged white man recently told me with an indulgent chuckle how much he enjoyed his privilege. I was not amused. For people of colour, white privilege and power shape our lives, restrict our success and, as we were starkly reminded in recent weeks, can even kill. No matter how well-crafted an organisation’s equality and diversity policy, the claims of “tolerance” or the apparent commitment to “embracing diversity”, whiteness can crush them all — and often does.

People of colour know this. We do not need the empirical evidence to tell us that black women are more likely to die in childbirth or that black boys are more likely to be excluded from school even when engaging in the same disruptive behaviour as their white counterparts. We did not need to wait for a study to tell us that people with “foreign sounding names” have to send 74 per cent more applications than their white counterparts before being called for an interview — even when the qualifications and experience are the same. 

Or that young people of colour, in the UK, are more likely to be sentenced to custody than their white peers. We do not need more reviews to tell us we are not progressing in workplaces at the same rate as our white colleagues. We already know. Many of us spend an inordinate amount of time and energy trying to work out how to survive the rules that white people make and benefit from. 

While many white people seem to have discovered the horrors of racism as a result of George Floyd’s murder, it would be a mistake to overlook the pervasive racism happening around us every day. For the truth is Floyd’s murder sits at the chilling end of a continuum of racism that many of us have been talking about, shouting and protesting about for decades.

Whiteness — specifically white power — sits at the heart of racism. This is why white people are described as privileged. Privilege does not simply refer to financial or socio-economic status. It means living without the consequences of racism. Stating this is to risk the ire of most white people. They tend to become defensive, angry or deny that racism is a problem, despite the fact they have not experienced an entire life subjected to it. 

Then there are the liberal intellectuals who believe they have demonstrated sufficient markers of their anti-racist credentials because they have read a bit of Kimberlé Crenshaw — the academic who coined the term “intersectionality” to describe how different forms of oppression intersect. Or, as we have seen on Twitter, there are those who quote a few lines from Martin Luther King. 

Liberal intellectuals will happily make decisions about race in the workplace, argue with people of colour about race, sit on boards or committees or even become race sponsors without doing any work to understand their whiteness and how it has an impact on their assumptions and treatment of racially minoritised groups. 

There are, of course, white people who imagine themselves anti-racist while doing little if anything to impact positively on the experiences of people of colour. As the author Marlon James and others have stated, being anti-racist requires action: it is not a passive state of existence.

Becoming aware of whiteness and challenging passivity or denial is an essential component of becoming a white ally. Being an ally means being willing to become the antithesis of everything white people have learnt about being white. Being humble and learning to listen actively are crucial, as a useful short video from the National Union of Students points out. This, and other videos, are easily found on YouTube and are a very accessible way for individuals and teams to go about educating themselves about allyship. 

White allies do not pretend the world is living in perfect harmony, nor do they ignore or trivialise race. If the only senior Asian woman is about to leave an organisation where Asian women are under-represented and she is good at her job, white allies will flag these points to senior management and be keen to check whether there is anything that can be done to keep her. White allies are not quiet bystanders to potential or actual racial injustice. 

Allyship also means letting go of the assumption that white people get to determine what constitutes racism. This is highlighted by the black lesbian feminist writer and journalist Kesiena Boom, who has written a 100-point guide to how white people can make life less frustrating for people of colour. (Sample point: “Avoid phrases like “But I have a Black friend! I can’t be racist!” You know that’s BS, as well as we do.”)
Active allyship takes effort

Being an ally means seeing race and acknowledging that white people have a racial identity. In practical terms, it means when we talk about gender, acknowledging that white women’s experiences overlap with but are different to those of women of colour. White women may be disadvantaged because of their gender, but they are privileged because of their racial identity. When we talk about social mobility, employment, education, health, policing and even which news is reported and how, race plays a role. Usually it is white people who are shaping the discourse and white people who are making the decisions.

This is evident even when white people promise commitment to racial justice in the workplace. It is usually white people who make the decision about who to appoint, the resources they will be given, what they can say and do. In their book Acting white? Rethinking race in post-racial America, US scholars Devon W Carbado and Mitu Gulati argue that white institutions tend to favour and progress people of colour who are “racially palatable” and who will do little to disrupt organisational norms. Those who are more closely aligned to their racial identity are unlikely to be seen as a fit and are, consequently, less likely to succeed. 

Being a white ally takes work. It is a constant process, not a static point one arrives at and can say the job is complete. It is why despite equalities legislation, there remains a need for organisations — many of them small charities operating on tight budgets — such as the Runnymede Trust, StopWatch, InQuest, Race on the Agenda, brap and Equally Ours. Their publications offer useful resources and information about racial justice in the workplace as well as in other sectors. 

There is, of course, a dark perversity to white allyship that is not often mentioned in most debates about racial justice. White allyship means divesting from the very histories, structures, systems, assumptions and behaviours that keep white people in positions of power. And, generally, power is to be maintained, not relinquished."

I failed to defend them? You failed to even argue against them. If you agree that sometimes people make backhanded compliments then you agree with microagressions. If I tell a black girl that ""she is pretty for a black girl"" that implies that (I think) all black girls are ugly. People take offense to being implicitly called ugly especially if it's just on account of their race. Do you agree with this example? Then congrats, you agree with ""the left"" if only you weren't such a contrarian.  Also backhanded compliments are microagressions.

&gt; You believe giving control over the language to rabid ideologues is 'harmless'. Well, I'm not sure why you do think that it's worth sperging out over people who do want to resist attempts to control their speech, or oppose such nonsense as 'microaggressions'.

No, I believe gender neutral language  is harmless (as it doesn't harm me to be  revered to in a gender neutral manner nor should it or does it actuallt harm anyone). And, I believe agreeing that microagressions exist is harmless because they will exist whether you agree with the concept or not, so you might as well agree and stop denying this basic social reality.

&gt; You made no mention of the word 'professional' (or any variant) before this recent pair of posts. What you were cheering was his destruction over disagreeing with your ideology, which holds that people with 'shit ideas' (such as that microaggressions are nonsense) should be ostracized and personally destroyed.

I'm not going to look over my posts for this point, because it is irrelevant what I did or didn't mention considering I never argued that I thought he  is being kicked for any other reason. Rather you assumed that I must support kicking him out for simply his speech and not his lack of professionalism because you've already built a caricature of the radical left up in your head with which to argue; but it is nothing more than a strawman. What I was enjoying is his sperging outy for a month and being kicked out of school due to his own idiocy. Shit ideas should be ostracized because not all ideas are equal, but that's not the same as saying people shouldn't be allowed to have shit ideas.

&gt; Well, that's a nice trick, accuse the other party of doing what you yourself have been doing - particularly in this recent pair. 

Well are you or are you not attributing ideas to me that I have not claimed to hold and misinterpreting simple statements due to your own lack of nuance? I've already demonstrated that you are.

&gt; Provide me with entertainment? Or do you mean your dishonesty and strawmen. I can't tell you with certainty whether you managed to annoy me slightly with those.

You're being entertained? Well then that makes two of us. Tell me what positions of yours I've got wrong I'll gladly clarify.

You don't believe microaggresions exist. You think gender neutral language is harmful and an attempt to control language ,you think the student being kicked from school is a free speech issue, and you think I am a part of the regressive left. Are these your positions or not?

&gt; I already informed you that 'phenomena' is plural, yet here you are making the exact same mistake. The singular is 'phenomenon'. (I'm not correcting your spelling of aggression, since I believe it to be unintentional.)

If you did I didn't catch it. Perhaps it was an edit. Perhaps I didn't think it important enough to address. But it doesn't matter to me, I'll just fix whatever typos I care to.

&gt; You evidently care, but ""you should care"" is not my thesis. Rather, that this is not valid in any way, and you have failed to establish otherwise.

When I say why I should care, I really mean ""why anyone should care"" to clarify. You don't think it is possible and happens that soemone can unintentionally say somet inf insulting or demeaning to others?   

You're not in the middle ground position, unless you're position is ""I dont know if these concepts are valud either way"". You're amaking negative assertions and I am making positive ones. You also have a burden of proof. Make actual arguments please.

&gt; I don't care about insults, particularly from you. In fact, I'm glad to see you be as hypocritical as it gets.

When did I say I was against insulting people  who I wish to insult? I insult you because I don't care to consider how it affects you emotionally. For people I actually like, I would be considerate.

&gt; Strawman number... twelve, is it now? Where did I say that people aren't 'allowed' to be offended? Hell, in some instances, it's perfectly understandable. For example, a call to murder a particular group of people.

Now you finally understand what you've been doing to me (except much more frequently and severely) when I say ""where did I say"" and you fail to (and can't) provide a quote. And I doubt I strawmanned you 12 times, is so name them.

&gt; Where you and I differ is that you defend offense even when it's taken by people for extraordinarily stupid reasons. Not only that, you defend the soiling of the scientific enterprise by inventing polticized categories of utterances that strive simply to silence those who disagree with you. There's the difference. I combat people with arguments, you with personal destruction (where you are able, and where you are not, you support it).

Like I said, depends on the reason. Also sociology is a legitimate field, and they study society and social-ness amongst humans. Microagressions which is a valid concept fall into this category. Someone using microagressions to ""destroy people"" does not invalidate the concept. You've made no arguments btw. The rest of the your statement is yet another strawman.

&gt; For all your wordiness, and boy, isn't it obvious that you know how to pad a text - a great skill for being able to deliver vapid papers that give you a... B? But you don't have much substance, let alone arguments.

What can I say? I'm enjoying this.

&gt; It's noteworthy that you say that I ""haven't"" been silenced, not that you wouldn't want to do it. Have you not admitted that you think opposing microaggression hogwash is a ""shit idea"", and that ""shit ideas"" should be combated with social ostracism and personal destruction? 

Nope, I'm just not gonna defend someone  who is getting themselves kicked out of school due to their own professionalism. 


&gt; $50 that he'll claim that I only used 'strawman' because he did it here, even though I hadn't even read that part when I responded to the earlier post.

Well I dunno about that but you *have* egregiously strawmanned me, verifiably so."

131,eagf0vg,"Well. That's just untrue though. I dont have the numbers handy, but ~~many~~ more ~~times the number of~~ whites get killed by cops than blacks.

It's also true that something like 9 times the number of black boys are killed by other black boys than by memebers of another race. 

Edit:
The actual numbers might be something like 2 to 1.
&gt;1,388 people were killed by police in 2015, 318 (23%) of them black, and 560 (40%) of them white.

The risk numbers are disproportionately high for blacks, but they are still higher for whites in absolute terms.  Also, it's probably the case the most of these happen in certain geographic areas.  Anyway, strictly speaking, cop killings definitely do no ""fall almost entirely on our black citizens"".  And it's an issue regardless of who gets killed.

A more damning statistic is actually the number of bullets fired by american cops compared to other countries.
 
Mark Steyn:

&gt; So the biggest government in the free world chooses not to keep statistics on how many people get shot by law enforcement. So be it. It does keep figures on ""justifiable homicide"", which it defines as ""the killing of a felon by a law enforcement official in the line of duty"". When is a police homicide not ""justifiable""? Ah, well. At any rate, for 2012, the corpse count was 410.

&gt; By comparison, for the years 2012 and 2013 in England and Wales:

&gt; 'No fatal police shootings.'

&gt; In the Netherlands:

&gt;'The average for the last 35 years is three dead and 15 injured...'

&gt; In Germany, a nation of 80 million people, police in 2011 fatally shot six persons. In Denmark, police shot 11 people in 11 years, and this was felt to be so disturbing that the National Police Commissioner held an inquiry into why his cops had gotten so trigger-happy. In Australia, 41 people were shot by police in eight years, and the then Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone (whose friend thinks I'm ""eminently shaggable"", but I digress) thought that that was too high. In Iceland, police have fatally shot just one suspect. That's one guy in the entire history of the country. He was killed by police last December.

&gt; So comparisons between the kill rates from American police and those of other developed nations aren't worth bothering with. Indeed, the ""justifiable homicides"" of US cops are more like the total murder count for other advanced societies:

&gt; In Oz, the total number of murders per year is about 270, so a nation of 23 million would have to increase by 50 per cent to commit as many homicides as American law enforcement. In Canada, whose urban police departments have absorbed certain American practices, a dozen or so people get shot dead by cops each year, which is again somewhat short of the US rate. Indeed, that 2012 ""justifiable homicide"" figure of 410 compares to a total Canadian homicide count for 2011 of 598. In other words, in America 120,000 or so full-time law enforcement officers rack up the same number of homicides as about 24 million Canadians.

&gt; That strikes me as on the high side."

Yeah, I'm not sure I agree with that.

Edit: Also:

&gt;Every summer in big cities across America, teenaged black boys are killing each other in the hundreds over, frankly, nothing. That's somehow less important than what the occasional rogue cop does.

Well, yeah. I mean we do pay cops to like, you know, not murder.

How the fuck is a policeman murdering someone and getting away with it somehow less dangerous to our society than random murders in the streets? How could anyone argue that?

We pay cops to keep the streets safe. This dude is literally saying that the police can't do their job and they kill innocent citizens and we shouldn't care because sometimes gangs happen. I'm sure this guy knows his linguistics, but I think he should stick to that subject.

134,e5g4ujz,"I notice you said “my country”. Here in America, it was obviously a very pointed insult to black women. In every facet of American society, for 400+ years, black women have been told their hair is ugly, undesirable, and not as professional-looking as white women’s hair. 

It’s not a secret, they were told that point blank to their faces, and still are today. Little black girls are sent home everyday from mostly-white private schools because their hair is “unkempt,” which just means, it’s not made to look like white hair. If you look at their hair, it’s not unkempt at all. It’s racism. It’s not an afterthought in this country, it’s very, extremely, totally on purpose.

I’m a white woman, but the racism is as clear as the sky is blue. I’m telling you this because I want to make sure you understand that the way America views people of color vs any other country is extremely different, and based on hundreds of years of slavery, torture, sexual assault, and murder of black men and women—and that history has not gone away. It lives on in small towns, big cities, and our military. When they told black women their hair was not professional, that came from a real place—a historical and cultural place.

In many many American states, they still enslave black people, but it’s rebranded as for-profit prison work. In every state in America, black men and women are disproportionately shot and imprisoned by police, to the point where Jamaica warned their black male citizens against traveling to America.

I mean, there’s a million more things I could write, but my point is that calling black hair styles unprofessional is never a cute mistake."

Some brown people suffer in North America because they simply live on the wrong side of a border but share a new identical culture with peoples just north of them. 


People pour into Europe because they can't bare to live in whatever geometric shape was drawn in Central Asia 75 years ago.


Little black boys are being murdered and black girls kidnapped because they live in a geometric shape somewhere in Africa that pit two clans against one another. They live under an Arbitrary nation-state and now create mutual suffering amongst themselves. 


One shade of brown people keep another shade of brown people in the world's largest open air prison. Controlling their resources and economy. Why? They are fighting over lines in the sand. One group of brown people ended up there because a group of beige people wanted to murder them with impunity during a massive war over geometric shapes. 



We ended the concept of Counties, Principalities, Kingdoms and Empires. Arbitrary fiefdoms decided by religious affiliation, prestige and wealth. Inherited to a new leader like an antique car or extra bank account. We ended that backwards concept and now have a new one."
137,drycqpa,"I get what you're saying but i do disagree that the murder of Trayvon Martin was nuanced or gray without a clear perpetrator. Whether Trayvon threw the first *physical* punch or not the whole situation occured because it was instigated by Zimmerman. Zimmerman was a grown man who directly disobeyed authorities to disengage. Trayvon was a teen boy getting stalked by a stranger at night. If a man was following me at nighttime like that i would be terrified. What do you do? Run away, defend yourself, or what? Your fight or flight kicks in. Zimmerman used deadly force and Trayvon did not. And it all went down because Zimmerman judged Trayvon's skin color. 

Some states have terrible gun laws put in place by powerful gun lobbyist and gun companies making money. Because Zimmerman can get off on technicalities, and live to brag about what he did, doesnt mean i think justice was upheld. 

I also feel that black boys are not seen the same as white boys to a lot of white society. Trayvon is often held to the same expectations as a grown man with a gun instead of a youthful person with a typical teenager's underdeveloped brain who was put in a fearful situation. And it turns out he had every reason to be afraid. 

To me, this is the strongest tie with Emmett Til. ""Boys will be boys"" is a fair excuse for young males unless you're black. "

The ""we Muslims"" line is part of a trend I point out, that the same Alt-Right WM who hate Black and Muslim men want to BE Black and Muslim men.

Like this guy literally used the exact same words he used on Black boys towards Asian boys. He doesn't hate Black behavior because he thinks its immoral, but because he wants to do it himself.

&gt;In fact, I'll go further, and state this: these white women and girls think black males are superior to white males, and that the black race is superior to the white race. They are literally racist against their own race, especially men of their own race.

&gt; When a white female has sex with black males, she is announcing to the world that she supports, condones, and endorses black-on-white hate crimes. These white whores are basically shouting ""black boys are superior to white men and all white people in general, I hope black males rape, rob, murder and assault white people and I will reward these black males with sexual favors for doing so.""

142,ec6ekzh,"I've got a lot of strong opinions about this issue.   
I'm a white guy who grew up in australia of all places and I've always thought black women were CLEARLY the most attractive women. Literally as a 10 year old seeing salt n peppa music videos, or even shuffling through the covers of my mother's old soul music records or whatever I was just mesmerised and thought clearly white women could never be so magnificent. I have also always noticed society trying to tell me they were unattractive, but I feel like I've always seen straight through bullshit, quickly and easily. I remember being 8 in church and just thinking this is clearly made up nonsense, and that's just been the story of my life. I don't just believe what people say or have my opinions coerced or manipulated readily. 

I think there is objectively no truth to it (that black women are unattractive), and indeed the opposite. When militant black panther types spew their rhetoric that black people are gods and godesses and etc, I'm kind of like ""yeah... kinda"". It's a fair point. I mean it's an old cliche but just look at the dominance of black athletes, dramatically over representing themselves in sports and despite their disadvantage in society. What is attractiveness but an indicator of good genes and the potential to produce strong healthy capable offspring? Black people are stronger, faster, more agile and coordinated and skillful. Political correctness be damned, I have eyes, and I can read scientific data on muscle density and etc, notice trends. Just objectively as specimens they are more impressive. If we had a ""human show"" like a dog show the ""best in show"" would be black people all the time, I have no doubt. 

 There's been an active concerted effort to dictate to society at large what beauty is, starting at a tiny age with disney princesses and the link and then just relentlessly bombarding all media from then on. I'm lucky enough to be immune to it, but I think most guys are deep down somewhere in the core of their being. I've known guys, lots and lots of guys who would say ""ew"" when I said a black woman was attractive, could never admit one was, but I've been close enough to these guys to observe them over time and notice how they actually drool when they see black women in a special heightened way, how black women get their genuine attention more strikingly and it's just a case of actions speak louder than words. The media has made it unacceptable to admit black women are attractive, but I don't believe it's had much success in convincing our base primal instincts. They've made a similar push with ""skinny"" women, and again guys will say ""ew"" to slightly chubby women try and get a skinny girl on their arm and only feel comfortable admitting a skinny girl is attractive... but see those very same guys in the presence of a curvy girl bouncing all over the place and they can barely pick their jaw up off the floor. They'll try and mask it ""look at that heiffer hehe, go on a diet"" nervously smirking and chuckling while clearly aroused and struggling to deal with their feelings. 

The other thing with being attracted to black women, is even if you are brave enough to fight against the tide and put yourself out there and say they're attractive, you get this other type of backlash as well which is people accusing you of having a ""black fetish"". Ironically they've even managed to convince black ladies this is a bad thing, so poor black ladies are out there trying to find a guy who is attracted to them, while simultaneously ruling out the ones who can admit it because they have a fetish. Ever notice there is no such thing as a ""skinny blonde fetish""? They're trying to plant the idea subconsciously that being attracted to black women is abnormal, a sickness, being attracted to white ladies is just acceptable and normal. It's the ""correct"" thing to be. 

One last point, which is a triumphant one really in the face of all this nonsense. Is you can't keep black women down. All this dehumanising and degradation and barrage of negative messages relentlessly telling them they're ugly... can't budge their good strong instincts that they are beautiful. Despite all this black girls are ANYTHING but easy. No girl is harder to impress than a hot black girl, and even not so hot black girls have this unwavering instinctual belief in the value of their sex appeal. If you want to date black girls you have to drop a rung on the sexual marketplace, they just know they're better quality no matter what society says. White girls and asian girls you will see settling with unattractive gross guys well below the level of their male equivalent, black girls not so much. They just can't stomach unattractive guys, to their credit. They shouldn't. They have the best genes and they know it, even if consciously they've been beaten down by society. White guys know it too, most white guys know they wouldn't have a shot with black girls, on the one side they'll smirk and scoff about black girls not being pretty, then those same guys will concede that they know those girls wouldn't be interested. 

I think we all know the truth deep down, there's just this big weird game trying to cover it all up and twist things around. "
143,ff63qm7," How do you figure?  Most public schools are based on your region and based on the taxes collected within your municipality.

&gt;How is this racist to have black children go to a predominantly black school when they live in a predominantly black area?

The issue isn't they go to a school with more black kids. Its that they go to a school that's lower quality and face disadvantages there. 

&gt;This study is fuckin garbage, hard to read and understand, flies all over the place with its point, says it shouldn't even argue over segregation and instead over ""isolation"".  
&gt;  
&gt;frankly, I don't have time to read garbage so I'm gunna skip it. Sorry, its an internet argument and im not gunna waste my time.

Something being hard to read or understand doesn't make it bad, mate. It seems right now you're admitting to being a bad faith actor who isn't going to look at evidence they can't understand.

&gt;I don't like this study and its manipulating the data to make an argument that is horseshit.  
&gt;  
&gt;It bases the ""points of differential"" based on the number of students of that race receiving that punishment vs the actual population of the school.  
&gt;  
&gt;All this is showing is that black children commit crimes worthy of punishment at a rate that is higher then white people.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is propaganda.

The same occurs here. You reject what you don't like. I mean, you argue it's manipulative... even though it acknowledges “disparities in student discipline such as those presented in this figure may support a finding of discrimination, but taken alone, do not establish whether unlawful discrimination has occurred.”  So, your counter-point... is acknowledged and downright, mentioned. It sure seems like you stopped reading when you didn't like its findings.Of course, the source has more information. The source shows studies where black girls are regarded as less ""innocent"" than white girls, a disadvantage they face that will lead to them being harshly disciplined. Then, we have another source, showing the same is true for black boys. If these children are viewed as more guilty due to their race, that's pretty clear discrimination.

&gt;This doesn't actually tackle school quality, its actually tackling culture and racial differences in how families raise their children.  
&gt;  
&gt;Its the core of my position tbh and it actually adds weight to my position. White families have more of an interest in seeing their children succeed scholastically and spend more time teaching their children basic educational information before they hit the school system. This is supported by the data you linked.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes, some of this may have something to do with the fact that white people earn more money etc etc; however I think it has a LOT more to do with the fatherless household issue within black communities and a lack of a focus on the black culture on raising strong children and strong families.

That's just not true. A few excerpts.  ""But black children are much more likely than white children to be enrolled in low-quality day care."" So, lower quality schooling at a young age, that's shown. "" Black students are more likely to be held back, despite mounting research showing that holding back children doesn’t benefit them socially or academically and makes them more likely to drop out later on."" Further evidence that they're treated in a manner that isn't beneficial to them. "" On average, schools serving more minority populations have less-experienced, lower-paid teachers who are less likely to be certified. "" Once again, dealing with school quality, black students are disadvantaged. So, the evidence shows that a lot of disadvantages stem from education.

&gt;Great. So even among those that explicitly reject prejudice it still exists.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefor its not something that we can adjust for and we are literally ghost hunting.  
&gt;  
&gt;If even those who are explicitly and willfully attempt to act in a way that is not prejudice and biased, and STILL act in that way; then its literal ghost hunting.

No it isn't, don't be ludicrous. This tells us that even people who don't consider themselves racist are proven to be biased against black people. It's a bias that disadvantages black students, yet again shown to be true. Someone believing something doesn't mean they act in the appropriate way. This speaks far more to how disadvantaged black people are by bias, not less. 

&gt;First source behind a paywall, immediately dismissed.

How illogical. Another continued rejection of scientific research... because you don't think we should pay for research? How on earth do you expect it to be done?

&gt;Reading the second source which goes on to great lengths but I can summarize the argument which is implicit racial bias in the medical system. As I said unless you're capable of showing me legitimate policies, actions, people, or situations which are racially biased (such as affirmative action) all we are doing is ghost hunting and trying to use implicit unintentional bias/prejudice to try to argue for actual active racist policies.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that if these doctors are doing this unintentionally and without malice, then we need to understand the base source of why its happening and try to figure out why. We can't use these as a reason why we need to implement another racist policy in order to magically make things right by discriminating against others.

Unintentionally disadvantaging someone still disadvantages them, my man. If your argument is ""Well, black people are disadvantaged, but a lot of the times we're doing it by accident!""... you're still agreeing they're disadvantaged. So, medical bias is proven, but you want to ignore its effects. 

&gt;No, it absolutely can be ignored. There is no reason to consider someones race in determining how they were discriminated against. 

Sure there is. We've proven black students are disadvantaged... and you just want to ignore that. It's not insulting that a kid doesn't get into college because he wasn't good enough when taking into account discrimination and privilege. Its far more insulting to tell a kid ""Well, we know you were disadvantaged and without that disadvantage you would've got in, but I don't take about the disadvantages you faced so... we'll give it to someone inherently with less merit than you.""

&gt;You haven't demonstrated ""more potential"" all that you've demonstrated is that you're a shittier carpenter at the time of application.  
&gt;  
&gt;The teacher/master doesn't care that the pupil had a rough childhood, all he cares about is the quality of the applicant applying. The merit and skill of the person applying.  
&gt;  
&gt;When your argument is ""well, he had additional training and he is better at the task he is applying for""  
&gt;  
&gt;THEN HE SHOULD GET THE POSITION

Don't be silly. Someone's inherent merit isn't increased because of advantages. The black students who are disadvantaged will, by definition, have worse results than those of the same and lesser merit. Those students of lesser merit shouldn't get in because they happened to have advantages.

&gt;You haven't proven fuckin anything. Black people are disadvantaged because they mostly live in broken households, in crime and poverty ridden areas, with a shitty culture that doesn't outwardly shame crime and instead embraces it. That isn't inherent racism, its bad culture and families. 

Untrue. We've proven so far that they're disadvantaged medically, through bias, both conscious and subconscious, and that they're sent to worse schools and treated worse in said schools. All of that has been shown, you just seem to want to ignore it."
144,e5u33c3,"&gt; The guy opened the door FTFY. She would have shot whoever opened the door.

Wait, how do you know she would have shot whoever opened it? It's a fact that black men are read as dangerous in a way other men and women aren't. I guarantee if a white woman opened that door Amber Guyger would have taken a step back and thought about what's going on. It's only black people, especially black men, who frighten people by their very existence. 

This is why it's dangerous for black people to seek help. The young black boy in Michigan who was shot at because he went to a neighbor's door to ask directions. The black woman killed because she was in an accident, knocked for help, and the white man shot her through the door (also Michigan). The black man who got into an accident, knocked on a white woman's door for help, she called the cops and the cops pulled up and shot him as he ran to them for help (North Carolina).

Nah, black men definitely don't get any benefit of any doubt and easily scare people. Black boys are assumed to be men so they're not safe either. "
145,fwqqtc7,"&gt;They hired probable war criminals to protect them as they proceed with whatever they pretend they're going to do.

They didn't hire them themselves, the city did because they got death threats. When public figures get death threats, cities either use their own police or hire security to protect the individuals receiving death threats. That's not a new thing. Not sure why you are trying to make it into a thing it isn't, nor what you think them being war criminals reflects on the situation. No shit security companies are shady, so are the police? what's your point?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And the Palestinian grocer whose store was burnt down for calling the police about the counterfeit 20 will never be able to afford the same whenever they get death threats and Linda Sarsour can't redirect blame to underage black girls.

Are you saying they are receiving continuous death threats?  I'm not trying to make a political point here, these are just factual things that you misrepresent. It's certainly not good that the store was burnt down, but lets not pretend that protecting a person after they receive death threats is the same thing as preventing a spontaneous riot from burning down a particular individual's property."
146,fzopb29,"""We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure.""

That is *literally* mom, dad and the kids. The only way you ""disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family"" is by promoting single parent households. It doesn't matter if their happy ol' idea of a ""community upbringing"" is goodhearted - the problem is that young black boys are growing up without a father around to be their role model. Then when they're teenagers, instead of looking up to dad and wanting to be like him, they look up to the gangbangers on the corner and try and emulate them. Next thing you know, they're some gang's disposable soldier and that's a short road to prison or death. Then if that young man has any of his own kids, it's just damning the cycle to repeat itself again.

It's so hard for a young man without a strong role model to grow up to be a *good* man. So many of these problems; the gangs, the drugs, the violence, the broken families, even prejudice and police brutality can be positively affected by black men sticking around to raise their sons."

Can't have your cake and eat it too. 

2) Nothing leading up to the point signaled that he would resist (your phrasing is quite leading) but, once again: Perhaps if the first responder weren't an armed person trained in force, from an institution that black boys are taught to fear because of the real life consequences of being black, and especially poor/working class then Mr. Brooks is likely still alive.

3) see reply #1 and the literature/framing of the manufacturer of the 'deadly weapin' that posed such a ""grave threat"" to the lives of the responding officers.

4) Dude, you ever been pulled over while black? have you been watching the news?  they don't have to do anything to elicit fear. The fear is there when every night we get to see new images of police assaulting the population indiscriminately. The fear is there because there is an open contest to the legitimacy of police , that isn't lost on people and it's completely different scenario being questioned and being handcuffed as a poor or working class black man. The fear is there because our grandparents lived through Jim Crow and watched as the law was weaponized against us in a far more open way than it is now, that lesson gets passed down through the generations. It's the reason that most black people I know got the lesson to 'never leave home without ID'. 


His life, as far as he figured (I figure), was over either financially or literally right then and there considering the pernicious nature of our legal system when it comes to the poor and black populations. On some unconscious level that is a calculus that plays out for those who are taken in and the police are not unaware of that. that neighborhood is rough and underdeveloped  and the national mood being what it is should all have been indicators. The trained law enforcement officers not being prepared to 'enforce the law' is no excuse but an indictment.

5) The scale is lesser, sure. But the implications are insidious. Further The issue of excessive force is immediately actionable, while ending drunk driving requires a cultural and ""moral shift"" among other things. Considering the implications of a person from an institution born of slave patrols, who've historically used their force to subjugate black communities and communities in general that challenge the established order All lead to this moment in time: where the nature of how we are policed is being but into question and must reestablish their validity. So far our police forces, and elected leaders on the whole, are not answering the bell.

I'm not sure you can reform an institution with such a background (as the watchdogs for the powerful &amp; the propertied) and with each day of police crackdowns and each new video of excessive force that lead to firings and charges that would have never happened without said video, often by bystanders or acquired through tireless legal advocation, and especially with each objection to community oversight/cooperation by police forces and unions. We can do better, we have no reason to cling to policing as we know it just because it's how we know it. It just takes a bit of courage, imagination and a willingness to learn from the past failures instead of clasping to what is for its own sake.

Women’s bodily autonomy is constantly under attack which is something you don’t have to deal with. And this can lead to mental and physical health issues, financial issues, loss of careers and freedom and sometimes even death. And this is more likely to affect black women that white women. 

Black LGBTQIA+ women are more likely to be murdered or attacked or raped than white LGBTQIA+ women or any LGBTQIA+ men. 

Black women are still subjected to domestic slavery much more than whites women due to domestic violence and lack of options due to low socio economic status and this domestic slavery is not something that men have to face. 

I know that as a black man you are often assumed dangerous or guilty of crimes just because you’re black. But so are black women but it manifests in different ways.

To see why this is no defense, we can think about it in a slightly different context. Let’s say a judge is deciding how much bail to set for defendants, and needs to judge their risk of committing additional crimes. The judge comes up with a series of criteria that are statistically correlated with higher crime rates: criminal record, age, marital status, neighborhood of residence, income, gender, race. And he sets bail accordingly. This means that, all other things equal, a black defendant will be considered riskier to release than a white one, and will be given a higher bail amount solely because of his race. (Being a male will also be punished, and so will being poor.) If we define “racial prejudice” as assuming that someone is more likely to have some kind of negative characteristic, solely because of their race, we haven’t proven that this isn’t racist merely because there are additional variables used in the bail-setting process.

Harris is quick to call profiling opponents crazy, dishonest, and dangerous. But he doesn’t really understand their argument. The argument (at least in its sophisticated variety, which is the one that should be addressed) is that even when the statistical correlations he’s talking about do exist, building a security regime on the basis of them builds racial prejudice formally into the law and is socially harmful. One left objection to “stop-and-frisk” policies that target young African Americans, for instance, is that they do not yield results. But a more important objection is that even if they did yield results, encouraging police to stereotype all young black men as more likely to be criminals creates an intolerable situation for those who are not criminals. It means that any given black teenager, however law-abiding, must go through the world imprisoned by his race, constantly suffering suspicion and negative stigma. There will be a “black” penalty in bail-setting, a black penalty in every police encounter, a black penalty in the attitudes of shopkeepers, and in every other aspect of life. The serious arguments against profiling are about what it does to us, and what its social effects will be. But Harris feels justified in dismissing the left as wilfully oblivious even as he refuses to deal with the most basic rational objections to his proposal.”

&gt;You also took his other statement out of context. He isn't staying we should nuke Muslims. He said that if a jihadi group gets their hands on a nuke, that may be the only option available to us.

He didn’t specify “jihadi group” he said an “Islamist regime” which wouldn’t adhere to “deterrence logic.” Which could mean anything given that we are supposedly “at war with Islam” the same Islam that is taught to “all Muslims in the Koran.” Don’t you see how maybe saying we’re at war with Islam and calling it a “death cult,” a “pestilential theology” where moderate Muslims “scarcely exist” (all of those are direct quotes from The End of Faith) on the one hand and additionally saying that if a radical regime got a nuke we should nuke it first on the other is troubling? His rhetoric is essentially that deadly, extremist regimes would have to be nuked, but also that most Muslims are deadly extremists.

&gt;No, it's not. Religion is shitty. All religions are untrue mythological stories. There is no Zeus. There is no God. These stories hold humanity back and inject a dimension into our thought processes that are counter-productive to everything we want the world to be.

I can agree that religions are untrue and do shitty things and not use needless hyperbole to assume everyone in them is in a death cult. And that’s coming from someone raised in a fundamentalist envrionment.

&gt;Conceded. But I am ok with profiling. Facts are facts. 4 year old black girls are not blowing up airplanes or taking people hostage. White men and muslims are.

Congrats, you’re advocating for the law to explicitly racist policy into the law. Which, as my prior quote points out, is shitty. If your defense of Harris’ racist positions is to agree whole heartedly and advocate raciakized policing, then there’s nothing left to argue. Calling me out for misunderstanding or not knowing about Harris was pointless, since everything I’ve said about him, including that he was a racist, is actually true."
156,ek4vauq,"There’s a massive culture difference in circumcision. I had a quick snip when I was barely a week old. Jewish boys have it done when they’re what? 11 or 12? And in South Africa, where I live, young African boys are “taken to the mountain” as it’s known, they stand in a line, and an older male uses a knife or scissors to do it. 

That last practice is heavily frowned upon cause of infection, pain, and sometimes death. 

Really just depends on which walk of life it happens in. "
157,emysc7a,"Ex CO here yet again! Some stereotypes I thought I'd share. The big muscular scary looking black guys are very nice to officers and many of them just want to pass their time and get out peacefully. They're usually quite helpful with chores too. The younger light skinned black guys weren't aggressive towards officers but they did try to steal from us and convince us to get them things they couldn't get on the inside. They were very sneaky. The worst ones were the skinny white guys. Those are the inmates you always had to watch out for. I caught a white dude with face tattoos smoking a cigarette and I told him he can't do that and he held the cigarette right in my face then continued smoking without speaking to me. I pretty much just said fuck it my life is more important than this job so I let him smoke. The young dark skinned black boys are very easy to talk to and nice but they try to act tougher than they are I feel. A lot of them seemed depressed and they had good reason to be. Many of the young black guys were in gangs and got caught up in gang violence and lost their entire futures because of it. It's such a waste. One young man was very good at making crosses and jewelry out of cloth and he was arrested at age 16 for triple homicide, charged as an adult, and sentenced to life without parole. Another stereotype is that death row inmates are the worst in the prison but that is false too. They were actually the easiest to work with and they were very nice and respectful. Almost all of them were older white men late 50s I think. Where worked the showers were open showers so rapes didn't really happen at the showers. Oh also the Mexicans that were in there were very smart, funny, and crafty. I saw a Mexican man make wine in the back of a toilet and boil ramen with the heat from wires connected to an outlet in his cell. I think there was only 1 asian there but he got along with everybody and was transferred out quick."
158,ehuo2m0,"Racism isn’t racism and that’s extremely dangerous to say, this woman is having her feelings hurt and her living with fear of people saying bad words to her.

Black folks live with fear of DEATH, less jobs, less pay, worse schooling, etc etc, I’m not saying that what these black girls are doing is right because it’s downright horrible and they need to be removed from that room, but do not equate all racism with each other because one of prejudice and the other is systemic. "
159,ejavvyr,"I love this theory. He got stuck in the closet the year before, and the Dad says he's had a hard time this past year with his grandmother's death... this is an excellent theory.

&amp;#x200B;

It also explains why he isn't as shocked or upset as he should be by what he saw on the beach. More like curious/confused.

&amp;#x200B;

I also like how the boy is the one particularly at risk. Black boys are most at risk for being arrested and thrown into the prison system. It makes sense that he's the one in the family who was trapped in the tunnel."
160,eeq8jvh,"&gt; These kids had the wherewithal to march for a pro-life agenda

A lot of leaps here. They go to a Catholic school and they went on a school field trip, which is fun and exciting. Catholics are against abortion. This isn't complicated. What, are they going to say no, and not go to the capitol with their friends? Absurd. These kids aren't writing Ben Shapiro essays about why abortion is bad. They are 14 and 15. On a field trip. Were you totally squared away and ultra-conscientious at 14? Me neither. I was a political nincompoop, as I should have been. 

See? We can both play this game. The truth is neither of us knows because we don't live inside their minds. 

I could also write a whole essay on why white teen boys might be attracted to the troll-in-chief for reasons that have nothing to do with racism; how he's the 4-chan president and 4-chan is populated by teenage boys, etc. But I'll spare you. And that's too complicated for 2018 internet anyway. Around here, we go from zero  to 'that's undeniably racist' in the blink of an eye. I could also invoke Dave Chappel's *How old is 15, really* bit, except this time it's reversed. This time the 15-year-old target is white, apparently a full adult, and certainly old enough to be tried and convicted as an adult in the court of public opinion. Apropos Chappel: Fifteen year old white girl victims are innocent and barely capable of agency, but MAGA white boys are adults good for a face punch (plus some death threats on the side), and black boys are good to get locked up for life. 

What a goddamned mess. "
161,efwwup9,"Do we all have the same opportunities when judges give black people longer sentences than white people for the same crime, the same severity, and the came record? When cops are more likely to stop black people and search them for drugs even though white people are more likely to do drugs? When teachers are more likely to punish or expel black students for the same patterns of misbehavior as white students? When black people are more likely to get the death penalty? When black people with darker skin are *even more likely* to get the death penalty? When black people with darker skin are more likely to be judged as unintelligent? When young black boys are considered older and less innocent than young white boys? When black people are perceived as feeling less pain? When black names receive fewer responses to their resume? When black home buyers get worse loans for the same qualifications? When they get shown fewer properties?

Is that what you call the same opportunity?"
162,e4wzs2x,"Ya might wanna buckle up, buddy.

Lemme give you a bit of history of the term ""Jezebel"". This term goes all the way back to the times before and during slavery, when white Europeans settlers encountered African tribeswomen. The tribeswomen often walked around topless, and the Europeans assumed that this was because they partook in sex a lot. When African women were brought over as slaves, not only were they worked to death, they were even raped by their masters, because they not only wanted more slaves, they believed the female slaves liked it. The master's wife would get pissed because she believe the female slave ""seduced"" him. As such, the female slave would get mercilessly beaten, starved, whipped, and tortured. For being raped. For something that wasn't her fault.

Because of this stereotype, us black women are seen as sexually deviant/hypersexual, controlling, and masculine (due to our perceived high sex drive, which is ""matched"" with that of a guy's). Because of this stereotype, when a black woman is sexually assaulted, people tend to brush it off, vilify us when it happens, and say that it's our fault because we're ""sexual in nature"".


What's even sadder is that, by the age of 5, young black girls are seen as being less innocent than their white counterparts.


The term ""negress"" is a an outdated, yet deragatory slur used to describe a black woman.


I decided to take both terms and make them into my flair as a bit of a joke and a personal jab towards women (and some men) in the alt-right who believe that us black girls and black women are out to ""steal their men"" . 

And, as a little tidbit, I also have a preference for white guys, but I'll be damned if I encounter one who's a neo-Nazi. I'll be double damned if he tries to initiate any sort of relationship with me, for the sole purpose of subjugating me based on my race and and gender.

Anyway, there you have it! The not-so-fun history of what my flair really means. "
163,e6v2pnx,"I believe the point was that Republicans have already brought race into it. They are very quick to call a white grown man a “boy,” worry about ruining his life, and talk about his potential. Meanwhile, children of color (especially but not exclusively black boys) are considered dangerous adults long before their 18th birthdays. Remember when Trump called for the death penalty for the Central Park Five?

No one is saying that these rapist pieces of shit are even worse because they are white. They’re just pointing out that G.O.P. has all the patience and forgiveness in the world for white men, while men of color are not afforded the same treatment."
164,e2cngb7,"You showed up for a real discussion. Cool, I'll play.

No, I don't think it's pathetic. I think some people are kinky as all hell and that it's none of my business. You wagging your finger at her will likely just turn her on. Kind of like when men are assholes to me about this that or the other and I'm getting that primo **** from someone they would hate. The spite is delightful.  Don't be so invested. You can't save everybody.

A small amount of White women calling some guy BBC?  Friend.  White people as a collective are now on this BBC train.  Look at the porn stats to get a real understanding on the numbers. And I used to think this was dehumanizing for Black men til enough of them decided to ADVERTISE themselves as such.  If you yourself maintain your dignity, I support it but make no mistake. This isn't just a few White girls curious about BBC.

&gt; Raceplay like this validates and justifies the racism that has pervaded this society for half a millennia, exacerbating a slowly diminish problem

It's sex between two consesual adults. You can't lecture people out of their kinks. You will only exacerbate it.  As someone with a White guy, I don't do raceplay but the dominance is unspeakable. You know why? He doesn't make me feel like shit outside of sex. Doesn't ""females"" this or ""bitch"" that. He doesn't make dehumanizing me a norm. And that feels like power to me.  I don't need the name calling. But I love the power dynamic. 
I wanted that with BLACK men but the type of Black men I would ever be interested in are only into being BBC for white girls. I hold no hate. I found what worked for me.  I no longer look to you guys to lead. Those of you who are friends have my support but my love, from the streets to the bedroom, I don't care about how it feels to the black male collective anymore. I don't say that to be offensive. It's just my reality. It is why when I see the pic in the OP, I shrug. Indifference. It's not like those of you who don't like it would woo her and make sweet love or give hot sex that doesn't take her humanity away. So?  Who cares?

&gt; But I'm sure you don't care, worst case scenario if this stuff goes back to the way it was you'll juts be some white chads monkey fuck toy while the black guy would be lynched

This was a ghastly, ugly, hateful thing for you as a black man to say to me. And it is why I feel safer with ""Chad"" than with you.


&gt; Arguing out of apathy makes it impossible to extrapolate actual pragmatic solutions because society just deteriorates/stagnates if you're so faux-nonchalant about everything.

Men are supposed to be the leaders. Black men continue to fail to lead. So I will not make my bedroom some political forum. Even if I did, many of you wouldn't care to build a house and home with me.  Sorry, this is a tactic for my aunts, mom, her mom, and the women before. This is the new Do You generation.

&gt;  Being pro this raceplay bull shit just validates racist white dudes and feeds in to women of color inferiority complexes. It's harmful.

I'm not pro this raceplay. I simply don't care. And I get how this can be extremely hot for someone with more apathy or disdain in her heart. 

I don't exclude Black men from my dating pool. But I do not play affirmative action with my pussy.  The man I am with is one who inspires respect, protects me, loves me, laughs with me, and does not nag me to death so that the hot sex between us is prudish and lame.  If this is how this girl gets it? All the power to you.  I bet you do not coral Black men and lecture them about decades of telling the world how trash Black girls are or how much prettier we are with certain features, color, and hair.

Don't confuse my apathy for being anti black. I just choose to live and be happy about it.  Whenever you guys want to show up for us, you know Black women come together on code.  But you don't. So do not get angry with us for taking good dick, whatever color it may be. 

Please and thank you.






"
165,e2cu85r,"&gt;No, I don't think it's pathetic. I think some people are kinky as all hell and that it's none of my business. 

Again, doesn't remove them from criticism.

&gt;You wagging your finger at her will likely just turn her on

Self hating PoC women will fuck racist white chad no matter what. I'm at least going to call them on it.

&gt;Kind of like when men are assholes to me about this that or the other and I'm getting that primo **** from someone they would hate. 

That's the point. **You're** supposed to hate them. They're calling you the nigger, not me. But because these women are pathetic servile trash they thrive off of it.

&gt;A small amount of White women calling some guy BBC? Friend. White people as a collective are now on this BBC train. Look at the porn stats to get a real understanding on the numbers. And I used to think this was dehumanizing for Black men til enough of them decided to ADVERTISE themselves as such. If you yourself maintain your dignity, I support it but make no mistake. This isn't just a few White girls curious about BBC.

Statistics say otherwise. In any sense it's a bit point. They aren't calling black girls BBB Big Black Boobs, emphasizing their femininity, they're callining them niggers, and other slurs.

&gt;It's sex between two consesual adults. You can't lecture people out of their kinks. You will only exacerbate it. 

And shaming murders and rapists probably does similar, doesn't mean it's not right to want to criticize it. Consenting doesn't preclude impact on society as a whole, whats it with millennial and this consent=nothing harmful will ever result of it whatsoever thing.

&gt;As someone with a White guy

Everytime.

&gt;He doesn't make me feel like shit outside of sex. Doesn't ""females"" this or ""bitch"" that. 

Neither do most people. But wait until he's behind close doors, I've heard enough locker room talk from men in Wm/bf

&gt; wanted that with BLACK men but the type of Black men I would ever be interested in are only into being BBC for white girls. 

No men *only* chase a certain type of girl. Those white girls approached and chased those black guys, you didn't. Unlike men, if women pursue a guy she will get him to some extent.


&gt;It is why when I see the pic in the OP, I shrug. Indifference. It's not like those of you who don't like it would woo her and make sweet love or give hot sex that doesn't take her humanity away. So? Who cares?

The point is she chose to be with a vile racist as opposed to anyone else because the racist was white. It's pathetic and perpetuates racism through validation. ""Hey racist white guys, even if you literally call black girls niggers they'll just acquiesce like good little slaves! No consequences!""

&gt;This was a ghastly, ugly, hateful thing for you as a black man to say to me. And it is why I feel safer with ""Chad"" than with you.

Lmao nice posthoc justification. I literally just summarized the last several centuries of racialized sexual history between whites and blacks in America and that was apparently ghastly, hateful etc. You know who did those things? Yeah, (racist)white dudes, not black men. Stop trying to irrationally justify your white worship, please. 

&gt;Men are supposed to be the leaders. Black men continue to fail to lead. 

Nice racism.

&gt;Even if I did, many of you wouldn't care to build a house and home with me

That's literally my dream, but so many self-hating white worshipping black/mixed women make that impossible. 

&gt;This is the new Do You generation.

Which is exactly why the rise in Nazism and reactionary ideologies is making a return. Yeah, ""Do you"", back into subjugation. I'm sure the white dude you're with will be so different then the white guy in the OP and the vast majority of white guys during and since colonialism.

&gt;I'm not pro this raceplay. I simply don't care.

And you should.

&gt;The man I am with is one who inspires respect, protects me, loves me, laughs with me, and does not nag me to death so that the hot sex between us is prudish and lame.

And it's just so (not) funny how to girls like these it's always white guys. Not asian, latin, arab, etc, always white. Hmm...

&gt; I bet you do not coral Black men and lecture them about decades of telling the world how trash Black girls are or how much prettier we are with certain features, color, and hair.

Because they haven't. White men have for over a century. The first black women millionaire did so through hair straightening solutions, elicited by racists whites shaming their slaves into looking more white. Whites have done this to both males and females of our race since the 1800s, just because some black guys fall into it recently doesn't remove the primary progenitors of this. To this day, black women are often the least selected in dating apps by white men because **they** have been and currently doing the whole ""black women are gross thing"". I've seen white incels on this very board say stuff like this while I haven't seen a single blackcel say such things.

&gt;Don't confuse my apathy for being anti black. I just choose to live and be happy about it.

I was just talking with another black/mixed women who is in an almost exactly similar position as you. Black girl with a white guy saying black men as whole never meet their ""standards"", only talking in brief sentences but going on super long spiels because I hit a nerve, that they aren't self hating and white worshiping, etc. While I believe everything else is true, I don't believe you are anti-black/selfhating. Which is why I think this discussion is going much better than the one with her. But your apathy towards stuff like this supports, self-hating/internalized anti-blackness in PoC women. 

You don't have to call her names, but a simple, ""That guy is trash, You can do better for yourself"" could work wonders.

&gt; But you don't.

What do you mean?

The United States, far and away, has the largest prison population in the world. It also has one of the greatest disparities in their prison population of ethnic minorities in the world. How does a country that prides itself on being a “beacon of freedom” and whose leaders travel the world scolding other countries on “human rights” find itself to be the largest carceral state of the 21st century? 
What are the cultural forces that reinforce racist attitudes, deference to the police and prosecutors, and a belief that 7 million people – or, the equivalent population of Washington DC, Vermont, North Dakota, Alaska, South Dakota, Delaware, Montana, and Rhode Island – all belong in cages or on parole or prohibition.

For this show – recorded live in Brooklyn, NY on May 25, 2018 – we will follow a hypothetical ""defendant,"" the median being an African-American in their early 20's, from birth to the time they sit in front of a judge and, at each point, examine how the media stacks the deck against them. We cover this in five parts, each representing different moments in this chain of events - Birth, Childhood, Adolescence, the Arrest and the Plea – and show how the media conspires to make a not guilty verdict all but impossible. 

We are joined by Rachel Foran and Naila Siddiqui of Court Watch NYC.

167,e2f7s1z,"We should. Affirmative action is one small measure to help our country and its long history of slavery, oppression, racism and bias toward that goal. 

But as of right now there is still a significant income gap, employment gap and education gap. Black-sounding names are less likely to receive calls on job applications with otherwise equal qualifications. Black children (specifically black boys) are more likely to receive harsh punishments in school. And black men are more likely to end up in prison, even for things like marijuana possession when the usage rates are similar to that of white men. 

So, either black people are inherently predisposed to being unemployable, poor, uneducated criminals, or a country that called them property, denied their right to vote, refused to share drinking fountains, restaurants and schools with them, and failed to prosecute white people who beat innocent black people to death in the streets for 75% of its history somehow still has a long way to go toward leveling the playing field.

169,drpi2jb,"I feel thoroughly sorry for your children and to a certain degree for your partner.

I was referencing this comment of yours:

&gt; White dude married to a black girl for like ten years now. This is a weird topic for me that I've given lots of thought to over the years. I absolutely love my wife more because she's black. I think black girls are sexy as fuck. Is that a fetish? Sure. 

Your two ""half-black kids"" whom you ""love to death""- how do you reckon they would feel seeing their father make a ""joke"" about them being mixed-race abominations?

It's not a matter of opinion- you're disgusting. "
170,dql1xpb,"&gt;""We have been in this nigger-fighting business now for twenty-three days, and have been under fire for the greater part of that time. The niggers shoot over one another's heads or any old way. Even while I am writing this the black boys are banging away at our outposts, but they very seldom hit anybody. The morning of the 6th a burying detail from our regiment buried forty-nine nigger enlisted men and two nigger officers, and when we stopped chasing them the night before, we could see 'em carrying a great many with them. We are supposed to have killed about three hundred. Take my advice, and don't enlist in the regulars, for you are good for three years. I am not sorry I enlisted, but you see we have had some excitement and we only have about fourteen months' time to serve, if they keep us our full time, which is not likely. We will, no doubt, start home as soon as we get these niggers rounded up.""


&gt;""When we got in the woods maybe we didn't strike a hornet's nest. I never stood such a hot fire, but we kept right on, and killed fifty-two of them, while about three hundred got away. Pretty good, wasn't it, for about sixty men? ... They sent four companies to reinforce us, but they could not catch us, as our blood was up, and we wanted revenge for poor _______'s death. The men were just crazy. I got three of them. We had one man killed and five wounded. Soon we had orders to advance, and we rose up from behind our trenches and started across the creek in mud and water up to our waists. However, we did not mind it a bit, our fighting blood was up and we all wanted to kill 'niggers.' This shooting human beings is a 'hot game,' and beats rabbit hunting all to pieces.... We soon charged them again, and such a slaughter you never saw. We killed them like rabbits; hundreds, yes, thousands of them. Every one was crazy. I tell you it was awful after it was over. But it was war.... We will soon round them up and kill them all off. No more prisoners. They take none, and they torture our men, so we will kill wounded and all of them.... The weather is intensely hot, and we are all tired, dirty, and hungry, so we have to kill niggers whenever we have a chance, to get even for all our trouble.""

&gt;""This war is something terrible. You see sights you could hardly believe, and a life is hardly worth a thought. I have seen a shell from our artillery strike a bunch of Filipinos, and then they would go scattering through the air, legs, arms, heads, all disconnected. And such sights actually make our boys laugh and yell, 'That shot was a peach.' A white man seems to forget that he is human.... Hasty intrenchments were thrown up to protect our troops from this fire, the bodies of many slain Filipinos being used as a foundation for this purpose, intrenching tools being scarce. Other bodies were thrown into the deep cuts across the road, and with a little top dressing of dirt made a good road again for the Hotchkiss gun serving with the left wing to advance to a position commanding the bridge, where the regiment was to force a crossing in the morning. Many other bodies were thrown into the trenches and covered with dirt, while others, scattered about in the woods and fields over which the battle-line swept, still remain unburied.""

&gt;""The town of Titatia was surrendered to us a few days ago, and two companies occupy the same. Last night one of our boys was found shot and his stomach cut open. Immediately orders were received from General Wheaton to burn the town and kill every native in sight, which was done to a finish. About one thousand men, women, and children were reported killed. I am probably growing hard-hearted, for I am in my glory when I can sight my gun on some dark-skin and pull the trigger. Let me advise you a little, and should a call for volunteers be made for this place, do not be so patriotic as to come here. Tell all my inquiring friends that I am doing everything I can for Old Glory and for America I love so well.""

&gt;""When you can realize four hundred or five hundred persons living within the confines of five or six blocks, and then an order calling out all of the women and children, and then setting fire to houses and shooting down any niggers attempting to escape from the flames, you have an idea of Filipino warfare.""

"
171,dqtt3bw,"&gt;  Do you honestly believe that red states just discriminate and oppress other races and ethnicities?

Yes. Alabama recently passed a law requiring an ID to vote. Then shut down the DMVs in predominately black counties while not closing them in predominately white counties.

Here's a selection from the laundry list from [here](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2010/07/26/fourteen-examples-systemic-racism-us-criminal-justice-system):

One. The US has seen a surge in arrests and putting people in jail over the last four decades. Most of the reason is the war on drugs. Yet whites and blacks engage in drug offenses, possession and sales, at roughly comparable rates – according to a report on race and drug enforcement published by Human Rights Watch in May 2008. While African Americans comprise 13% of the US population and 14% of monthly drug users they are 37% of the people arrested for drug offenses – according to 2009 Congressional testimony by Marc Mauer of The Sentencing Project.

Three. Since 1970, drug arrests have skyrocketed rising from 320,000 to close to 1.6 million according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the U.S. Department of Justice. African Americans are arrested for drug offenses at rates 2 to 11 times higher than the rate for whites – according to a May 2009 report on disparity in drug arrests by Human Rights Watch.

Four. Once arrested, blacks are more likely to remain in prison awaiting trial than whites. For example, the New York state division of criminal justice did a 1995 review of disparities in processing felony arrests and found that in some parts of New York blacks are 33% more likely to be detained awaiting felony trials than whites facing felony trials.

Five. Once arrested, 80% of the people in the criminal justice system get a public defender for their lawyer. Race plays a big role here as well. Stop in any urban courtroom and look a the color of the people who are waiting for public defenders. Despite often heroic efforts by public defenders the system gives them much more work and much less money than the prosecution. The American Bar Association, not a radical bunch, reviewed the US public defender system in 2004 and concluded “All too often, defendants plead guilty, even if they are innocent, without really understanding their legal rights or what is occurring…The fundamental right to a lawyer that America assumes applies to everyone accused of criminal conduct effectively does not exist in practice for countless people across the US.”

Six. African Americans are frequently illegally excluded from criminal jury service according to a June 2010 study released by the Equal Justice Initiative. For example in Houston County, Alabama, 8 out of 10 African Americans qualified for jury service have been struck by prosecutors from serving on death penalty cases.

Seven. Trials are rare. Only 3 to 5 percent of criminal cases go to trial – the rest are plea bargained. Most African Americans defendants never get a trial. Most plea bargains consist of promise of a longer sentence if a person exercises their constitutional right to trial. As a result, people caught up in the system, as the American Bar Association points out, plead guilty even when innocent. Why? As one young man told me recently, “Who wouldn’t rather do three years for a crime they didn’t commit than risk twenty-five years for a crime they didn’t do?”

Eight. The U.S. Sentencing Commission reported in March 2010 that in the federal system black offenders receive sentences that are 10% longer than white offenders for the same crimes. Marc Mauer of the Sentencing Project reports African Americans are 21% more likely to receive mandatory minimum sentences than white defendants and 20% more like to be sentenced to prison than white drug defendants.

Nine. The longer the sentence, the more likely it is that non-white people will be the ones getting it. A July 2009 report by the Sentencing Project found that two-thirds of the people in the US with life sentences are non-white. In New York, it is 83%.

Ten. As a result, African Americans, who are 13% of the population and 14% of drug users, are not only 37% of the people arrested for drugs but 56% of the people in state prisons for drug offenses. Marc Mauer May 2009 Congressional Testimony for The Sentencing Project.

Eleven. The US Bureau of Justice Statistics concludes that the chance of a black male born in 2001 of going to jail is 32% or 1 in three. Latino males have a 17% chance and white males have a 6% chance. Thus black boys are five times and Latino boys nearly three times as likely as white boys to go to jail.

Twelve. So, while African American juvenile youth is but 16% of the population, they are 28% of juvenile arrests, 37% of the youth in juvenile jails and 58% of the youth sent to adult prisons. 2009 Criminal Justice Primer, The Sentencing Project.

Thirteen. Remember that the US leads the world in putting our own people into jail and prison. The New York Times reported in 2008 that the US has five percent of the world’s population but a quarter of the world’s prisoners, over 2.3 million people behind bars, dwarfing other nations. The US rate of incarceration is five to eight times higher than other highly developed countries and black males are the largest percentage of inmates according to ABC News.

Fourteen. Even when released from prison, race continues to dominate. A study by Professor Devah Pager of the University of Wisconsin found that 17% of white job applicants with criminal records received call backs from employers while only 5% of black job applicants with criminal records received call backs. Race is so prominent in that study that whites with criminal records actually received better treatment than blacks without criminal records! "
172,dkjagzr,Homicide is a major cause of death for all babies. It kills about as many boys as cancer but black boys are about 3 times as likely to be killed by homicide as cancer. Maybe that means the death rate is just much lower than typical but I suspect the homicide rate is just much higher.
173,dibtsui,Well it's nice to see some commentary but let's see equal representation when a crime is committed. From what we have seen lately you can stab people to death and get calmly talked to while police ask you nicely to put down your weapon. Meanwhile black boys are being killed without judge or jury. 
174,dq64g69,"I could have asshole molester neighbors, or crackhead neighbors, or methhead neighbors that break in and steal my shit and kill me.  Or ones that poison my livestock.  No, I will take my racist neighbors, that are good to my family and help in a community setting, nearly like the Amish.

We are so isolated out here, neighbors are all we got.  If you are an ""urban dweller"" I bet you can't comprehend, but out here, we do shit together and help one another.   So they are racist?  I don't give a f-ck.   

My great Grand-mother was born in 1895,  I love her because she raised me, and she was born and raised in Michigan but from a  different time.  She was racist as f-ck.   It doesn't mean I am not going to love her.  

It's how people are raised and what they are taught.  I grew up watching Fat Albert, Different Strokes,  Facts of Life, the Jeffersons,  all sorts of shows in the 1970's and 1980's that encouraged people not to be racist.   

I'm not racist,  in fact I don't look at color at all.  It's a non-issue for me.   I base people on their actions and my experiences with them.   I have a young black man that lived with my family for a while and he calls me mom.   My daughter's best friend is a Mexican homosexual (FROM MEXICO MEXICAN), he also calls me mom. 

They are my friends and when they come to visit my neighbors treat them kindly and with respect. 

Racism goes two ways.  My daughter (who is white) was treated so poorly by black female co-workers in Detroit that she had to quit her job when she had no money and really needed it.   That's racism too.   It's not right, but those black girls are just as ignorant as my neighbors.   I assume that's all they know as well. "
175,fcy8zng,"I can also understand where you come from. It's awful when people are divided by their skin color and America has a nasty history of doing it and still does it today. I always tell people I wouldn't focus so much on our differences if I wasn't being shamed for who I am. I am natural which means I don't put relaxers or perm in my hair. Some people might find my hair and skin color ugly.

Here's what I look like: [https://imgur.com/a/NiQnkpm](https://imgur.com/a/NiQnkpm)

I'm not sure if you saw the comment where the person was basically trolling and stereotyping Black girls and women. They asked very rude question on things like why black girls are so ugly and why they stink as well as many other awful questions. I've seen posts on Reddit saying Black women are ugly. I've seen posts on Reddit saying negative things about Black people in general. I mostly ignore those cause I'm not going to waste my time fighting with ignorant people on the internet. I feel like it's important to study why people feel this way about Black people.

Black history may not be important to you and that's fine but it is important to me and many other Black people. It's helps us understand where we come from and how it impacts things in our lives today.

Edit: I also had a person a few hours ago DM me and they called me a African Hooligan lol."
176,evzdccb,"Yeah a lot of black girls are like that. Like of course I like black girls, but a lot black girls attitudes stink and it annoys me."
177,e3ypvyh,"Hahaha what the fuck.

I don't really fuck interracially, but that's mostly because I find black girls are pig ugly and stink of sweaty ballsack and fish. Asian girls - I just don't find slanty eyes and pasty skin attractive.

You do you bro, seems like if anything you're the one who's insecure."
178,fv9eud1,"&gt; verify your claim I can dig into the source?

Well, first off it isn't *my* claim. It was an independent review done by professionals within the Ministry of Education. The review was ordered by Education Minister Stephen Lecce (he's PC if that matters). 

As for the TLDR; This article did a good job highlighting the points:
https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2020/03/22/peel-school-board-report-leaves-readers-devastated-now-its-up-to-the-education-minister-to-fix.html

But, There's still a lot to take in here:

* Indigenous, Black and gay students are all over-represented in non-university courses and under-represented in academic courses and special enriched programs.
* “Too many educators and administrators do not have high expectations for Black students … and they are by no means encouraged to realize their potential,” the review says.
* It is untenable that the PDSB is unaware of this devaluing and “mis-tracking” of Black students, the review reports. “Information gleaned from the Board’s own data base discloses a prima facie case of race based, and more particularly, anti-Black, discrimination and it must be remedied.”
* One Black, “A” student reported waiting weeks for an appointment with a guidance counsellor, only to be given five minutes and told to take non-academic courses. “The PDSB guidance system must be rebuilt from the ground up to empower, as opposed to disenfranchise, Black students and parents,” says the review.
* Black students are “grossly over-represented in suspensions” as too many teachers and principals abandon progressive discipline and opt to remove Blacks from classes and involve police “for minor issues leading to arrests and stigmatization of Black children at a very young age.”
* Black stigmatization starts early. The reviewers heard of how a cop, at an elementary school for another matter, “intervened in a situation and handcuffed a young Black elementary student. It need not be said that the result was nothing short of traumatizing for the young student and their family. Unfortunately, this incident is not isolated.”
* The Ontario Human Rights Commission ruled last month that police discriminated against a Grade 1 PDSB student and “race was a factor in treatment by police when she was placed on her stomach and her wrists handcuffed behind her.”
* Some teachers “use any excuse” to exclude Black students from classes. Principals have suspended Black students for wearing hoodies, hoop earrings, and do rags.
* Worse, some principals remove Black kids from class, without suspension or expulsions, leaving them, as one vice-principal explained, to “spend days staring at a white wall not learning and parents never know about this de facto form of suspension.”
* “Repeatedly we heard about Black students being suspended from school, some as early as junior kindergarten,” or as young as four years old, the reviewers wrote. So they asked for suspension data.
* PDSB suspension data list 18 reasons for a suspension, including violence, drugs, vandalism, swearing, bullying, assault and uttering threats. The 18th reason is “Other.” Strangely, in 78 per cent of secondary school suspensions, the reason listed was “Other” — “a worrisome trend” of discretionary suspensions that need explanation, the review concludes.
* Between 2013 and 2019, the PDSB recorded 52 incidents of suspensions at the junior kindergarten level and 103 at the senior kindergarten level. Black secondary school students are suspended at a rate twice what their numbers would warrant.
* Black students told the reviewers they were often goaded into negative responses; and they experience harsher penalties and less restraint from their teachers, white and brown. Studies show Blacks, especially Black boys, are perceived to be trouble and are surveilled more closely, even when no problem behaviour is present.
* The stigmatization and hurts spring from everywhere – even from the school trustees entrusted with their growth.
* The report says “staff, students and families of McCrimmon Middle School and the Black communities of the PDSB deserve and are expecting an apology to address the hurt and harm” caused when Trustee Will Davies referred to the school as “McCriminal” and insisted he was only joking.
* Others in Peel relish other derogatory nicknames: “Ghetto Jail” and “Meadow Jail” for Meadowvale. “Central Africa” for Central Peel Secondary.
* One principal wanted to rename February “Fro-bruary” but was stopped by a Black colleague. And Black History Month is not universally embraced.
* Reviewers heard anecdotes of racist and degrading behaviour by teachers and principals. One teacher suggested to another that a young Black elementary student “will be a drug dealer just like his dad.” One principal told a student to stop hanging around with his “monkey friends,” referencing his Black peers.
* The n-word is tossed around like a ball – in the hearing of teachers – and even painted on a wall at a school. Not enough is done to stop it.
* Parents complain, feel unheard, and have no confidence in the Board’s ability to address their concerns and educate their children. Those who can, move their kids. Meanwhile, some staff dismiss them as whiners who are “unfairly slandering” the PDSB.
* There is “strenuous resistance, even at the trustee level, to anti-Black racism training” though it is obviously needed.
* School trustees are dysfunctional, constantly at each other’s throats, have little or no training, are clearly ill-equipped to provide oversight and are enmeshed in conflicting positions, such as pushing to get jobs and influence for favourites – nepotism gone wild. The reviewers state “grave concerns” about its ability to fulfill its legal obligations. Interactions with parents at public meetings are farcical.
* Senior staff seem paralyzed by the dysfunction – unable to make simple decisions, the reviewers found. The director of education does not have a steady hand on the ship. Senior staff have little grasp of their human rights responsibilities.
* PDSB hiring practices are compromised, promotions manipulated to the point of lost credibility. In fact, the board’s system, designed to achieve employment equity may, in fact, be screening out targeted staff."
179,fqmszjw,"&gt; but no one is thinking about it from the perspective of “black boys are just so responsible”.

No. No one is thinking from that perspective because the whole process happens *without thinking*. It happens with looking, seeing ""there's a kid that ought to know better"", and punishing them for their behavior, where a white kid of the same age in that same position is subconsciously seen as *younger*, gets a ""they don't know any better"" or ""they're too young to control themselves"", and gets a lighter punishment.

Adults subconsciously ascribing more agency/responsibility on black kids is not the only mechanism by which black kids get treated more poorly by adults than white kids, and maybe not even the primary mechanism, but it is *a* mechanism.

&gt;A similar thing actually happens to women and girls around sexual violence. They are attributed agency over the actions of of their rapist, having “tempted” or “seduced” their attacker through their clothes, flirting, drinking, something to that effect.

Yes, you're right, it does happen to women when we talk about sexual assault, and it is alarming and fucked up and shitty that it does. This is absolutely a context in which men tend to be ascribed less agency than appropriate, women tend to be ascribed more agency than appropriate, and it is shitty for women.

&gt;I wouldn’t call either of these experiences really “having too much agency” so much as I would call them “victim blaming” or “justifications for oppression” or something to that effect.

Yes, good, and it feels like you are putting phrases like ""having too much agency"" and ""seeking to abandon agency"" in my mouth, when in fact you are really the origin of that framing in this conversation.

I did not say that having more agency is bad, or that men should seek to abandon agency. The actual thing I was talking about is a lot closer to men ""being ascribed too much agency"" rather than men ""having too much agency"". Or at any rate, hopefully it makes sense to read what I wrote that way and reading it that way may give you a clearer picture of what I am trying to talk about."
180,flo972z,"Since when were white women the only ones to give false testimonies? Y’all being lying on the stand just like anyone else. 

And to perpetuate the idea that women should no longer believed for things like rape and sexual assault is disgusting. Especially considering how many of our young black girls are victims themselves with no one to believe them or fight for their justice. Honestly, choke."
181,fbl8cw4,"So as a personal journey I grew up religious and that is pick me ground zero.  They put a lot of responsibility on women to keep a man and respect male leadership, even to our detriment.

I was very unhappy all the time in those relationships so I searched for different answers.  

But even anti-Pickmeisha advice out there never quite put the whole picture together for me. I didn’t like Why Men Love Bitches or The Rules at first because I hated having to put on an “act” and all the subtly manipulative things you were expected to remember to do.  All this performative femininity for what? The pleasure of being some man’s live in maid, dick sucker and baby incubator? It seemed like we were expected to do a lot and get very little back. 

All the advice written by men just seemed like disingenuous pandering to women or overly abusive and blaming us for men’s behavior (Like the “Black Girls Are Easy Blog), and not really telling the truth about how men are. 

So sometimes you’d read scenarios in the book and they would never talk about the men who would just outright sexually assault you, lie and lovebomb, and all the outright abusive things that women know men are frequently capable, of that men seem to be oblivious to. The very subtle and less obvious manipulation that even “nice guys” are guilty of. 

I was just always depressed that I had to do so much to get men to even see me like a human being. I used to try and be the perfect Christian wifey type, the LibFem “everyone is equal type” and it both left me empty.

So many men are useless wastes of space who bleed you dry emotionally and leave your worse than when they found you. And when you date the wrong guys people were always quick to blame women for it for “choosing” wrong and “attracting” the wrong guys. But I’ve been in several tax brackets and I can tell you the men are shit at every level. 

I started to question, what is even the fucking point of dating men? Everyone always tells women to do so much but what are men responsible for? 

What clicked for me is I started looking at the data. I’m a blsck woman, and I basically looked at all the statistics for how poorly blsck men are doing in comparison to blsck women. There’s literally half as many black men with degrees than blsck women. And a large percentage of those who are educated prefer to date nonblack
Women. 

So statistically it would be literally impossible for the vast majority of upwardly mobile black women to marry a man on their level. Suddenly I realized, it’s not that me and all my girlfriends were choosing wrong, ITS LITERALLY ALMOST FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE BLACK MEN ARE FAILING TO KEEP UP.  

But the whole time, much of the blsck community was still blaming black women for “choosing wrong” and critiquing every single thing  about blsck women as an excuse to date nonblack women and blame us for why the blsck community was failing even though it was obvious we were doing everything we could to support clearly ungrateful men while outperforming them. 

Why am I supposed to submit and support a bunch of dummies who are nowhere near as smart or driven or hard working as me?

So I thought- What if that were true for everybody?  What if The vast majority of men of all races are just hot flaming garbage, and it’s not us? We aren’t all “picking wrong”  - there are mass cultural pressures out there designed to bully and distract us to ignore when **men are actually the problem and when they are the ones failing, not us.** 

We are literally FORCED to take on more responsibility for men’s behavior than we should from birth, and furthermore give men chances we shouldn’t. 

And suddenly I started to see it everywhere. All of the “conventional wisdom” that somehow always benefits men even when objectively its wrong:

* Ugly guys will treat you better - WRONG. 
* Dating older men is better bc they’re more mature - WRONG. 
* If you look a certain way or are truly a bad bitch men wont try to treat you bad -WRONG

I realized that women have been lied to all our lives and it’s culture wide and designed to push blame on us and bully us into fucking some of these incels and undesirables so they don’t go crazy.  

If you experience something bad at the hands of men they’re quick to scream “not all men!!”. Okay, no, not every single man, but what if it were actually most of them, and statistically you would meet more of the bad men than not? When does something cease to be a personal problem and become a pervasive cultural issue?

I guess you could call it like finally taking the redpill and seeing the reality of male bullshit, and how literally everything they say and do, no matter how seemingly benevolent or innocuous or unrelated on the surface is designed to make us easier to fuck. **All of it.**

The Pickmeisha In me died. I realized that they literally do not give a fuck about women and are so much more depraved in general than they want us to see."
182,f0jn0de,"This is such a good post. I'm gonna reply to a lot of it out of the sheer joy of having an interesting conversation moreso than the ""You are man, I am feminist answering man question"" format. Everything below represents my own experiences, observations and ideas - this isn't representative of feminism or anything else, and I would not be surprised if I get shit wrong. So please let me know if I do.

&gt; For example, when white men such as Brock Turner assault or just generally misbehave with women of any race, there is a much larger chance that they'll get away with it under the idea that ""Boys will be boys"" or ""He has a bright future."" Conversely, if a man of color were to do the same to white women, the ""boys will be boys"" card is much less likely to be played effectively to a white audience: black and brown men are seen as a ""threat"" to the purity of white women, and MoC will be expected to toe the line in a way that white men won't be. 

100%. There is no question that there's a double standard, and that double standard harms women and POC disproportionately. Socioeconomic class is also a very large part of this. No surprise then that women and POC tend to be underpaid compared to white men of otherwise comparable (or less) work / education / experience.

&gt; Many white men clearly display anxieties about men of color and white women, out of a sense that they should be the ones to control ""their own"" women and not MoC. 

*Yes*. This is one of the reasons I really get skeeved out by the white supremacist movement. Not only is, y'know, forced relocation and genocide bad (the children at the border is the clear and present issue at the moment), but that's just the START. The end game is to control white women and force them to make more white babies. Women can't be trusted to make choices about their bodies when they consistently make the wrong choice (by choosing to have sex with minorities, non-christians, and/or liberals). If we look at the weird venn overlaps of white supremacy, religion, and incels, the idea of women and sex with white women as earned rewards is a scary and pervasive concept that seems to be a foundational aspect of all three. In other words, this is all very much our collective fight.

&gt; White men will also come down hard on perceived sexism by men of color: many a conservative is happy to share thinkpieces on how Middle Eastern Muslims are essentially a barbaric race with unevolved views on women. Sexism is seen as bad when men of a particular race do it, which can seem contradictory to the idea that male privilege is kind of all-encompassing.

I distinctly remember after 9/11 hearing DJs on the radio grappling with what had happened. They turned the oppression of women in the Middle East forced to wear burqas into a punchline for how evolved and forward thinking Americans are because they love women in bikinis. I was a kid at the time, but that has stuck with me for this exact reason. The double standard was never so succinctly or blatant to me than in that moment. Suffice it to say, I turned off the radio.

&gt; Hell, even in contexts that don't have to do with the harassment of women, ""boys will be boys"" doesn't really apply to black boys who are thought to have a weapon, whereas roughhousing and a fascination with guns and violence are seen as acceptable for young white boys under the idea that, well, ""boys will be boys."" Black boys especially are seen as threatening from the outset and have to run the extra mile to prove that they aren't to white society at large.

There's very much this idea that none of us (outside of wealthy white men) are really *allowed* to exist in our world or our society except at their discretion. Like, we should all be grateful to be here because if they wanted us gone, we'd be gone. That's kind of the subtext of the narrative. So I think anyone who is subjugated is considered a potential threat, because at any moment they could ""wake up"" and be *really fucking pissed off*. That's why there's all this emphasis on control. Like, yeah, of course, black boys are dangerous. Black men are dangerous. Because if it were white men putting up with this shit, they'd be fucking furious, and they would *never* stop fighting until they got what they felt they are entitled to by birth. But don't you dare look angry, or seem upset about anything, much less talk about anything political or racial, because then you're just proving the stereotype. Again, you should just be grateful you're allowed to be here. 

&gt; I've heard of anecdotes in the Indian community in America where families will sweep the assault of their daughters by trusted family friends under the rug in order to ""make face"" and not rock the boat. Mona Eltahawy talks about how many Muslim men have shut down the conversation about the harassment of women in Muslim environments. And Hindu, Muslim, and Christian South Asian parents alike often instruct their daughters to dress a certain way (ex. not wearing shorts) so they don't attract ""the wrong kind of attention"" from men, rather than questioning the actions of said men. 

It sucks. I also think there's very much an element of ""it's our community, we will deal with it."" Which... I mean, I get it. I don't like it, but I get it. There's an extreme double standard around it, too, as you pointed out above, which makes it even harder to look at objectively and separate truly toxic behaviors from ones that have simply been demonized by society as inherently ""black/brown/barbaric"" traits. Expecting everyone to see it for what it is is asking a lot. It's asking everyone to be a cultural anthropologist, essentially, and those guys aren't really known for their objectivity, either. I don't have any answers here. Shit's just complicated and hard.

&gt; As an aside, I think this somehow also ties into how what MRAs see as ""female privilege"" really only applies to a certain subset of hyper-feminine white women. The speech by Sojourner Truth, Ain't I a Woman?, comes to mind in regards to that matter.

Kind of tangentially, feminism as a movement historically has done a terrible job of considering people of color, much less representing them. Full stop. I think a lot of mainstream media really seeks to divide and conquer white women and WoC in how ""feminist issues"" are portrayed. And there are plenty of feminist bigots out there, whether TERFs or run of the mill racists. Further, that underscores a lot of the problem we have when it comes to all of this, which is that white women may have to fight harder than white men to be heard, but they can still be heard. It's novel for a person of color to get a platform at all, and when they do, there are rules (implicit or explicit) about what they can say and the subjects that are taboo for them to speak about. That's white female privilege in a nutshell. A white woman has more freedom and access to speak truth to power. A black man or woman may be going hoarse for all the speaking they've done, but if no one can hear them, does it matter?"

184,ezrot06,"I dated a nice black girl in high school (I'm white). She was actually really cool. That shit would never work these days. In 5 minutes I'd be in jail for assault after the first 10 dudes told her she ""needs a black king"". Also modern black girls all seem like ratchet prostitutes who only want money. White girls do it too but seems like black girls are more open about it. ""Gernerous mans only"""
185,er8p960,"When I see guys on the sidewalk I look down at my phone, always keep my headphones in, or get on a phone call quick and watch shadows to make sure I’m not being followed. I’ve had grown men follow me in broad daylight going to and from school from the ages of 12-18 in both the suburbs and the city. And curse at me when I don’t stop to talk to them in their cars. And rub themselves on the metro. And try to give me rides from high school. I could go on but you get it, it’s a jungle out there. Homes being around wouldn’t make me feel any more comfortable. There was a case where a guy held a knife to a girl at her bus stop, and took her to his home a few blocks away to rape her for the day before letting her go. People being around doesn’t make me any more comfortable since at 16 nobody ever interceded to help, and that hasn’t changed as I’ve gotten older. I had two guys come up to me and rub my legs at a bar while my two male friends stood directly next to me. I excused myself and walked away, later both my friends suddenly were like “I didn’t like how those guys touched you I was gonna punch them” but both were dead silent as it occurred. 

Her background adds nuance, black girls are statistically more likely to be victims of sexual assault, second only to indigenous girls (because they’re highly visible poc, less likely to be believed when they’re assaulted, and less likely to report due to fears of police), so it is highly likely she has either been a victim in the past or was scared to be a victim in the future. It’s shitty but it happens really often to her demographic so fear makes sense.

! You sound like a nice person, so don’t take the sins of others on yourself. You know you mean no harm, just pass by and continue living. Don’t be worried about making people uncomfortable, in fact be hyper vigilant to intercede if you notice others making women uncomfortable (street harassment, inappropriate touching, etc.), most guys are more likely to stop if another man calls them out on it. Then you’re a good guy and a hero :)"

&gt;But black womens' backsides are so famous that in the 19th century some Frenchman even captured a black woman, Sarah Baartman, just to display her and her butt to curious Europeans as a sideshow attraction in France.
&gt;I'm just making a point that attraction to sexually attractive features does not = fetishization. 

I am *stupefied* by your comments. You need more Black friends. 

Sarah Baartman is the epitome of the downsides of fetishization and your white washing is microbial.  Fucking sideshow to curious Europeans sounds like a good thing to you?? She was treated like a total freak show. The antithesis of slight, feminine white beauty.  European ""curiosity"" was accompanied with the dehumanizing insulting industry of degrading this woman.

This story is a source of pain, not honor, to Black women. What next, minstrels were just cute, funny wholesome shows with lots of makeup?

And no, not ""just like"" not all whites have blonde hair blue eyes.  You're still white as a brunette and retain all the social benefits of your whiteness. Those social benefits are vast. A black woman being sexualized for her ass ceases to exist if she is flat. Sexualization is not the same benefit as white privilege. There's intense disrespect that comes with it. Little black girls are over sexualized far too early, can't dress like little white girls in normal shorts and tees cuz men. And black littie girls are FAR less protected.  Sexual assault and rape in and outside of families are too common in the black community 

Now girls are buying these asses to compete now bc of how black women are expected to have this figure. Other races have followed suit. Skinny black girls can all let u know what curveless life is like. If you cant even be sexually desirable AND you're black?  


You said a little while back that you understood minority friends more.  You do not. You sound more out of touch than the average white people I'm around and I'm surrounded by them"
187,eerm9ow,"I recently attended a talk by the BAME forum at my university  (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnics) who organized a discussion about black voices in the MeToo movement. I think there's no denying that the movement, which was created by a working black woman, has been highjacked by Hollywood liberalism. At the talk, they showed us some statistics which stated how young black girls are more likely to be victims of sexual assault, yet we hardly hear their voices in the MeToo movement. So I definitely agree with Zizek on the notion that MeToo is no longer what it was, and has become instead a middle-class movement which doesn't seek radical or real change.

&amp;#x200B;

On the point about presenting alternatives to men, I'm not sure. I see your point. It should be self-evident, but maybe Zizek is trying to point out that the New MeToo movement is only about ""hiding"" the problem. It's about men behaving properly rather than radically changing the relationship between genders."
188,efrl6vb,"&gt;	Then explain why 60% of black girls are assaulted/raped before age 18? 

You don’t know how to interpret statistics. Its a small subset of men who commit most of those crimes. Plenty of rapists have multiple victims. Its not a one to one ratio. The rate of rape would be way higher if that was the case. You’re using the same fallacies white supremacists use. Also I’m pretty sure it’s actually closer to [25%.](https://www.theroot.com/sexual-assault-awareness-month-why-we-must-focus-on-bl-1794400667) 

&gt;	Overall, statistically, Native Americans have the highest rate of sexual assault in the country with a probability that nearly 27 percent of Native woman will experience rape in their lifetimes. Black women follow that with a probability of 22 percent—or 3,186,000 being raped over the span of their lives. 

This isn’t unique to black community either. The problem isn’t that we’re all a bunch of rapists. It’s that the rapists are not held accountable. "

But it's [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackfellas/comments/ad7gk0/is_it_just_me_why_does_it_seem_like_the_metoo/) thinking and the comment by DrFattima that hurt black girls, women and little boys the most.

Black girls are always deemed ""fast"" and told we deserve it. There's little to no public outrage whenever we are victims of rape, sexual harassment/assault, or domestic violence. The ""what happens in this house stays in this house"" mentality doesn't help either. 

But the fact that someone thought it was ok to say ""16 y/o borderline think for themselves. It's on them tp want to have sex with grown men. Some places in the US allow 16+ to choose their sex partners."" is sickening and exactly why we're having this conversation decades after he raped and pissed on a child. "
190,eaivuva,"&gt; and do I really need to link the video of the woman who accused a 9 year old boy of sexual assault?

He says like racism isn't an issue completely separate from what is being talked about and there isn't research showing how we regularly assume black boys are older than they really are, an assumption we don't make for white boys. Also like thinking your ass was touched by a stranger (mistakenly, but still) isn't a scary and angering situation and is at all analogous to being angry that a man said ""hello"". 

You can come up with an exception for everything. You show me one video (presumably, I don't watch misogynist youtube) that indicates a woman felt harassed by a man saying hello, I show you the billions of times men say hello to women and don't experience backlash every single day. Then I show you the millions of times women are actually sexually harassed every day and you tell me which one of us is brainwashed into thinking a systemic problem exists when it doesn't.

191,ebx8g5p,"Not to toot my own horn, but I wrote [2 mega posts that document how boys(with a focus on black boys) are failing behind school in menslib 3 months ago](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/9dcbrm/lets_talk_about_boys_and_education/e5hb7so/). But I have to say, if youre interested in the discussion please read the whole thread. It had 150+ comments but its a wealth of good discussion and viewpoints. My post is nowhere near as good without all the discussion on the subject. 

That said when you look at the numbers, it becomes just very clear how much racism plays a big part in the gap. Black boys are much more likely to get suspended, drop of school, face corporal punishment(*beaten* at school), fail their classes, struggle from poor socioeconomic status, arrest in school properties and more. Keep in mind for punishments, its already been demonstrated that these effects are **disproportionate** for black boys. Meaning boy's behavior alone cannot explain the difference. Also, Teachers are much more likely to grade girls higher marks for the exact same work as boys, and if previous patterns bear any foreseable meaning, most likely they grade black students even worse. The education gap is even bigger in southern states, which adds to an all too familiar trend in the difference of treatment blacks and whites receive. Boys also face stereotype threat issues much like girls in math and sciences do, and when teachers fail to acccount for this and prime boys to do worse, they will. Unfortunately the discussion has been largely dominated by white men and women who fail to properly consider how much they've impacted black students, especially at the intersection of race and gender. Lord help them understand how much theyve fucked over black girls with the school to prison pipeline and how little they care about their sexual assault. Just know now its very easy to tell how white someone is if they blabber about how boys cant sit still and need to pull up their bootstraps. How about not being a racist sack of shit?

192,e43c1r4,"&gt;Mujey was initially labeled by police as a runaway — a classification that surprised and upset her family when they learned of it. Law enforcement agencies have been criticized in recent years for assuming missing black girls are runaways. . . . The department said there was “no indication of foul play” when Mujey was reported missing; investigators didn’t know she was involved in an ongoing sexual assault case until after her body was found.

Nice going, guys."
193,e43nl0q,"&gt;But there was also the incident in 2016, when James allegedly assaulted a 20-year-old woman by trying to strangle her, “in broad daylight, on public street in front of neighbors,” according to court papers. That year, the Kentwood Police Department and Kent County Sheriff's Department each filed a domestic assault report involving James, including one initiated by a 911 caller who said he saw James choking a woman in an apartment complex parking lot. In a report from 2015, he was accused of choking, threatening to kill, punching, and pinning a woman down with one of his knees in her groin. In 2011, he was accused of stalking a woman who’d turned down an intimate relationship with him, a report said. James denied these accusations, telling officers his own version of events. No charges were ever filed.

For fuck's sake, how many different police reports would it have taken before the police took this guy seriously? They had a witness in at least one of these cases, the 9/11 caller. 


&gt;Not long after Mujey’s killing, Kelly was questioned about his decision to grant a $100,000 bond to James. He told a reporter from Kalamazoo’s Newschannel 3 that he doesn’t have a crystal ball, and that James’ bond was appropriate “given the information I had at the time … Of course, in hindsight, I have more information.”

&gt;For example, Kelly said, he didn’t know James had been accused of rape before. A BuzzFeed News review of the pretrial risk assessment and bond recommendation forms presented to Kelly confirms B.T.’s rape report wasn’t mentioned. Neither were nearly all of James’ other brushes with the law beginning in the late ’80s — none of the strangulation or attempted sexual assault accusations that prosecutors would later highlight as evidence of dangerous, repetitive behavior.


This is just inexcusable. The *judge* setting bail in a rape case wasn't informed that three different women had reported to the police that James had assaulted or raped them? What fucking excuse was there for the police departments not to share that information? If they had, Mujey Dumbuya might still be alive. 

&gt;Mujey was initially labeled by police as a runaway — a classification that surprised and upset her family when they learned of it. Law enforcement agencies have been criticized in recent years for assuming missing black girls are runaways. The Grand Rapids Police Department said it usually classifies teens as runaways when there’s not “any indication of an abduction, assault, or endangerment.” The department said there was “no indication of foul play” when Mujey was reported missing; investigators didn’t know she was involved in an ongoing sexual assault case until after her body was found.


This is unbelievable as well. Absolutely unbelievable. The victim in a rape case where the suspect is out on bail and they treated her disappearance as non-suspicious. How the hell is information-sharing between police departments and police departments and the courts *this* bad?"

196,do8krbz,"I'm a Black woman and a survivor and I can definitely relate to the part about ""starting out consenting."" I felt like I was treated like that way when I reported my own assault. Even in the Black community, there's this thing about Black girls being ""fast-tailed"", basically this notion that Black girls are the ones that go around flirting and trying to have sex with grown men when it's really the other way around, but we get blamed for men preying on us instead."
197,djlcwpv,"None of these comments point out how creepy it is that little Black girls are assumed to know more about **sex** than little girls of other races. I assume it's adults they studied, so what makes an adult think a little black girl knows anything about sex? That's really scary because it adds to stereotypes of black female promiscuity while Black female victims of sex crimes are still seen as less innocent and in need of protection. There actually seems to be a belief that black women are so ""strong"" we can fight off men who try to assault us, although stats show we are more likely to be sexually assaulted so it's not true.

Because she's finally getting her recognition. Before Hidden Figures I couldn't name a single Black woman who ever worked at NASA. Now I know three. That's not a lot, but it's a good thing for me to remember the names of the shoulders of giants that we all stand on. White men have Einstein, Hawking, Hubble, Bohr, Newton, basically every famous astronomer and physicist in history. People need role models. Having role models is a good thing. This move gives people the chance to have role models that look like them. 

I remember what got me into astronomy at age 6. It was the utterly tragic Columbia disaster. My science teacher put up a little memorial to the people who died in the disaster. One of them was Kalpana Chawla. I had never ever seen a person who looked like me before, growing up in such a white area. As a little Indian girl, knowing that people like me could do great things convinced me I should do great things do. And I did. And I am. And I am grateful to Kalpana and to my teacher because I would not have done it without them."
199,evzzpcq,"First of all, most black girls are not known for ugly faces. There are plenty of Black girls and women who are regarded as attractive by their peers and society. Although, I am disappointed but unsurprised that this may be what you observe in your setting. Depending on the demographic of your area, the racism can be subtle and passive or aggressive and blatant.

Also please understand that when I say 'racism', I am talking about a system that essentially distorts our reality to associate Black with all things bad, and White as all things good. **Yeah, stop internalizing that shit.** Instead of asking ""Why are most black girls known for ugly faces?"" you need to be asking why blatant racism at your school is allowed if the boys there are blatantly making nasty statements about Black women's appearances. I am sure those statements wouldn't be taken lightly if a group of students were disparaging any other demographic. Pull some crocodile tears and quietly report the racist assholes to who ever is in charge and bring up your mental health (which it is obviously affecting) because in reality, that language shouldn't be tolerated. 

Your other option is to stop listening and paying attention to what teenage boys say. Most of them are immature and will say whatever will get them social acceptance and praise from their friends. If you were to listen to these same guys' views on gender, sexuality, current events, or any other topic you'd probably find that many of them have equally trash views on those subjects as well. 

 Your self esteem can't be influenced by what emotionally immature, racist teenage boys think. That's just setting yourself up for disaster. People can try to tell you what is and isn't beautiful but ultimately, you can choose your own standards for beauty. My preference in beauty leans more toward Afro-centric features and bone structures and most of the people around me are the same way. What matters most is what you like about yourself and what makes you feel beautiful. I really suggest focus on finding that. Play with your hair, makeup, style, and accessories until you feel confident and comfortable in what you're wearing.

Why are you awkward? Is it shyness or social anxiety? Try to figure it out and address it. In the meantime, you have to put yourself out there to improve your social skills. Regardless of your looks, they do matter in the real world and can take you very far in life in terms of establishing long lasting relationships and important connections. Is there an anime club at your school? Why not join it to meet other anime fans? If not, why not make one? This can apply to your other interests as well.

Lastly, I really want to reemphasize the importance of not internalizing racist bullshit. If these groups of people were so secure in themselves they wouldn't need a century long marketing campaign to prop their features above our own and feel the need to constantly talk shit about people they're so much better than. Surround yourself with beautiful and positive images of Black Women and get comfortable with yourself. You will be alright."
200,fwspqsr,"Ehhhh thats a fine line there.

""You're so pretty for a black girl"" and ""you're so well spoken for a black kid"" are also really racist things to say, but people (I've only had white people do this to me personally) say it. Its a compliment with a veiled insult that the person saying it often doesn't think about.

Why add on the ""for a black""? It implies that black girls are normally ugly or black kids usually don't speak English ""properly"" (mostly in reference to ebonics). 

There's no hatred, but the racism is still there."
201,frsvgkl,"Damn bruh I feel like I'm going through the same situation I've been dating a white girl for the past 2 years, but most of my gf in the past have been black I truly believe I should be with a black women and slyly think that I'm letting down my race I also live in London and seeing a black guy with a white women is very common.  But for me..  white girls we're never embarrassed to walk the street with me, it was more my paranoia I always thought people were staring...my girl is blonde and slim thick so she's gets a lot attention so I've had white guys in clubs say uncomfortable things to me and black women always seem to give unfortable stares. 
But mostly when I see a black guy with a white girl I also look at these guys in a certain way especially if she's not attractive, we already have the stereotype of dating fat white women. 
And also social media has made race relations worse for example these blog pages post a black man with a non black women and he gets labelled a coon, sellout, you hate yourself etc
 
also a lot of black guys have history of disrespecting black women in public platforms which I don't agree with, So me dating a white women would associate me with those type of guys ,
So all these things has made me worried about dating other races of women and it will be easier to deal with and maybe relate more with a bw.

Yeah sometimes I feel like I'm the only black male who thinks like this because most guys are happy to date white women and feel like they have a trophy. But in London and especially where I live most black guys I see with kids they mostly have mixed kids which is big problem maybe self-hatred. But I know I shouldn't think like that because I'm dating a white girl now, 

I have to admit I have high standards in women in general but when dating a black women I would rather her wear natural hair or if you going to wear weave not all the time so maybe I have higher standards for black women which is not fair .
Also when I'm out in clubs and approaching women surprisingly I have a higher chance of getting with a white women than black. I think that's due to black girls are used to getting hit on like that so she might make me work harder and white girls a little more open.

But at the end of the end of the day the way the world is going I think it's better to date inside your race."
202,ft11ug8,"Wow....This is the first post on Reddit I am  able to relate to so much.

Sorry you feel this way though"
203,fnkvpdc,"I don’t know how exactly to write this so I will just spit it out. 

One thing that is a nightmare is being Black and trying to get help from doctors who have no idea that African-Americans suffer from disorders. It took me FIVE doctors before someone took me seriously. I had to beg for treatment. I was told to my face that Black people don’t die from eating disorders by DOCTORS. I have been called a hypochondriac, as though I could possibly not realize that purging 10+ times a day was disordered. And my fifth doctor told me the reason why they never take us seriously is because there’s no race-specific education given and students just assume the majority of people who have EDs are non-Black. 

I was Bulimic for 10 years and kept trying to get help, and every time I was disregarded, it made it more difficult for me to keep going in. I never gave up because as Black women, we unfortunately have to advocate for ourselves way more than we would if we weren’t, and I was finally admitted at age 25. But I was more determined than most. 

I always think about how many other Black girls are turned away and not taken seriously, but who give up after the 1st or even 2nd rejection, especially because our bodies are the exact body types that have a hard time getting underweight. I never got below a 22BMI, even after months of keeping nothing down. 

Anecdotal evidence for eating disorders DOES count as real evidence, and there are a few obscure peer-reviewed journals you can find in educational libraries online for ED rates in Black people. But there’s just not enough being done to help us, and I hope my story will help you in your studies and future. 

Every time I try to tell my testimonial, I am disregarded or told I’m lying or that I must not have had a “real” disorder, and even though I’m opening myself up to the possibility of random commenters replying and calling me a hypochondriac again, I will post this in the hopes that I can help someone, somewhere.

For me, my ED was based in childhood trauma, my race, and growing up in a racist town. So when I went to treatment, they didn’t know how to help me. They were trained to look for commonalities, but they had no idea how to help me be comfortable in my body AND my ethnicity, and so my recovery was stunted. With my ED, it’s like you’re fighting against not only societal beauty ideals, but also hundreds of years of racism and hatred for the way we look. There’s no way they’re gonna dedicate entire courses in medical school to that, I think, so the only way I feel medical professionals can learn about how to help Black women with their disorders is for them to do a lot of research when they encounter African-American women who are trying to get help. 

I would say, my top 3 tips pertaining to what I wish happened for me would be this: 

1. Disregard weight. My natural weight is 170-180. If a Black woman comes to you and says she is purging or restricting, believe her regardless of weight.

2. Don’t fall into stereotypes. The stereotype that Black people don’t suffer from restrictive disorders is painfully untrue. The stereotype that most of us have BED is untrue as well.

3. We are /not/ hypochondriacs. 

I hope that helps!"
204,fko2gj1,"There are a couple things that anger me to no end and this is one of them. The fact that, as a community we feel the need to police people on arbitrary shit like *another* man’s masculinity or lack thereof. You can also group that with the extreme hatred for gay black men, and how they’re somehow destroying the community. Not the degenerates, the gay men...simply for being gay. I don’t like to compare struggles because there is no way to do so but the point is these people have it hard and to see them rejected is disheartening. As people who understand what it’s to be treated someway because of something out of your control, I wish, at the very least, that we would just let these people be. You don’t even have to be an ally, just leave them be. 

Another thing is the famous black pedophiles who are often...I don’t know...defended? It’s disgusting and it really goes to show you how worthless black girls are even amongst our own community."
205,fhmmckn,"**Bigoted** *adjective*  
big·​ot·​ed | \ ˈbi-gə-təd  \  

**Definition of *bigoted*:**  
blindly devoted to some creed, opinion, or practice

*especially:* having or showing an attitude of hatred or intolerance toward the members of a particular group.

**Examples of *bigoted* in a Sentence:**

// The opinion that OP's gender was the only reason she got a date was bigoted.

// It's not wrong to notice women get more attention on Tinder, but it sounds pretty bigoted when put like that.

It's not hard to see how the comment itself is bigoted, even if you have trouble noticing sexism. Try swapping the context to something else, like racism:

206,fjcre0p,"Men who are in relationships and/or otherwise engaged. Admittedly, there was a time a couple of years ago where I was knowingly ""the other woman"" to someone for a couple of months, but since I pulled myself out of that mental space I vowed never to do that again. However, for some reason, I remain a burning flame for the unfaithful mothmen. I've come to think that I must seem in some way ""spicy"" or ""exciting"", which leads to the next category..

BORING MEN. I don't necessarily mean in the conventional sense, either - they are, on the surface, relatively interesting people in different ways (varied jobs, different backgrounds, etc). But I think I am giving off (or they're imposing onto me) some sort of Manic Pixie Dream Girl vibe and they are usually in a rut of some kind and they think I'm the enigmatic, quirky solution to their problems. This is usually accompanied by a lot of the ""you're not like other girls"" nonsense - when, in fact, yes I really am because women are shockingly all multifaceted individuals and can be into hair and makeup AND Mesopotamian history AND economics AND sexual psychology AND gaming, all at the same time?? Revolutionary.

Fetishizers also love me. I've got a Kardashian-esque look - not really, but kind of - think the shitty, kind of chunky bootleg version. Essentially I've got a big bum and dark hair. If I had a pound for every man that's approached me with an ""you're so exotic"" flex, I'd be a rich woman. I've had men straight up tell me that they're into me because they like PAWG (Phat Ass White Girl, for those not in the know - although this is Reddit so I imagine people are savvy) porn or because ""black girls are ugly but you've got a black girl's body - best of both worlds!"". Many black men carrying around internalised racism and self-hatred, essentially. It is as sad as it is annoying and disgusting."
207,fjpqrrc,"This is why representation matters. I don’t think people realize that for dark skin black girls, when they do see pretty black women in the media, they are typically mixed raced or light skinned. If the woman is a DSBW in the media, she is typically the sidekick, the butt of the joke, has very short hair, very overweight, and/or loud/angry. Very negative qualities sometimes. They internalize it and begin to think: if I was lighter or mixed race, I will be perceived as beautiful and given more positive qualities. It also doesn’t help that black male celebrities, particularly rappers, seem to like to get on their soapbox a lot and tell people, unprovoked, how ugly DSBW are. 

It really and truly does start this young. I remember as a kid I would pray to God that if he couldn’t make white, then could he please just make me light skinned. I saw how my lighter skinned female peers were treated growing up and I noticed that they were treated as more feminine, more docile, more desirable. A particular look for black women in my community was obviously more coveted. 

What is unfortunate is that black girls are born into the stereotypes of loud, combative, overweight, and hypersexualized. So combine all that and thinking that you’re ugly for just being black and you have one nice helping dose of self-hatred. 

Some people like to say that representation doesn’t matter and that a person’s race shouldn’t/doesn’t matter. But when you have such negative stereotypes and the media’s opinion on how a BW should look, you begin to desperately want to see someone who looks like you doing something positive. Or smart. Or being desired/beautiful. Or having hobbies outside of “stereotypical black women things”. Or just normal."

Racism requires prejudice plus power.

Racism involves one group having the power to carry out systematic discrimination through the institutional policies and practices of the society and by shaping the cultural beliefs and values that support those racist policies and practices.

214,eij5sq0,"&gt;I don’t see black women talking about black problems on social media either

This post honestly makes me sad because it shows that you know nothing about Black women. Yes, we do talk about Black issues YOU just don't see it. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Do you even go on
 r/blackladies or r/blackfellas, because we talk about it plenty. There are many black YouTubers that talk about black problems, there are a bunch of black women who talk about black women problems on Twitter. It's just not ALL we talk about. 

The reason why some of us are mad, is because we are still Discriminated against for our looks or thought of as ugly sometimes. Look up on YouTube, black girls are still sometimes getting in trouble in school for wearing either a) braids or b) their natural hair. They're told their hair is ""too distracting"". But it's sooo trendy when white celebrities do the same styles (Kardashians, other white or white passing women). Our natural looks are trashed on not even by just white people, black men do it the most! I have never seen a race of men bash their own women. So features and fashion that mostly we have (other races have them too but are most associated with us) are popular on others, not on us. 

Honestly, I'm just hurt an offended that you don't even do proper research and then act like we're being fucking babies who whine about unimportant things (again TO YOU) 

And by the way, for white people saying black women who bleach their skin are the same as these white girls? Do you even know why some black women do it? It's to look more conventionally attractive, to looks lighter, or to look like a mixed black person. In some countries like Jamaica they get more opportunities. Because they think black is ugly. They don't do it for fun like these women, they will do it even if they know it will fuck up their skin! That's how bad some of their self hatred is. "
215,edcc88j,"Just stop. Racism isn’t Leah’s about hatred, but there is an obvious reason why this question is continually asked and why Black girls are always talked about like we are ugly. I grew up in a White neighborhood and the amount of White people who had negative ideas of Black people and Black peoples features was **insane** considering there were like 2 black families in the entire city. I don’t buy it. There are many different types of Black women and I’m at a point where this is racism and I don’t care what anybody says about “preferences” because I grew up around this “I don’t hate blacks, I just think they’re *too different*” type of racism. It’s still racism. Black girls are FEMALE, stop separating us so drastically from other races of women and acting like we are anything like trans women or as biologically unattractive as overweight people.

They are called

""negrito Sandia"" ( blackie watermelon)
""Negrita cucurumbe"" (black girl cucurumbe)

I say incocently because neither of these songs intend any hatred towards people of that color, the watermelon one is about how someone who curses a lot is gonna get spanked, and the cucurumbe one is about how beautiful black girls are (a black girl goes to the ocean to make herself white, a fish with a bowler hat approaches and tells her how gorgeous she is with her black skin. The fish goes so far as to questioning why she ever wanted to be white)

Maybe it was just me, but I never encountered much racism towards people of any color in Mexico.

What when did I say this. I said the supremacy clause makes it so if you're not a supremacist for your group then you can't be racist. I found this to be a poor definition and most people agree with me so they throw out the supremacy clause. 


&gt;There's nothing wrong with saying ""I prefer staying with black/white/Asian people"" but there is something wrong with saying ""I don't want to be around any blacks/whites/Asians because I prefer black/white/Asian people""

Saying I prefer being around whites is the same as saying I don't want to be around blacks or other races. All you've done in the second scenario is single out a particular race you dislike for some reason.

Still preferences, it's just difficult to tell because it's put in such a rude way. "

I think a lot of rap and hip hop has views that go against what we believe in. We talk about it instead of outright banning it though. My 11 year old heard some of NWA while on a travel bus for his baseball team. They are popular again with the younger crowd thanks to the movie. My husband had a talk with him about why they made the kind of music they did and what it meant at the time. They have listened to more together since then. 

The n-word is completely banned in our house. 

Edit: For those unaware because it has been swept under the rug (I wonder why...)

It’s not out there, but I guess “put together” is something I’ve heard. I often get compared to black female celebrities who I know I DO not look like at all. I was having this conversation with this guy, who didn’t say t but had this stereotype that black girls are good singers. I happen to be an Alright singer but I don’t perform. He kept wanting me to sing and some of his guy friends were like “whooo go Ashanti Beyoncé.!” They kept trying to play music they thought I would like very hip hop sort of Toni Braxton and Destiny’s child. And I was like “ok look I cant sing, and I don’t sing” they were like whattt?? Of course you can, look at you! .... most of them were  northern european and probably didn’t grown up knowing a lot of black people, besides MTV music videos. So they essentially had stereotypes me as a performer. Even when I told them point blank they were still in denial. 


Another time I was standing with a group of friends in a store. Dressed in normal clothing. A woman rushes up to me sort of impatiently interrupting and asking if they have any more sizes of a top. I’ve had something similar happen so I knew she had assumed that I worked at the store. Even though I was talking to my friends and shopping together. 

I went to a boarding school and some people would arrive with chauffeurs and taxi drivers. People would constantly assume my dad was a driver. It was a black Range Rover, and Of course I’m black too. 

Classic example. One of my sisters has really Asian feature. Slanted eyes very fair skin. She looks like she’s half black and half Chinese/Japanese/Korean. Just naturally most of her friends ended up being also partly Chinese. At high school there was a group of them, 7 in total. All apart from my sister had Asian mothers, some Filipina, Malaysian, Korean and Chinese. She always recounts that they often complained that people would assume their mother was their nanny. Even if it was in the context of a family holiday travelling in the airport with a traditional mother father and three children group. And even when they look half Asian. Nothing wrong with being a nanny, but it is ultimately offensive that s woman could be with her children and someone subconsciously thinks no you can’t be anything but the help in this equation. 

My final example is a huge problem for black girls. Guys in clubs will sometimes come up and touch your hair. Or get hollered “Hot chocolate”, or “Naomi Campbell” or again any famous black woman they can think of. Of course none of these are derogatory terms. But it’s unsettling not flattering. I don’t know if you’ve ever heard the song “don’t touch my hair” by solange. It’s one of those things that some people will brush aside but it’s incredibly painful after a while. It’s something non black people hsve probably never actually thought about. I will be with friends in a group of 6 or seven and someone will come straight for my hair. It’s guys more than girls, and the girls tend to ask more often than the guys. But most of the time they don’t ask at all. One night my hair was touched 9 times and only 2 of those times the person asked before. I know it’s not out of hatred. Often they’ll say something like your hair is beautiful, but I don’t see how reaching out to a strangers hair is ok. Sometimes it makes my skin crawl and it’s very frustrating. I don’t see guys do that to anyone but black girls. I never see guys do it to white girls. If they did they would probably be trying to annoy them. 

Or it could even be the classic “do youuuu speak English??” Not that Ive experienced that but just another example of how something can be racist but not hateful but ultimately offensive"

You got foolish pride, you got tooth decay
But tooth decay is another problem
So let's take this old foolish pride and solve it
Now, when I talk about foolish pride
I mean blacks &amp; whites taking different sides
When blacks and whites take different sides
Unity never happens, and we will subside
We will subside and hatred will release
And everything will just crush that peace
Well, when we crush that peace, we start hatin' each other
But remember, you are my brother, and you are my sister
Just like I'm a mister
I seen a black girlfriend and I kissed her
I kissed her; I placed it on her cheek
And she didn't come back til next week
Now it was next week and she was back again
Wanting to kiss a white kid
So she was my girlfriend, we started going out
But that's okay because we were Black and white
Blacks and whites they sometimes mix
But Black girls only want your money cause they're dumb chicks
So I'ma say like this
Don't date a Black girl, take it as a diss
If you want, but if you don't
I'ma tell you like this, I surely won't
Never date a Black girl because Blacks only want your money
And that shit ain't funny

Then you try to grab my spinach
Because its green and that's cash
So get outta here, 'cause I don't need your ass

Black girls and white girls just don't mix
Because Black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
White girls are good; I like white girls
I like white girls all over the world
White girls are fine and they blow my mind
And that's why I'm here now telling you this rhyme
'Cause Black girls, I really don't like
We don't mix, it's like riding a bike
When you're peddling hard, uphill both ways
You know it's kinda hard and that's why I say to you
I'm giving you a little advice
Don't date a Black girl, if you do it once you won't do it twice
You won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
And that ain't funny
So I'ma say look honey
I thought I said that before
But like I said again you're nothing but a big whore
So when mike catch on the bass line
That's okay 'cause we will not just waste time
I'll get straight to the point
Black girls are bitches, that's why I'ma tell ya you better pull up your britches
'Cause all that cash is making your ass drag
From the boyfriend ya ganked and that's pretty bad
I mean that's pretty sad when ya dating a Black guy
And then you turn around and fuck another big, Black guy
Now that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking
But that's okay because you need a goddamn spanking

222,e1t7d14,"&gt;doing something that fits your narrative,

Maybe if youd stop fitting the cliches to a tee youd stop evoking them.

&gt;I am an attractive mixed woman. In high school I was told “black girls are ugly or mediocre compared to white women at best” by black teen boys. Black football playing (unattractive) meatheads took the blondest white girls they could to all the dances, not a black girl was ever asked. I could go on and on with examples like this. No one said the word “roastie” exactly, but extremely cruel things have been said personally to me and to countless other black women I know. 

As I said, because high school chads were mean that means you've **only** ever dated white guys. All types of white guys but never an ethnic.

&gt;White girls of course moved on to white guys, and SO DID I

Because your still a childish selfhating girl trapped in highschool

&gt;I am interested in neither and so I will continue living and LOVING my life dating the guys I want while guys like you snicker and make up stories about how they must be mediocre or how I must hate myself.

Those boys were/are self hating just like you are. It's a shame you had to be told those insults, I'm sorry,  but you obviously internalized them into self hatred instead of moving on and above. I was bullied by the black girls back in school and the awkward white girls were the only ones to ever not be repulsed by me, but I didn't turn that into white worshiping self hatred, because I'm not weak.

 If you've apparently dated every kind of white guy who was "" from guys with a receding hairline to guys who are massively overweight to guys 15 years older"" yet not a single black/ethnic it's very clear you're with them because they are white and you're white worshiping/self hating. This isn't Fox News, no one's gonna believe all the successful black guys are rappers and sports stars lmfao. The teen chad highschool basketball players rejected you, they turned into 20 something chad basketball players with he same selfhatred but youve turned a blind eye to all the black men not only in highschool but through your life currently that aren't/weren't chads. 

The only truth here is that there is some severe self hatred on your part. I'm genuinely sorry for that and I hope one day you stop trying to live whiteness vicariously through the guys you date but live proudly yourself, and give people a chance irrelevant  of how some high-school kids treated you. Best of luck."

224,dy1ektt,"Racism in the U.S. has all sorts of foundations, none of them originally stemming from planted beliefs and a lack of familiarity with other races. White colonists didn't see Africans or Native Americans on the T.V. or in newspapers; they seeked out those different from them to enslave or overpower, and they had plenty of interactions, decade after decade.

I'll admit I live in a diverse state so I'm not entirely sure how often most Americans encounter people of different races but I think we can probably trust that many racists have encountered minorities in their lives, yet hold their beliefs steadfast. They saw firsthand the poise and respectability of Obama but that didn't convince them to stop calling him a thug, a monkey, or a terrorist.

I live in the D.C. area, and I went to the inauguration--you know how many rich white boys I saw there, clearly natives? You can't live in D.C. without encountering hundreds of black people a day. Yet they support Trump anyway, despite his racist beliefs.

Racism nowadays may be culturally founded, but the bias in practice is not culturally focused. The attacks on Sikhs, Indians, anyone brown after 9/11 prove that.

I also don't think the KKK-esque beliefs, such as comparisons of black people to gorillas, are culturally founded. Those are fueled by pure hatred of anyone who isn't white.

&amp; I don't see how any adult with a functioning mind and conscience can grow up to 20, 30, 40 yet still believe that an entire group of people is inferior for the color of their skin simply because their mother told them so decades ago. If your mother tells you the tooth fairy is real as a kid, do you believe her until you die? My mother told me at 11 that black girls are snobby, so don't make friends with them. Sure, I had black friends and classmates at the time but I wasn't thinking of them when I told her she was wrong...I was just thinking that you can't realistically stereotype a group of people like that. I was thinking, that's so many people, it's not fair to call them all something that many of them are not. That's the issue: if you lived in the 1850s, the 1950s, would you blindly believe black people were lesser because society tells you so? I can confidently say I wouldn't, and I believe that anyone who can't needs to work on their empathy and critical thinking skills. I'm not the smartest person in the world, often not even the room, but I understand that each and every individual has humanity, and that irrelevant factors are irrelevant.

Anyway, my point was that we don't need to childproof the vocabulary to convince adults to acknowledge social inequality."

226,enuv4vh,"0/10, clearly bait of sorts, but I'll bite.

🤔 if these were actual facts, I would have some sort of respect for you, but they aren't, so I don't. This is pretty appalling to read tbh.

&gt;White girls are classy Black girls are not classy

Environment has a solid influence on behavior, however you're saying because a girl is white she has class, as opposed to a black girl? How ridiculous, you must have a white mother. 👀

&gt;White girls are civil Black girls get into a fight over literally anything so not civil

This actually fits right into my above response, as if white girls don't do what all other groups of girls do, like pointlessly have fights in the bathroom 🤔

&gt;White girls are way less dramatic when with men. Black girls manage to start drama over literally anything

You being a brown man, should know that they'll lock you up really fast, over what a white girl said you did vs what you actually did. Let's be real, dramatic is dramatic, all women, and men do it.

&gt;White girls are pretty Black girls not so much

I can leave you to this one, I call it being absolutely subjective, it's more like you hate black girls, more than anything.

&gt;White girls are far less likely to divorce Black girls are 66% more likely to divorce than white girls

Total bs, that doesn't even make sense. 

&gt;I can understand everything white girls say I can barely understand half of what black girls say

It must be a lack of understanding AAVE. Must be your lack of proper communication skills.

&gt;White girls are cute voices Black girls do not have cute voices

I'm sorry, but white women are more likely to possess an annoying high pitched voice, while that is not the case for black women. 

&gt;I must say this is not about any other type other than fully African american with ancestors in america for centuries with very small exceptions, because their are acceptations.

This is tragic, because overall this applies to all american born women, who are deeply in tune with american culture. I'm just confused on what black women, and white women you've been around to even get to this point."
227,egjzvzk,"lol cause Hispanic girls are stereotyped to be so ""crazy n feisty mami 🔥🔥 💯😍😍"" but black girls are loud and rude even the behaviour is the same. also black men and white women have the highest divorce rate amongst all races"
228,ecumwkk,"nah.  i'm black/latino, and i almost exclusively date latino girls.  black girls are not as attractive, and white girls are crazy (there's a reason why the divorce rate for white woman + black male is near 100%).  i'm over 6ft tall, have that midtone light brown skin everyone loves, spend a lot of time in the gym, and i'm successful, so when i turn a girl away, they get salty."
229,dxzkc0g,I can go fuck a black lady. Offered sex by one before but I’m not into all the testosterone. Black girls are the easiest anyway not much of a challenge. No wonder white men- black women have lower divorce rates than black-black. (Look it up) We know how to satisfy them better.
230,dt04r6c,"A couple of points:

Different people are different, but...

Dating is really an American thing. In Australia, relations are much more informal. Meeting at the pub for a couple of drinks, meeting with friends for a movie, going for a swim, etc. If you sit at home waiting for a date, you are going to be disappointed.

And the whole marriage thing is fading fast. Lots more men today are actively avoiding marriage and are committed to staying single. Rabid Feminism has pretty much killed off romance, and has actually made it dangerous to get involved. Most marriages end in divorce with the guy loosing everything. At least that is the perception.

BTW, expecting your male to treat you as a special queen will ring alarm bells. Most people (Male or Female) have an extended circle of friends who they care about. To many males, a self-centred ""entitled"" female is  a sign of trouble. 

It might just be me, but black people are very welcome. Have only met a few American/blacks, but all have been delightful people. And black girls are so sexy.

Of course others here are going to declare me completely mad..."

[The Essence of Innocence: Consequences of Dehumanizing Black Children](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-a0035663.pdf)  
""We find converging evidence that Black boys are seen as older and less innocent and that they prompt a less essential conception of childhood than do their White same-age peers. Further, our findings demonstrate that the Black/ape association predicted actual racial disparities in police violence toward children.""

[Teachers More Likely to Label Black Students as Troublemakers](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/teachers-more-likely-to-label-black-students-as-troublemakers.html)  
""Across both studies, the researchers found that racial stereotypes shaped teachers’ responses not after the first infraction but rather after the second. Teachers felt more troubled by a second infraction they believed was committed by a black student rather than by a white student.  
In fact, the stereotype of black students as “troublemakers” led teachers to want to discipline black students more harshly than white students after two infractions, Eberhardt and Okonofua said. They were more likely to see the misbehavior as part of a pattern, and to imagine themselves suspending that student in the future.""

[Stereotyping across intersections of race and age: Racial stereotyping among White adults working with children](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201696)  
“Participants were 1022 White adults who volunteer and/or work with children in the United States who completed a cross-sectional, online survey. Results indicate high proportions of adults who work or volunteer with children endorsed negative stereotypes towards Blacks and other ethnic minorities. Respondents were most likely to endorse negative stereotypes towards Blacks, and least likely towards Asians (relative to Whites). Moreover, endorsement of negative stereotypes by race was moderated by target age. Stereotypes were often lower towards young children but higher towards teens.”

[Examining racial/ethnic disparities in school discipline in the context of student-reported behavior infractions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740918311095)  
“Engagement in particular behaviors had differential impact for African American vs. White students on the odds of receiving behavioral warnings, with African American students being less likely to be warned than their White peers. The current study demonstrates both the presence of disproportionality in non-exclusionary discipline as well as evidence that African American students experience escalated consequences (e.g., lower likelihood of receiving a warning) for infractions when they also engage in certain behaviors, even if those behaviors are not the direct cause for discipline.”

[Black Students Face More Discipline, Data Suggests](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/education/black-students-face-more-harsh-discipline-data-shows.html)  
""Although black students made up only 18 percent of those enrolled in the schools sampled, they accounted for 35 percent of those suspended once, 46 percent of those suspended more than once and 39 percent of all expulsions, according to the Civil Rights Data Collection’s 2009-10 statistics from 72,000 schools in 7,000 districts, serving about 85 percent of the nation’s students. The data covered students from kindergarten age through high school.""  
""Black and Hispanic students — particularly those with disabilities — are also disproportionately subject to seclusion or restraints. .... Black students with disabilities constituted 21 percent of the total, but 44 percent of those with disabilities subject to mechanical restraints, like being strapped down. And while Hispanics made up 21 percent of the students without disabilities, they accounted for 42 percent of those without disabilities who were placed in seclusion.""

""Black students accounted for 15 percent of the student body in the 2015-2016 school year but 31 percent of arrests. Two years earlier, black students accounted for 16 percent of the student body and 27 percent of arrests. The data also show students with disabilities are far more likely to face suspension or arrests at school. They accounted for 12 percent of enrollment but 28 percent of all arrests and referrals to law enforcement.  
A report from the Government Accountability Office released this month had similar findings, concluding that black students, boys and students with disabilities were overrepresented in disciplinary action: “These disparities were widespread and persisted regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school attended,” the GAO report said.""

“Black employment in the testing sector is suppressed in the absence of testing, a finding which is consistent with ex ante discrimination on the basis of drug use perceptions. Adoption of pro-testing legislation increases black employment in the testing sector by 7-30% and relative wages by 1.4-13.0%, with the largest shifts among low skilled black men.

Black (American) culture is derailed at its very core and we don’t have any solidarity or a common goal when it comes to “furthering or growing” the race. We just don’t. Jail, drugs, rap, trapping, low marriage rates, high infant mortality and out of wedlock births, gang violence, the stereotypes that do exist are contributing factors. NOW. Does that mean they apply to all people? No. 

But ask an OLD person in Asia. Italy. Norway. Columbia. What they think about black people. It’s going to be a culmination of the stereotypes I mentioned because that’s genuinely all they get exposure to via tv and media. For the most part. Not everyone from that camp is racist of course. 

On the colorist end I have seen dark skinned black woman be encouraged by her own family to procreate with a white or non black person so their kids don’t have “as black” features.

Stereotyping across intersections of race and age: Racial stereotyping among White adults working with children
“Participants were 1022 White adults who volunteer and/or work with children in the United States who completed a cross-sectional, online survey. Results indicate high proportions of adults who work or volunteer with children endorsed negative stereotypes towards Blacks and other ethnic minorities. Respondents were most likely to endorse negative stereotypes towards Blacks, and least likely towards Asians (relative to Whites). Moreover, endorsement of negative stereotypes by race was moderated by target age. Stereotypes were often lower towards young children but higher towards teens.”

Examining racial/ethnic disparities in school discipline in the context of student-reported behavior infractions
“Engagement in particular behaviors had differential impact for African American vs. White students on the odds of receiving behavioral warnings, with African American students being less likely to be warned than their White peers. The current study demonstrates both the presence of disproportionality in non-exclusionary discipline as well as evidence that African American students experience escalated consequences (e.g., lower likelihood of receiving a warning) for infractions when they also engage in certain behaviors, even if those behaviors are not the direct cause for discipline.”

“For poor children, the pattern is reversed. Most poor black boys  will remain poor as adults. White boys  raised in poor families fare far better.”

Discrimination and the Effects of Drug Testing on Black Employment
“Black employment in the testing sector is suppressed in the absence of testing, a finding which is consistent with ex ante discrimination on the basis of drug use perceptions. Adoption of pro-testing legislation increases black employment in the testing sector by 7-30% and relative wages by 1.4-13.0%, with the largest shifts among low skilled black men.

236,fzdhy60,"ever heard of casual racism? casual discrimination? that’s apart of systemic discrimination. have you had a day where it was bad because your friends made fun of you but you couldnt do anything, and it all adds up? casual discrimination can happen like that. it all adds up to a point where it feels like the world can be against you when it’s not actually, or at least completely. and im *just* talking about casual discrimination. not hate crimes, not racist shit, not racially profiling

systemic racism basically points out the cracks in the system as a whole. in a study it was said that stop and frisk was profitable because it was easy to stop minorities in America and search their cars and somehow finding a bag of weed and coke when stop and frisk was used. systemic racism is basically the “system” is still being subtlety racist. it doesn’t have to be a whole thing being racist to totally say it doesnt exist.

im also going to point out BS on your claim that buying a house and getting 30% off for being a minority lmao.

Black teens who commit a few crimes go to jail as often as white teens who commit dozens
""Although there were negligible differences among the racial groups in how frequently boys committed crimes, white boys were less likely to spend time in a facility than black and Hispanic boys who said they'd committed crimes just as frequently, as shown in the chart above. A black boy who told pollsters he had committed just five crimes in the past year was as likely to have been placed in a facility as a white boy who said he'd committed 40.""

Money, Employment and Housing

Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys
""Black boys raised in America, even in the wealthiest families and living in some of the most well-to-do neighborhoods, still earn less in adulthood than white boys with similar backgrounds, according to a sweeping new study that traced the lives of millions of children.
White boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way. Black boys raised at the top, however, are more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households.""
“For poor children, the pattern is reversed. Most poor black boys  will remain poor as adults. White boys  raised in poor families fare far better.”

Discrimination and the Effects of Drug Testing on Black Employment
“Black employment in the testing sector is suppressed in the absence of testing, a finding which is consistent with ex ante discrimination on the basis of drug use perceptions. Adoption of pro-testing legislation increases black employment in the testing sector by 7-30% and relative wages by 1.4-13.0%, with the largest shifts among low skilled black men. Results further suggest that employers substitute white women for blacks in the absence of testing.”

Minorities Who 'Whiten' Resumes Get More Job Interviews
""Employer callbacks for resumes that were whitened fared much better in the application pile than those that included ethnic information, even though the qualifications listed were identical. Twenty-five percent of black candidates received callbacks from their whitened resumes, while only 10% got calls when they left ethnic details intact.""
""Employers claiming to be pro-diversity discriminated against resumes with racial references just as much as employers who didn’t mention diversity at all in their job ads.""

Race at Work: Realities of Race and Criminal Record in the NYC Job Market
""As we can see in Figure 1, the proportion of positive responses depends strongly on the race of the job applicant. This comparison demonstrates a strong racial hierarchy, with whites in the lead, followed by Latinos, with blacks trailing far behind. These outcomes suggest that blacks are only slightly more than half as likely to receive consideration by employers relative to equally qualified white applicants. Latinos also pay a penalty for minority status, but they are clearly preferred relative to their black counterparts.""
""[T]his white applicant with a felony conviction appears to do just as well, if not better, than his black counterpart with no criminal background. These results suggest that employers view minority job applicants as essentially equivalent to whites just out of prison.""

[The Essence of Innocence: Consequences of Dehumanizing Black Children](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-a0035663.pdf)  
""We find converging evidence that Black boys are seen as older and less innocent and that they prompt a less essential conception of childhood than do their White same-age peers. Further, our findings demonstrate that the Black/ape association predicted actual racial disparities in police violence toward children.""

[Teachers More Likely to Label Black Students as Troublemakers](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/teachers-more-likely-to-label-black-students-as-troublemakers.html)  
""Across both studies, the researchers found that racial stereotypes shaped teachers’ responses not after the first infraction but rather after the second. Teachers felt more troubled by a second infraction they believed was committed by a black student rather than by a white student.  
In fact, the stereotype of black students as “troublemakers” led teachers to want to discipline black students more harshly than white students after two infractions, Eberhardt and Okonofua said. They were more likely to see the misbehavior as part of a pattern, and to imagine themselves suspending that student in the future.""

[Stereotyping across intersections of race and age: Racial stereotyping among White adults working with children](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201696)  
“Participants were 1022 White adults who volunteer and/or work with children in the United States who completed a cross-sectional, online survey. Results indicate high proportions of adults who work or volunteer with children endorsed negative stereotypes towards Blacks and other ethnic minorities. Respondents were most likely to endorse negative stereotypes towards Blacks, and least likely towards Asians (relative to Whites). Moreover, endorsement of negative stereotypes by race was moderated by target age. Stereotypes were often lower towards young children but higher towards teens.”

[Examining racial/ethnic disparities in school discipline in the context of student-reported behavior infractions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740918311095)  
“Engagement in particular behaviors had differential impact for African American vs. White students on the odds of receiving behavioral warnings, with African American students being less likely to be warned than their White peers. The current study demonstrates both the presence of disproportionality in non-exclusionary discipline as well as evidence that African American students experience escalated consequences (e.g., lower likelihood of receiving a warning) for infractions when they also engage in certain behaviors, even if those behaviors are not the direct cause for discipline.”

The data covered students from kindergarten age through high school.""  
""Black and Hispanic students — particularly those with disabilities — are also disproportionately subject to seclusion or restraints. .... Black students with disabilities constituted 21 percent of the total, but 44 percent of those with disabilities subject to mechanical restraints, like being strapped down.

[The Essence of Innocence: Consequences of Dehumanizing Black Children](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-a0035663.pdf)  
""We find converging evidence that Black boys are seen as older and less innocent and that they prompt a less essential conception of childhood than do their White same-age peers. Further, our findings demonstrate that the Black/ape association predicted actual racial disparities in police violence toward children.""

[Teachers More Likely to Label Black Students as Troublemakers](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/teachers-more-likely-to-label-black-students-as-troublemakers.html)  
""Across both studies, the researchers found that racial stereotypes shaped teachers’ responses not after the first infraction but rather after the second. Teachers felt more troubled by a second infraction they believed was committed by a black student rather than by a white student.  
In fact, the stereotype of black students as “troublemakers” led teachers to want to discipline black students more harshly than white students after two infractions, Eberhardt and Okonofua said. They were more likely to see the misbehavior as part of a pattern, and to imagine themselves suspending that student in the future.""

[Stereotyping across intersections of race and age: Racial stereotyping among White adults working with children](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201696)  
“Participants were 1022 White adults who volunteer and/or work with children in the United States who completed a cross-sectional, online survey. Results indicate high proportions of adults who work or volunteer with children endorsed negative stereotypes towards Blacks and other ethnic minorities. Respondents were most likely to endorse negative stereotypes towards Blacks, and least likely towards Asians (relative to Whites). Moreover, endorsement of negative stereotypes by race was moderated by target age. Stereotypes were often lower towards young children but higher towards teens.”

[Examining racial/ethnic disparities in school discipline in the context of student-reported behavior infractions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740918311095)  
“Engagement in particular behaviors had differential impact for African American vs. White students on the odds of receiving behavioral warnings, with African American students being less likely to be warned than their White peers. The current study demonstrates both the presence of disproportionality in non-exclusionary discipline as well as evidence that African American students experience escalated consequences (e.g., lower likelihood of receiving a warning) for infractions when they also engage in certain behaviors, even if those behaviors are not the direct cause for discipline.”

[Black Students Face More Discipline, Data Suggests](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/education/black-students-face-more-harsh-discipline-data-shows.html)  
""Although black students made up only 18 percent of those enrolled in the schools sampled, they accounted for 35 percent of those suspended once, 46 percent of those suspended more than once and 39 percent of all expulsions, according to the Civil Rights Data Collection’s 2009-10 statistics from 72,000 schools in 7,000 districts, serving about 85 percent of the nation’s students. The data covered students from kindergarten age through high school.""  
""Black and Hispanic students — particularly those with disabilities — are also disproportionately subject to seclusion or restraints. .... Black students with disabilities constituted 21 percent of the total, but 44 percent of those with disabilities subject to mechanical restraints, like being strapped down. And while Hispanics made up 21 percent of the students without disabilities, they accounted for 42 percent of those without disabilities who were placed in seclusion.""

[Breaking School’s Rules: A Statewide Study of How School Discipline Relates to Students’ Success and Juvenile Justice Involvement](https://csgjusticecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Breaking_Schools_Rules_Report_Final.pdf)  
“Multivariate analyses, which enabled researchers to control for 83 different variables in isolating the effect of race alone on disciplinary actions, found that African-American students had a 31 percent higher likelihood of a school discretionary action, compared to otherwise identical white and Hispanic students.”

""Black students accounted for 15 percent of the student body in the 2015-2016 school year but 31 percent of arrests. Two years earlier, black students accounted for 16 percent of the student body and 27 percent of arrests. The data also show students with disabilities are far more likely to face suspension or arrests at school. They accounted for 12 percent of enrollment but 28 percent of all arrests and referrals to law enforcement.  
A report from the Government Accountability Office released this month had similar findings, concluding that black students, boys and students with disabilities were overrepresented in disciplinary action: “These disparities were widespread and persisted regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school attended,” the GAO report said.""

""Although there were negligible differences among the racial groups in how frequently boys committed crimes, white boys were less likely to spend time in a facility than black and Hispanic boys who said they'd committed crimes just as frequently, as shown in the chart above.

""Black boys raised in America, even in the wealthiest families and living in some of the most well-to-do neighborhoods, still earn less in adulthood than white boys with similar backgrounds, according to a sweeping new study that traced the lives of millions of children.  
White boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way. Black boys raised at the top, however, are more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households.""  
“For poor children, the pattern is reversed. Most poor black boys  will remain poor as adults. White boys  raised in poor families fare far better.”

[Discrimination and the Effects of Drug Testing on Black Employment](https://www.nber.org/papers/w20095#fromrss)  
“Black employment in the testing sector is suppressed in the absence of testing, a finding which is consistent with ex ante discrimination on the basis of drug use perceptions. Adoption of pro-testing legislation increases black employment in the testing sector by 7-30% and relative wages by 1.4-13.0%, with the largest shifts among low skilled black men. Results further suggest that employers substitute white women for blacks in the absence of testing.”

This comparison demonstrates a strong racial hierarchy, with whites in the lead, followed by Latinos, with blacks trailing far behind.

The idea behind defunding the police is to put that money into community initiatives that actually support the mental and psychological health of the community.  Compare suburbs to inner-cities or white neighborhoods vs black neighborhoods. Why is one over policed and their youths go to jail while the other has made sure to put a lot funds in healthy initiatives for their youth? Considering I've seen many videos with police already assuming a group of young Black boys are criminals (based off both stats and stereotypes), the solution is to not keep throwing Black youth in jail but rather putting that money into community efforts that are wanted and severely needed. There should be a comprehensive way to address crime and community that doesn't result in the potential (children) being traumatized and made to think they're automatic targets as soon as they become teenagers. This goes way back to the Reagan era and the FBI finding ways to criminalize the Black community. Its deeper than you think."

251,fqphvdi,The bar is on the floor. There is substantial institutional racism here in Britain. For example when there was a fight outside my school when I was a kid and the white boys were sent home and the black boys were all arrested. Or when the black boys are repeatedly told in school in various ways that they're just going to end up in jail or dead thus creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Or when my friends partner had his jaw broken by police during a stop and search in which they found nothing anyway but he is a black man that drives a nice car so...

Results indicate high proportions of adults who work or volunteer with children endorsed negative stereotypes towards Blacks and other ethnic minorities. Respondents were most likely to endorse negative stereotypes towards Blacks, and least likely towards Asians (relative to Whites). Moreover, endorsement of negative stereotypes by race was moderated by target age. Stereotypes were often lower towards young children but higher towards teens.”

In fact, the stereotype of black students as “troublemakers” led teachers to want to discipline black students more harshly than white students after two infractions, Eberhardt and Okonofua said. They were more likely to see the misbehavior as part of a pattern, and to imagine themselves suspending that student in the future.""

[Stereotyping across intersections of race and age: Racial stereotyping among White adults working with children](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201696)  
“Participants were 1022 White adults who volunteer and/or work with children in the United States who completed a cross-sectional, online survey. Results indicate high proportions of adults who work or volunteer with children endorsed negative stereotypes towards Blacks and other ethnic minorities. Respondents were most likely to endorse negative stereotypes towards Blacks, and least likely towards Asians (relative to Whites). Moreover, endorsement of negative stereotypes by race was moderated by target age. Stereotypes were often lower towards young children but higher towards teens.”

&gt; Two juvenile judges found that student arrests and juvenile court referrals increase when SROs are present in schools. It is important to acknowledge that increased arrests do not necessarily mean that schools are safer. These judges also noted that a primary responsibility of police officers is to make arrests when there is probable cause. These probable cause judgments may be contributing to disparities in law enforcement referrals for specific racial groups. Indeed, another recent report found major disparities in school-based arrests of black and white students in North Carolina.

&gt; Last May 16, a massive water balloon fight broke out at Enloe. After a 911 call about the senior-day prank, the Raleigh Police Department dispatched 24 officers to restore order. The heightened security stemmed, in part, from the rumors that the balloons would be filled with urine and bleach. (Police and school officials would later say that there was no evidence of the balloons being filled with any substance other than water.)

&gt; In the end, eight Enloe students, all 16 to 17 years old, along with a parent, were arrested following events related to the water balloon fight.

&gt; In North Carolina, being arrested as a teenager has enormous consequences. It’s one of two states in the country that consider 16- and 17-year-olds to be adults when they are charged with a criminal offense and then deny them the chance to appeal for return to the juvenile system. The law means that misdemeanor charges stick on your permanent record.

&gt; Punitive discipline, referrals, and arrests are increasingly being accredited for contributing to the school-to-prison pipeline, an issue that the American Bar Association deemed “one of our nation’s most formidable challenges.” Furthermore, this use of enforcement officers in place of counselors can have harrowing effects on students’ lives. Reports have shown that schools with SROs are also more likely to refer students to law enforcement and juvenile systems as a form of discipline than schools without these officials. For example, students were five times more likely to get arrested for disorderly conduct in schools with officers than without."

[Stereotyping across intersections of race and age: Racial stereotyping among White adults working with children](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201696)  
“Participants were 1022 White adults who volunteer and/or work with children in the United States who completed a cross-sectional, online survey. Results indicate high proportions of adults who work or volunteer with children endorsed negative stereotypes towards Blacks and other ethnic minorities. Respondents were most likely to endorse negative stereotypes towards Blacks, and least likely towards Asians (relative to Whites). Moreover, endorsement of negative stereotypes by race was moderated by target age. Stereotypes were often lower towards young children but higher towards teens.”

[Black unemployment is significantly higher than white unemployment regardless of educational attainment](https://www.epi.org/publication/black-unemployment-educational-attainment/)  
“The black unemployment rate is nearly or more than twice the white unemployment rate regardless of educational attainment. It is, and always has been, about twice the white unemployment rate”"
267,f7gl7vd,"It's not subjective. Actual slaves were never paid reparations after the Civil War. In some cases, they were given land they'd worked on, only for it to be taken back by the white plantation owners (Andrew Johnson overturned the relevant bills, https://www.britannica.com/event/Reconstruction-United-States-history). Which meant that the social and economic dynamics remained unchanged, and the sharecropping that ensued in the South kept freed blacks in a slave-like position. Reparations aren't just about obtaining a cheque, they're about recognizing that even though it was ""a long time ago"", the direct effects of slavery were never addressed and *are still visible today.* (My take is funding more black community initiatives &amp; business, but that's neither here nor there.)

Of course some black people aren't going to suffer directly from discrimination, it's often dependent on location, socioeconomic status &amp; if you ""pass"" (I'm fairly advantaged in all 3 categories). They're *not necessarily* discriminated against, but they're more likely to be stopped by police (https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/findings/), are disproportionately represented in US prisons (33% of jail population vs 12% general, https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/30/shrinking-gap-between-number-of-blacks-and-whites-in-prison/), have longer prison sentences (https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2413&amp;context=articles), have less chances of upward mobility and less chances of staying at the top (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/02/14/no-room-at-the-top-the-stark-divide-in-black-and-white-economic-mobility/), have a much lower net worth compared to white families (1 in 5 have a zero or negative net worth, https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/recent-trends-in-wealth-holding-by-race-and-ethnicity-evidence-from-the-survey-of-consumer-finances-20170927.htm), are more likely to be unemployed (https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpsee_e16.htm), are less likely to be called back by prospective employers (https://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/w9873.html), etc. There are two explanations for these discrepancies: either black people are predisposed to put themselves in these situations, or there are several encompassing social tendencies that routinely disadvantage black people. If discrimination was a truly occasional phenomenon, the divide would either be much narrower, or the first option would be true.

&gt; cycle of poverty and violence

Basically, as I've touched upon before, a vast majority of black people left slavery without any kind of government help to ensure transition out of a deeply racist hierarchical system went smoothly. Rich white landowners of later decades would have it in their interest to keep black people poor &amp; uneducated, in order to keep their power and money. I'm getting tired so here's a list of grievances: majority black schools were and are underfunded, even in low-income districts (https://psmag.com/education/nonwhite-school-districts-get-23-billion-less-funding-than-white-ones); busing and school desegregation, which helped lower-income black kids attend richer white schools, while widely increasing prospects for black kids (https://gsppi.berkeley.edu/~ruckerj/johnson_schooldesegregation_NBERw16664.pdf), was slowly dismantled after white families fled to the suburbs in the 80s-90s; white flight was a systematic reaction to desegregation and the Civil Rights Movement, and is now reflected in the secession of new school districts which will exclude black students (https://phys.org/news/2019-09-school-district-secessions-south-deepened.html); the Southern Strategy is the proven method Republicans employed to encourage racism without directly referring to it, mostly by advocating tax cuts that would disproportionately affect blacks (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy#Roots_(1963%E2%80%931972)); the war on drugs was largely started to target hippies and black activists (https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-shocking-and-sickening-story-behind-nixons-war-on-drugs-that-targeted-blacks-and-anti-war-activists/), etc.

Then we can look at labeling theory, which argues that people who receive a label are likely to accept it and perpetuate it. Interestingly, black boys are overly targeted for disruptive behaviour in class (http://www.indiana.edu/~atlantic/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/African-American-Differential-Behavior_031214.pdf), giving credence to the idea that since they're labeled as delinquents early on in their childhood, they're less likely to have significant achievements later in life.

All this to say, there a significant academic body of work that suggests that black people in the US have a disadvantage in most areas of life. Either it's a result of complex social dynamics that are both purposely and subconsciously *not* in their favour, or they're just made that way. The former, in my opinion, is much more likely, and fortunately solvable. Denying the problem by pointing out the few people who've made it is pretty much putting on blinders.

­­­&gt; I thought lots of governments started doing stuff like gentrification.

I'm not sure what this is referring to. I think it's widely recognized that gentrification exacerbates class divides by displacing the low-income residents of a neighbourhood (and out of the view of those in power), and that's a phenomenon that most governments are neither legislating for nor against (afaik, if you have more info I'm into it)."
268,f9varar,"They less frequently are charged with crimes (compare the policing of drug related offenses for example), and when they do receive punishment its less severe. Hell it even goes down to the elementary school level where black boys are disciplined far more frequently than their white counterparts.

&amp;#x200B;

Bruh its not literally ALWAYS a get out of jail free card, but they don't get punished nearly as harshly. And in a sense they don't answer for their crimes. If they can get caught on video raping women and only get 6 months that's not fucking answering for your crimes when you're looking at 6+ years usually for doing the crime."
269,f57ygtf,"I saw this a few days ago, and (aside from it being horrendous) I can see both sides of showing vs. not showing the video.

One the one hand, I can see why someone would support releasing the bodycam/video - because SO OFTEN black people (especially black women, especially YOUNG black girls) are never believed when this shit goes on. It needs to be shown every single time so there's NO QUESTION that ""yes, this happens ALL. THE. TIME"" and ""no, it happened for NO DAMN REASON"".

I can also see on the other hand about NOT showing this video - these types of videos are ""crime porn"" for some demonic monsters where black women + girls in pain/being abused feeds into their supremacist fever dream.

I'm torn on that issue, but mostly heartbroken for this child, because in no way did she ask for or deserve this. If it was my kid, hooo - I literally wouldn't rest until that asshole was fired, in jail, the school administrators that let this shit go on were fired/in jail...\*\*scorched earth\*\*, nothing less.

272,f22noyd,"If I had to guess, take a look which groups are most accounted for in the massive spike in suicides in the US over the past decade. Same with the opiate issue. Probably a correlation there. These people (said demographic), say gen x and forward, were probably primed with high expectations in their youth and for many of them that reality was coldly shattered and they're reaching a point of hopelessness and frankly despair.  And with that comes resentment towards the world that swallowed their lives and hopes.  Black boys are used to it. They didn't come in expecting much, so working 3 min wage jobs 70+ hours a week to still barely pay rent is just what they do. It's better than being stuck in one of the US's penal colonies, like such a huge percentage of their demographic already is (black = literally an order of magnitude more likely to be arrested). System is crushing people, and in the US poverty is criminalized, so for most if you go broke you eventually end up in and out of jail at the very least, and often after you're grabbed a few times for whatever trumped up shit like ""trespassing"" is a very common one for homeless people, end up in prison, and once in that system there's a big chance you're never getting all the way out.

279,etpktu8,"&gt;Where’s the racism here?

The first link you provided includes several explanations, such as:

&gt; In many cases black schoolchildren are taught by white teachers who have low opinions of the abilities of black kids from the moment they enter the classroom. These teachers immediately write off black students as academic inferiors and do not challenge them sufficiently to achieve the skills necessary to perform well on standardized tests.

And

&gt;Black students may be subject to what Stanford psychology professor Claude Steele calls ""stereotype vulnerability."" Steele contends that black students are aware of the fact that society expects them to perform poorly on standardized tests. This added pressure put upon black students to perform well in order to rebut the racial stereotype in fact makes it more difficult for them to perform well on these tests.

And

&gt;School administrators and guidance counselors often believe that black students are less capable and less able to learn. They routinely track black students at an early age into vocational training or into a curriculum that is not college preparatory. Black students are rarely recommended for inclusion in gifted education, honors, or Advanced Placement programs. Once placed on the slow academic track, most black kids can never escape. By the time black students are juniors and seniors in high school, they are typically so far behind their white counterparts in the critical subject areas necessary to perform well on standardized tests that they have little hope of ever matching the scores of whites on the SAT.

---------

I'm not saying that cultural influence is non-existent, but it wasn't formed in a vacuum. It's a result of racism. Of stereotypes and teacher expectations. Being put in a juvenile detention center instead of given a warning. Any child who gets treated like this is probably going to become discouraged, they're not going to support their peers, and when they grow up they are less likely to emphasize the importance of school to their children.

Beyond school and adolescence, there is even more discrimination, particularly in regards to employment and treatment by police. White people are more likely to get away with a crime like possession of marijuana because they're less likely to be stopped by police, and if caught they're less likely to see jail time, and if sentenced their sentence is likely to be shorter than it is for black people. That means they're less likely to lose their job (if they don't go to jail), less likely to fall behind on their bills, and less likely to adapt to prison culture or make criminal associations.

This all has a huge impact on the socioeconomic disparities between black people and white people."

Black men with a bachelor's degree or more and who had 11 to 20 years of work experience made 27.2% less than whites with the same level of education and experience. Black women with a bachelor's degree or more and 11 to 20 years of work experience were paid 10.6% less than white women.  
Recent college graduates with less than ten years of work experience also saw gaps in earnings by race. Black women with a bachelor's degree alone were paid 10.7% less than white women, while black men with the same credentials were paid 18% less than their white counterparts.”"

Just because such people exist does not mean white privilege does not exist. Among black people there are many people who are driven enough, talented enough, and lucky enough to succeed despite the disadvantages they face due to their skin color. And among white people there are many who would fail if those same disadvantages were applied to them.

On an individual level, everyone should try their best to succeed. But when you apply a racial disadvantage to large numbers, many people who otherwise would have ""made it"" will not.

This bias toward white people is real and it is prevalent.

"
287,ecofwdw,"Why? 

Many reasons. Let's start with one of the strongest reasons: family. **Most** black children live in single-parent households. 

That is a horrifying statistic!

A white kid who grows up in a single-parent household is more likely to end up in jail than a black kid who grows up in a two-parent household.

The problem is family, or lack thereof. This factor is way *way* more significant than race. 

So instead of focusing on what's important and more statistically significant, you're focusing on discrimination, which is a weak argument at best. 

You could also look at sex. Did you know that black girls are actually doing well? The problem is boys. When you split the data into male/female, the differences are incredible. Why is this? Isn't that an important question to answer? And the sentencing disparity for men vs women is actually much larger than black vs white. There's something cultural going on here, and it ain't about race. 

Race is a red herring. It ignores what's important or statistically significant. When you look at other factors, like income, family structure, sex, drug use, and more, it turns out that this isn't really a discussion about race."

&gt;The lower ranks of the US military are disproportionately made up of POC. It's part of why Trump was trying to block military overseas votes in Florida.

&gt;With that in mind, consider that the US as an institution keeps POC disenfranchised and impoverished, making military service not only an appealing option to not die hungry in the street, but sometimes the only option to not die hungry in the street. Also, all of the instances where 17-year-old black boys are given the option to go to prison for five years over a blunt, or military service.

&gt;So, we've got the whole US political machine forcing POC into impossible situations, and then the 16-25 woke white male gamer Chapo demographic says, ""fuck all the troops.""

&gt;Maybe it's just boot polish, but that leaves a weird taste in my mouth.

seems to put it well. i live in the UK where it is more of a class divide than race divide, but that seems to be basically the same issue of proletariat vs elite."
290,e1exadd,"In a country where black people are gunned down by police for talking on a phone in their grandmother's backyard, where they're killed, again by police by being denied meds when they're thrown in jail, for no good reason, where teenage black girls are tackled by the swimming pool by police for doing nothing other than white teenage girls, you bet this is racist. Racist to the core. Because everything exists in a context. So, yeah, I don't have sympathy for her.

292,dvpqdfk,"People under 18, especially Black boys, are charged as adults all the time. The school to prison pipeline means many of these students could land in jail for things that students in white suburban schools do every day. "
293,dsd7c1y,"Don't you know? All black boys are thugs, gangstas, gangbangers, dealers, thieves, murderers, rapists, in the making. They don't deserve compassion or help. Just send em to jail.

All white boys, unless properly cucked and feminized, or forcibly transitioned into females, are future mass-shooters and Nazi scum. They are the devil. They are inherently evil and toxic. They deserve no redemption.

And if you don't think so, you're a misogynist/racist/Nazi scum who condones rape and genocide."
294,dssp2fh,"&gt;Eleven. The US Bureau of Justice Statistics concludes that the chance of a black male born in 2001 of going to jail is 32% or 1 in three. Latino males have a 17% chance and white males have a 6% chance. Thus black boys are five times and Latino boys nearly three times as likely as white boys to go to jail.

Again, we have been over this. Pointing out that black people are more likely to commit crime is not an example of institutional racism.

&gt;Twelve. So, while African American juvenile youth is but 16% of the population, they are 28% of juvenile arrests, 37% of the youth in juvenile jails and 58% of the youth sent to adult prisons. 2009 Criminal Justice Primer, The Sentencing Project.

That this guy unironically posted this is beyond me. The same point.. Again.. 

&gt;Thirteen. Remember that the US leads the world in putting our own people into jail and prison. The New York Times reported in 2008 that the US has five percent of the world’s population but a quarter of the world’s prisoners, over 2.3 million people behind bars, dwarfing other nations. The US rate of incarceration is five to eight times higher than other highly developed countries and black males are the largest percentage of inmates according to ABC News.

... Again, really? This guy must have some rare type of Alzheimer's. This is about the 10th time he made the exact same point and called it a different example.

&gt;Fourteen. Even when released from prison, race continues to dominate. A study by Professor Devah Pager of the University of Wisconsin found that 17% of white job applicants with criminal records received call backs from employers while only 5% of black job applicants with criminal records received call backs. Race is so prominent in that study that whites with criminal records actually received better treatment than blacks without criminal records!

What kind of criminal records?

What kind of education did the job applicants have?

What kind of skills? 

Where is the study?

295,dnj2r9o,"&gt;Actually the only one that would make it end very differently is if she was a he.

This is false. It dramatically overstates your position. The four criteria at issue are: young, white, ""pretty,"" and female. If she was older, she'd have been more likely to go to jail. If she was a racial minority, she'd have been more likely to go to jail. If she was male, she'd have been more likely to go to jail. Statistics are completely indisputable on all three of those points. There are no statistics on ""pretty,"" but I'm still sticking with it. 

&gt;Ugly black girls are still much less likely to be arrested, charged, tried, convicted, and sentenced to prison than white men

That's certainly true as far as it goes, but it changes *two* variables: race and sex. Limit the change to only one variable, race, and the difference is still there. According to the DOJ Bureau of Justice Statistics, [black women are incarcerated at nearly *twice* the rate of white women](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p15.pdf) (Appendix Table 4, p. 30). Similarly, people aged 20-24 are, across the board, less likely to be incarcerated than similarly-situated people aged 25-49. This can be a difference of up to 100% depending on sex and racial factors. 

There are, of course, no statistics for how physically attractive criminal defendants are. That's more a gut instinct, but it's one commonly shared in the criminal defense bar.

Edit: Thinking more on it, how does this ""boys will be boys"" shit work? I goddamn knew better at 14 years old than to fucking lynch someone. I knew better at 19 than to fucking rape a drunk woman behind a dumpster (Brock Turner). ""Boys will be boys"" when they accidentally throw a ball through a window and run off or when they break an arm doing some dumb shit, not when they commit felonies, Jesus Christ.

297,dlltggf,"Sure, everyone’s outraged about the violence, about the public display of hate.  And so everyone’s rushing to distance themselves from it, to say they’re not a part of it and it’s not a part of them, of us, of America.  And a few statues will come down, and maybe a couple of ‘bad eggs’ will go to jail, and in two weeks, after we’ve all had our kumbaya moment, white America will pat itself on the back for having solved racism once again and will move on and forget.

And it won’t matter that people still discriminate against black people because they have ‘weird names’ or that young black girls are sexualized at an early age, or that young black boys aren’t seen as innocent, or that black women are called manly welfare queens and black men animals, or that by almost every metric available, black people continue to be disadvantaged and disenfranchised.  It won’t matter that white people don’t even think we feel pain as much as they do.  It won’t matter when someone says you’re so well-spoken (for a black person), you’re so pretty (for a black girl), you’re one of the good ones.  It’ll be considered pandering when black people are added to films, it’ll be considered necessary when white people replace black people in films.  When yet another police officer kills yet another unarmed black person, they’ll say they feared for their lives and the nation will agree it’s a shame that black person had to be so black.  And then, when we’ve added another thousand drops of water to fountain of apathy and devaluation, when that finally floods over into the streets as it is wont to do every decade or so, they’ll clutch their pearls, aghast, and condemn the people overtly doing what they’ve always covertly been encouraged, and say, this behavior, which America has quietly, consistently, systematically encouraged, is not American when in fact, it’s the most American thing in the world."
298,djpbu2r,"My thoughts: 

- They jumped the shark this season with the Litchfield idol and anal stuff on the guard and them seemingly taking forever to get back the prison even with shots fired. The idol stuff was clever and all, but no way that happens in reality.

- They gave way too much credit to the prisoners in it. In real life, that prison would have had various gangs going after each other, there would have been a lot more escapes and people would have created a black market on the food. There would have also been some deaths as the inmates would beat the crap out of each other. 

- I mentioned this, but there's no way the prisoners wouldn't all try to escape immediately in a powerless riot situation. That'd be the first thing they would do. And many of the guards like Donuts passed up chances to get out of there.

- They stretched out the riot way too long. I expected a few episodes, not a full season. It did not need to go 13 episodes. 

-  This is the 2nd time I think in the show that the jail has lost all control.

- The stuff with the cell phone chargers hurt the show too. There's no way those phones last for 2 days straight with people uploading youtube videos.

-  I know this is TV and all, but no one put up any video cameras anywhere in the prison to see what was going on? Really? Not even for security reasons?

- A lot of those girls should be doing a lot of time for the various incidents. Some of the girls in the pool might be the only ones who would be free. The Nazi's are going away for a long time. The methheads are going away for a long time. All of the latinas are going away for a long time. All of the black girls are going away for a long time, etc.

- The DOJ visitor girl shouldn't have to worry as when they go to process her, they'll release her. I found her to be a bit unbelievable this season.

- I didn't like the flashbacks much this season. I FF'd through reds and didn't really get Piper's. I didn't also like the scene at the rich white school. Yes, screw them for having rich parents who can afford to send them to nice places.

My thoughts for next season:

- In reality, there should be a ton of trials and court sessions over what went down. 

- They are definitely going to have to cut some people for next season when they likely have all new cellmates. Way too many characters. 

- This can't be the end of Litchfield as that would cut a lot of characters, but there's no way those guards could or would go back. 

- We didn't see the admin who went to the psych hospital at all this season. Completely skipped over."

Can't have young black women thinking they can speak up like Michelle or Angela Davis.

301,fxdabbp,""" Both statements are racist because both generalize about a racial group. Either way, you're saying that black girls tend to be ""ghetto"" or ""hood rats,"" which is a generalization about a racial group and is thus racist.

We don't know what precisely he means by ghetto though. He could be talking about class, or lack of tact, or just the style of clothes they wear?

If he has drawn the conclusion that black girls are likely to be too ghetto for his tastes due to previous encounters with them, and that therefore he shouldn't bother dating black girls, that is not racism; that is a strategic calculation on his part because he wants to save his time for what he sees as more worthwhile endeavors.

"" ""young black women...do not typically possess said qualities...""  ""

Question: is the phrase 'Most ethnic Jews do not consume pork' racist, or merely a matter of using your fucking brain? Generalizations such as these, are most frequently born of a shard of truth, no matter how distorted. You know that ""racist stereotype"" of Asians outperforming whites academically? *That's because it holds some truth to it.* Saying blacks are **typically** 'ghetto' is merely a matter of applied statistics given their above-baseline poverty rates. Saying blacks are ALL ghetto is a matter of genuine racism-and we don't even know for sure if he said exactly that, much less meant exactly what he said.

It's clear from the outset that the woman's intent is no less to indoctrinate him into the idea that racial identity is even remotely significant(and beyond that to become an activist rather than just seeing himself as an individual- look carefully as she claims the father raised him ""To be just white"". Who said the father had focused him him being white, rather than his son just being raised as a reasonable fucking human being?

It'd be one thing if she just gave the son a book or two about black culture, or perhaps took him out to a lounge that played ""Black British music""(Whatever the fuck that means) or something relatively open and noninvasive, but once you start trying to take people to political protests it's pretty much an attempt at influence of some sort, no matter how benignly it is conducted(And that is being deliberately generous regarding how forceful her daughter may or may not have been, but given her hissy fit at hearing what he said, I really should assume worse).

The racism is in thinking all other black girls will be ""too ghetto.""  If I encounter a few racist white people and then say all white people are racist, that's hardly fair of me, right?  Same thing here.  Saying all black girls are ""too ghetto"" because those you've met were ""too ghetto"" is inherently racist because it involves generalizing about a racial group based on a small sample and no additional evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Again, the woman who is herself clearly biased and possibly an unreliable narrator playing telephone through what is likely an *even more unreliable* narrator might not have given us the exact wording the son said.

For the most part, I think that's fair to say.  However, I doubt she would put such specific words into the son's mouth like that.  Unless I get more information, this is the best I can go off of.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That being said, there is also another part of the rationalization at play; generalizations, even those otherwise thought racist, are not innately malicious.

Of course not.  I never said they are.  The racism isn't just in making a generalization; it's in making a generalization about a racial group based on a small sample.  And even then, it's often not explicitly malicious; subconscious bias is present in all of us.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Generalizations are not set-in-stone rules, but fill in the blank placeholders you use to hedge your bets while you try to find out more about a specific individual. I believe it is this, not some fundamentally discriminatory hard-edged absolutist rule the son is employing, that the son is using to make his decision.

I'm not saying he was being intentionally malicious here.  However, the fact that he generalized about such a large and varied group based on such a small sample is what makes it racist.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Question: is the phrase 'Most ethnic Jews do not consume pork' racist, or merely a matter of using your fucking brain? 

Well of course that's not racist because there's additional evidence at play.  Most people who are ethnically Jewish are religiously Jewish (there's data on this), and one of the tenets of religious Judaism is not eating pork.  You didn't generalize based on a small sample; you drew a conclusion based on actual data and evidence.  The son is this scenario did not have any such evidence or data, though.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Generalizations such as these, are most frequently born of a shard of truth, no matter how distorted.

Not always.  In fact, stereotypes often come about as a way for those in power to remain in power and oppress others.  Take, for example, the stereotypes of black people as unintelligent and uncivilized that were used to justify slavery.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You know that ""racist stereotype"" of Asians outperforming whites academically? *That's because it holds some truth to it.*

There's actual evidence here, though.  You can show me data to support that claim.  You cannot show me data that black girls are ""too ghetto.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Saying blacks are **typically** 'ghetto' is merely a matter of applied statistics given their above-baseline poverty rates.

Show me the statistics that prove that black girls are ""too ghetto.""  For that matter, how would you even define or measure how ""ghetto"" a person is?  That's just nonsensical; it's a charged and derogatory term.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;She's trying to indirectly shoehorn the son into getting involved with a different crowd of people, the daughter even tries to railroad him into DATING different people, not to mention the daughter even tried to get the son to attend a fucking POLITICAL PROTEST and you want to argue there is no attempt at indoctrination?

Encouraging a friend or family member to do something new is not indoctrination.  He said no, and so he didn't have to go.  He wasn't being forced to go.  Introducing someone to new people is not indoctrination and, again, he had the choice to say no, which he did.

Also, the BLM protests should hardly be considered 'political.'  People are just asking for rights and equality.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's clear from the outset that the woman's intent is no less to indoctrinate him into the idea that racial identity is even remotely significant(and beyond that to become an activist rather than just seeing himself as an individual- look carefully as she claims the father raised him ""To be just white"". Who said the father had focused him him being white, rather than his son just being raised as a reasonable fucking human being?

That intent doesn't seem clear to me at all.  It seems you're just trying to read in some anti-white narrative when there is none.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It'd be one thing if she just gave the son a book or two about black culture, or perhaps took him out to a lounge that played ""Black British music""(Whatever the fuck that means) or something relatively open and noninvasive, but once you start trying to take people to political protests it's pretty much an attempt at influence of some sort, no matter how benignly it is conducted(And that is being deliberately generous regarding how forceful her daughter may or may not have been, but given her hissy fit at hearing what he said, I really should assume worse).

Again, no one's trying to make him do anything.  It seems his decisions are being more or less respected.  I would take issue if they forced him to do something, but that's just not what seems to be happening here.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also pay attention to her reaction when she hears her daughter relay what the son said- her immediate reaction is to talk to his father to get him to ""talk to his son"" *about his fucking dating preferences*! Does that not seem even remotely hamfisted to you?

Like my original comment said, I don't think the dating preference itself is the problem.  Instead, it's his justification, his conclusion that black girls are ""too ghetto"" that's the problem.  We're all allowed to have preferences; just don't be racist in your preferences."
303,fxfdtye,"&gt;Yeah, but in those cases the stereotypes were inferred to be universal and were not backed by actual statistics or necessarily naturally occurring.

Yeah, and the same thing is being done here.  There's no evidence that black girls are ""too ghetto.""  He's generalizing without any real evidence.  His only 'evidence' is the black girls he's met, but that doesn't generalize to all black girls.  Racial groups are not monoliths.  Thinking that they are and that a small sample size generalizes to the entire group is racist.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you want to argue a conspiracy theory, **you need to explain the actual conspiracy to us.**

No one's arguing a conspiracy theory here lol.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Let's start with an easy one: Is it indeed true that black people have above average levels of poverty, something linked to the ""Ghetto"" lifestyle?

It is true that black people in America tend to be less wealthy and more impoverished; I can show you the data on that (this is largely due to systemic racism, but that's off-topic).  However, this isn't linked to the ""ghetto lifestyle.""  You're just introducing a new stereotype that poor people live ""ghetto lifestyle\[s\]"" without any evidence that that is the case."
304,fxfmjlx,""" Yeah, and the same thing is being done here. There's no evidence that black girls are ""too ghetto."" He's generalizing without any real evidence. His only 'evidence' is the black girls he's met, but that doesn't generalize to all black girls. Racial groups are not monoliths. Thinking that they are and that a small sample size generalizes to the entire group is racist. ""

No evidence? His own experience count as evidence in his own personal context, though certainly not bulletproof scientific evidence as we may use the term for in general. IN addition, you literally put the dots together yourself on why he thinks that black is associated with ghetto and the STATISTICAL EVIDENCE on racial inequity that reinforces this notion.

"" No one's arguing a conspiracy theory here lol.""  
The minute you started comparing modern racial stereotypes to those of the Civil War era-and claiming that some faceless group of whites are intentionally perpetuating them-it became painfully clear that you're arguing what effectively amounts to a conspiracy theory.

"" However, this isn't linked to the ""ghetto lifestyle."" You're just introducing a new stereotype that poor people live ""ghetto lifestyle\[s\]"" without any evidence that that is the case. ""

Poverty isn't linked to the ghetto lifestyle? The fuck?

Well, I suppose there hasn't exactly been any empirical studies on the demographics of the ""ghetto lifestyle"" confirming this, there sure as hell aren't any studies forming a negative association either, so we basically have to use our eyes. You act like these stereotypes come out of thin air but they simply fucking don't- they are common assessments formed(and shared) by many members of a given population via lived experiences. OF COURSE, they don't exactly have scientific-grade accuracy and they should never be used to establish set-in-stone rules for how ALL subjects of a given race act-and indeed if a generalization does establish itself as an absolute, infallible assessment regarding people of a given race it may very well be a ""racist stereotype"", but if you don't have better information on a given individual there is nothing evil about using those generalizations to fill in the gap until better information is presented-and if they, of course, recognize the fallibility of said generalizations.

The son from the story may actually recognize the fallibility of his generalization, but assess it as accurate enough to rule out black dating partners to focus his time on other potential partners. There's nothing ""racist"" about it in the sense of being Klansman-like at all."

When he relayed this story to a white cousin the cousin asked why he didn't just ignore the cop and ride away because the cop had no reason to pull him over. I'm currently teaching my 16 year old and 15 year old how to drive and my 15 year old makes jokes about how if he messes up he'll end up under a police officer's knee.

308,fvccpdy,"&gt; These kids don't see value in education because their parent(s) don't.

It's a tough argument to say that parent's don't value *education* - I think it's more they don't value the particular education offered to their children. Either way, that's just kicking the can down the road (or back in time). What caused the education offered by the city to be devalued? And more importantly, what could be done today to attract those people back to education? We *have* to do that. Again, the solution offered by the criminal justice system is way more expensive and unsustainable. 

&gt; It's not the right answer though because if it was we would have seen a boost in education outcomes.

I have heard of many ways to boost outcomes. You mentioned the issue with ""proper grammar"" earlier. Well, educators tried addressing the difference between ""proper"" and ""local"" english by using [a curriculum that recognized the existence of ""Ebonics"" as a method to teach what is to most kids](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/michael-hobbes/youre-wrong-about/e/59847205), a way of speaking and writing that is very different than what is spoken at home. I am sure there are other methods that could be brought to bear that would also be useful and [advocacy organizations have outlined them here.](http://www.aqeny.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/exec-budget-side-by-side-with-AQE-1.25.18-1.pdf)

&gt; Our public schools are failing the kids because of externalities they can't control or influence.

Can you go further into that?

&gt; Why are you assuming this is only a problem with the undocumented immigrants? This sounds like you're just imparting your own biases here, and in a way that makes you sound like a dickhead too since you're making assumptions about me.

The ""deep right-wing fantasies"" I am aware of would encompass and impact all people of color in an attempt to create a Whites-Only nation. It permeates everywhere from their writings to the punchline of their jokes (""So the Blacks are in their own country? And the Jews are in their own country? Then my wish is for a Diet Coke."")  It's got nothing to do with documentation. 

Also, I don't know anything about you and don't think I have made any assumptions about you. So let's throttle back on the name calling. 

&gt; You're shifting goalposts here going from education to criminality, but if you want to fix that then we'll fix it the same way we fix education:

""If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately."" - Former SecDef Mattis on, 

If we don't fix education then we gotta fund criminal justice to deal with the inevitable results. That's a pretty clear see-saw. 

&gt; Look at any of the recent shootings in the city involving those under 18 as the gunman every one of those kids grows up exactly the same: single parent household with multiple brothers and sisters by different fathers/mothers, barely attends school or gave up on education, no positive role models, and got pulled into gang life between 10-15 years old when they were most impressionable.

I think there are still some ways to fix education. Examples:

[Black students, boys, and students with disabilities were disproportionately disciplined (e.g., suspensions and expulsions) in K-12 public schools, according to GAO's analysis of Department of Education (Education) national civil rights data for school year 2013-14, the most recent available. These disparities were widespread and persisted regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school attended. For example, Black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school—an overrepresentation of about 23 percentage points (see figure).](https://www.gao.gov/mobile/products/GAO-18-258)

Or

[Black girls do not present more frequent or serious discipline problems. They are not slower learners; nor do they struggle academically more than any other student. But according to a new report from the National Women’s Law Center, black girls are twice as likely as any other student to be suspended, and 5.5 times more likely to be temporarily kicked out of school than their white counterparts.](https://www.theroot.com/report-black-girls-5-times-more-likely-to-be-suspended-1795125619)

I agree that there are a lot of problems to be worked on, but more/better cops running around funneling more people in the criminal justice system seems so short-sighted to me. That gang member arrested at 16 with a poor education is gonna do what at 26? Go where at 36? And so forth."
309,fyydczn,"
&gt; Couldn't have said this any better myself. 

&gt; Tucker Carlson advocates for a society that is a ""colorblind meritocracy."" Do you agree with the second part of that sentiment if we attain your dream?

If we have addressed the real racial disparities, then I would say absolutely.  In general I think the most qualified person should be in charge.  


 

&gt; (I promise my intention is not to do that with this next point even though it might come across like that) Are you familiar with Leo Terrell? What do you think of this op-ed he wrote? 

I have heard of him but not too familiar with him.

I think his opinion piece is ok. I disagree with him for a few reasons though.

1.  I don't think Black Lives Matter is an organization meant to address *all* issues that Black people face. Though the name can suggest that, its real goal is to end police brutality and more specifically, racially charged police brutality. That said, this has expanded to other facets of society which may enable or perpetuate systemic racism of some form. Which brings me to my second point -

2.  Some communities *do* have organizations that are working to curb this violence. It can be extremely hard to work things out without resources though. **I do however wish that these programs received the same amount of attention and resources BLM has.**

3. Dismissing the clearly serious issue of police brutality that BLM is trying to address simply because BLM isn't addressing *other* issues is bizarre to me.

4. ""Black on Black"" crime is not an institution with racial bias, nor is it a government institution. These Black people aren't killing Black people because they're racist. Which brings me to my 5th point 

5. We see that there are multiple correlating factors to crime. These factors are the War on Drugs, poverty, population density, lack of education, and single parent households. And sometimes, more often than we would like to think, these are issues that can happen *at the same time.* For instance, picture a poor neighborhood comprised of densely populated tenements. Now imagine a 16 year old girl from that community who becomes pregnant and is perhaps unable to even get her high school diploma, much less a degree. Now imagine she starts using drugs and now her situation is treated more like a criminal affront rather than a public health emergency. Imagine what kind of environment that creates for a young Black child. All of these, as far as I understand, have been conditions placed on Black people in America for *lifetimes.* After being heavily oppressed between 1619 and 1965 (and even throughout the 80s and 90s as gang violence and the drug crisis became extremely bad), it shouldn't be a shock to see how Black communities across the country are in shambles. Poverty in this country often leads to living in densely populated apartment complexes. Gangs are a social phenomenon created by systemic racism. The War on Drugs is something that Nixon's aide has explicitly admitted was an attack on Black people. Education (and not just math and science but also sex ed, understanding the law, etc) is severely underfunded in many Black communities and so on and so forth. Nobody even considers that these Black boys are *clearly* in need of mental professionals and better support systems but they're very quickly painted as mindless savages. My point is that Black people have dealt with very harsh social conditions and their communities are often demonized for the results. Rather than ignorantly saying ""Black on Black crime"" to dismiss BLM, people should try to find solutions that address the issues that correlate to said crime.

&gt;I think black people commit more crime for several reasons, one of them being cyclical poverty (which affects everyone, not just black people). Another reason is that 77% of black boys are being raised without a father. The main role models that black kids have in pop culture also glorify gang culture.

I agree with all of this complety. The only thing I'd add is that although cyclical poverty affects everyone, the clear existing signs of systematic racism (which doesn't require bad actors, i.e active racists) the African American will find it harder to break the cycle.

&gt;I don’t think that there’s a significant amount of racist cops to explain the discrepancy.

You've just not looked in the right place, either by innocence or ignorance. For one, many studies show that black people are also more likely to be stopped by police. Stanford University social psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt, PhD, and colleagues analyzed data from the police department in Oakland, California, and found that while black residents make up 28 percent of the Oakland population, they accounted for 60 percent of police stops. What's more, black men were four times more likely than white men to be searched during a traffic stop, even though officers were no more likely to recover contraband when searching black suspects (Stanford SPARQ, 2016).

In an analysis of national police-­shootings data from 2011–14, for example, Cody T. Ross, a doctoral student in anthropology at the University of California, Davis, concluded there is ""evidence of a significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans relative to unarmed white Americans."" The probability of being black, unarmed and shot by police is about 3.5 times the probability of being white, unarmed and shot by police, he found (PLOS One, 2015). 

Those disparities don't seem to arise from the fact that black Americans are more likely to commit crimes. Sorry for the long post, hopefully you took the time to read this all. 

The ultimate issue is that American police training is pathetic. Here in Europe it takes literal years of training to become an officer; those with implicit biases usually lose them or fail. In America you can become a police force member in a matter of weeks."

317,fhak9xo,"There are some black girls that aren’t like this and it actually makes them attractive but they than have all the shitty qualities liberal women have.

Latinas have the same issues. Latina’s aren’t crazy they just come from a culture where a Latina is used to dominant males so if you’re a bitch they’ll treat you like one. Again at the other end of the spectrum you have the progressive Latina’s who are somewhat woke, but still crazy after a weekend at home.

We are a society that is being engineered. Liberals want us to all turn into woke versions of them. We are seeing the conflicts in this integration first hand when it comes to liberalism trying to mesh with 1920s rural Mexican culture, black inner city/rural culture and even Islamic culture. Mostly non secular cultures do well when it comes to integrating with liberalism and progressives. 

There’s a lot of theories as to why black culture keeps staying in a loop of crime and poverty. My take based on pure conjecture is that non secular liberalism is rather intimidating. When you’re poor and you’re sitting across the table from someone who’s culture is light years ahead of yours you’re going to revert to what feels safe. Drugs are easy money and an equalizer when it comes to money. Violence makes you dominant in the face of knowledge (no matter how useless the other persons knowledge is). Hip hop just ties it all together.

The irony in all this is woke liberals children running towards hip hop. In a way regressing themselves into a violence driven culture their forefathers looked to escape from. 

It wasn’t that long ago that American culture was more in line with the western cowboy and the army boys in the north defeating the south. With the growth of the federal government, the expansion of American infrastructure, the robber barons and roaring 20s: came the end of all that. Blacks were a part of this “evolution” too but ironically have been held back by the same people they allied themselves with—all for the new deal. To expand on how democrats kept this systematic inequality going just look up Jim Crow laws.  

You could also take what I said above and tie it to drug culture and drug ballads when it comes to Latinos; except there’s a divergence here. A lot of this comes from illegal immigrants and Latinos from rural Mexico. Their culture is still highly religious, based on traditional roles and for the most part conservative. A contrast to this is, Argentinians—coming from a more liberal culture they integrate quickly into America’s liberal fortresses. The same can be said of Mexicans from their capital or Guadalajara; but only to an extent as the cities themselves can be subdivided into secular and non secular zones. 

In short black girls are manly af because their environment has made them that way—an environment perpetuated by American liberalism."
318,fkvfbqf,"It's difficult to separate privilege between wealth and race, since they tend to be so closely linked.

320,fezwzlo,"Thank you so much for adding this, its all really important information. I should also note some issues with corporal punishment in schools. Those defending the practice state it is used far more rarely than it was, and is more controlled. But even they are unable to explain the system on the ground where it happens. In the 19 states where it is legal the amount and severity of corporal punishment has gone down overall. But its either legal or its not, in the states where it is the schools are all still run like any other school, which is to say with an enormous amount of local control. So the practice of spanking and paddling can be, and is, common and widespread in some schools individually and locally, largely based on the principal, the school board, and in some cases the PTA's opinion on the matter. Also it should be noted that the practice of spanking and paddling in schools is long shown to be a racist and ableist policy, based on every conceivable measure. The Southern Poverty Law Center has an excellent article on the subject. 

https://www.splcenter.org/20190611/striking-outlier-persistent-painful-and-problematic-practice-corporal-punishment-schools

It is truly appalling. Research shows that black children do not mis-behave more often than white children, and disabled children need support if their acting out, as if it needed to be said. But black boys are paddled at a rate of two times that of white boys, and black girls are paddled at a rate of three times that of white girls, and children with disabilities are paddled at substantially higher rates as well. 

And even if defenders of the system are saying its rarer than it used to be, its still certainly not rare. In Mississippi for example the rate of paddling or spanking across the whole student body on average was 9.3 percent per school year. That is to say most children across the board will be paddled or spanked who attend school in Mississippi as an average. And that higher rate for disabled and black students still applies, creating a situation where the average, normal white student will still likely be paddled at some point, and the average, normal black or disabled student will be paddled multiple times, no matter how obedient children are on average. 

It could be truly hideous for children who due to whatever issues they have mentally or at home were actual disciplinary problems. The policies are already so hideous, and can be proven so harmful to the developing brain of children, and its widespread across all these states, in particular schools it could be very bad indeed. And then when we know it targets kids based on disability and race, its impossible to understand why this is still allowed. In the home was always harder to fight, many countries only changed their laws regarding spanking in the home in the last decade. 

But school spanking was done away with in all the western countries 30 odd years ago, and just persists in those 19 states. At least with the home the US, as awful and wrong as it is, has some logic to it, the English still allow it, and Canada does to a limited degree. But in schools is madness, its not done anywhere else that is even remotely as well off or advanced as the US. There are numerous poor countries on that list of spanking ban countries where the government has no real way of enforcing such a law, and don't. But at least their governments are forward thinking, and created the damned law. Allowing it in schools is appalling lunacy under any circumstances, there is simply no defense for it. Thank you so much for adding this helpful information to help get the information out there, its really just awesome."
321,fb04vic,"That's very racist. You might try befriending some black women and learn a thing or two. 

Also, here's some sources on racism against black women. You'd probably be mad if you walked in her shoes for a day. 

&gt; In 2017, for example, **Black women earned 61 cents for every dollar earned by white men, amounting to $23,653 less in earnings over an entire year.** In the span of a 40-year career, this translates into an average lifetime earnings gap of $946,120 between Black women and white men.

&gt; Researchers with the Initiative on Gender Justice and Opportunity at **Georgetown Law’s Center on Poverty and Inequality** spoke directly to black girls and women across the country about how they are forced to deal with harmful perceptions — like that black girls are more mature and less in need of protection than other students — from a young age.

&gt; This phenomenon, which the researchers refer to as “adultification bias,” was examined in a 2017 report from the same team. The latest report builds on those findings by including the lived experiences of black women and girls. It’s also worth noting that many of the women cited in the report recalled dealing with the same sorts of issues in their childhoods, showing that this is far from a new problem.

&gt; According to participants in the Georgetown study, which was released on Wednesday, **“when Black girls express strong or contrary views, adults view them as challenging authority or, more fundamentally, simply assume a girl’s character is just plain ‘bad.’”**

&gt; This bias also likely plays a role in the increasing use of discipline against black girls in the classroom, by law enforcement, and in interactions with authority figures, even though they are no more likely to misbehave than white girls.

&gt; In their first report on this issue in 2017, the Georgetown Law researchers found that **black girls as young as 5 years old are already seen as less innocent, and needing less support, than white girls of the same age. This presumption led teachers and other authority figures to treat black girls as older than they actually are and more harshly than white female students, with the disparity being particularly wide for 10- to 14-year-olds.**

&gt; In other cases, black girls are subjected to sexualization, with people accusing them of being “fast” or of trying to attract male attention with their clothes. The latter, which seems to align with the ways black women have historically been oversexualized and subjected to the “Jezebel” stereotype (a belief dating back to slavery that frames black women as hypersexual predators looking to corrupt men) has been linked to issues with school dress codes.

&gt; The **National Women’s Law Center noted in a 2018 report that black girls are more likely to be penalized for wearing the same things as other girls, and their bodies are often sexualized by teachers and school authority figures, who then punish them for minuscule or nonexistent clothing infractions.**

&gt; Taken together, these presumptions lead to black girls being held to a different standard, and facing punishments for not fitting a specific definition of quiet, reserved femininity. In so many ways, a woman in one of the focus groups observed, “we’re told to be smaller, quieter, lighter, prettier.”

&gt; **A 2012 report from the African American Policy Forum, for example, noted that when it comes to school discipline, black girls are often punished more severely in school because they are seen as more aggressive and less feminine than white girls.**

&gt; **Federal civil rights data has found that black girls are five to six times more likely to be suspended from their schools than white girls. Black girls are a relatively small percentage of the national student population but accounted for more than 40 percent of girls with multiple out-of-school suspensions in the 2011-’12 school year, according to the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights. In every state in the country, black girls are more likely to be suspended or referred to the juvenile justice system than their white peers.**

&gt; It’s also likely that the perception of black girls as older and less needing of protection plays a role in high-profile incidents involving police use of force against black girls, like when **a teenage girl was thrown in the classroom by a school resource officer in South Carolina in 2015**, or more recent incidents, like **an 11-year old girl being tasered by a police officer for allegedly shoplifting,** **a 14-year old black girl being struck and violently arrested by police in Coral Springs, Florida**, or an **incident this past January where four 12-year-old black and Latina girls were suspected of drug use and allegedly strip-searched in their New York school because they appeared “hyper and giddy.”**

322,fblzzix,"&gt;Just because you can throw 1.5 unrelated studies in does not make your argument in any way factual.

so far I only had one argument: that your original claim (the disparity in crime rates is due to poverty) wasn't true.

I didn't claim anything else so far. And I'm pretty sure you don't actually want to discuss it.

&gt;that doesn't mean that there's something inherently wrong with black/brown people

Agreed. Different people are just different. 

The problem is that the system is designed for white people (middle class and higher), and for people who are the same as them in every way except appearance.

If instead of Spain and Britain it had been Senegal and the Gold Coast who colonized the Americas, and if they were the ones who turned North America into the first democracy... then the US system would be significantly different, it would be adapted to the nature of people from that region of the world.

African Americans are exposed to a toxic cocktail of two subcultures:

- one that glorifies crime, violence, conspicuous consumption and selfish capitalist behavior.

- one that wallows in self-pity, glorifies victimhood, and incites resentment against whites as well as successful non-whites.

Liberal politics has

- destroyed the black nuclear family -- a huge percentage of black children are born to single mothers and grow up without a father, a situation strongly correlated with all kinds of bad life outcomes. 

- created multigenerational welfare dependence. And if it's not welfare, it's dependence on other types of handouts and structural advantages. This is how Democrats ensure that blacks keep voting for them.

- the way liberals want to run schools is awful. It's optimized for the learning experience of middle class white girls. Black boys (and to a lesser degree the other boys as well) need a stricter system, more like military school, more physical exercise as well. That's what the most successful private schools for black boys are like.

Then, of course, you have the echos of America's horrible history of discrimination and segregation, you have the psychological effects of lead-contaminated water, crack epidemic (partially caused by the government), and so on.

...

It's absurd to blame all these issues on genetic differences.  But differences do exist and they do matter."
323,fdf4hx4,"Cool, in a perfect world there would be no crimes, no injustice, no poverty, everyone would have a job. But in the real world bad things happen, people make poor decisions, and we should actually have some standards in declaring what's a crisis.

Also, let's be real, some goons out there are really doing dirt. Since you're playing the emotional appeal game I guess you would tell the family of that 6 year old girl who was shot, that someone caught in possession of a handgun should get ""just a warning"" if they're black? So we can even out the percentages of those committing crimes? Any innocents caught in gang activity in their neighbourhoods should just suck it up for the greater good?

Also just like the data doesn't show the demographics in the areas where crime is more rampant, it doesn't tell you which side the justice system is more biased too. It's possible that black boys are getting convicted properly based on evidence and white kids are more likely to get a pass or skate by on privledge for their charges. 

Both of those issues would require different solutions, but rather than getting specific on the details and actions our gov should take it's a lot easier to morally grandstand about what's right and wrong."
324,f7artnk,"So many studies, so little substance if you want to be on the topic of racism.

\&gt; ""We find converging evidence that Black boys are seen as older and less innocent and that they prompt a less essential conception of childhood than do their White same-age peers. Further, our findings demonstrate that the Black/ape association predicted actual racial disparities in police violence toward children.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Overall, African-American boys were more likely to enter puberty earlier than white or Hispanic boys. The earliest stage of puberty was found to occur at 9.14, 10.14 and 10.4 years in African-American, non-Hispanic whites and Hispanic boys, respectively. Researchers say they don’t know why these racial and ethnic differences exist.""

&amp;#x200B;

Black children mature earlier, no wonder they are seen as older and less innocent.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Across both studies, the researchers found that racial stereotypes shaped teachers’ responses not after the first infraction but rather after the second. Teachers felt more troubled by a second infraction they believed was committed by a black student rather than by a white student.

In fact, the stereotype of black students as “troublemakers” led teachers to want to discipline black students more harshly than white students after two infractions, Eberhardt and Okonofua said. They were more likely to see the misbehavior as part of a pattern, and to imagine themselves suspending that student in the future.""

&amp;#x200B;

There's a problem in saying this is racist. [https://www.educationnext.org/teacher-race-and-school-discipline-suspensions-research/](https://www.educationnext.org/teacher-race-and-school-discipline-suspensions-research/) This finds that yes, there seems to be a slight racial bias among teachers of all races (usually pro-same race), but Black teachers don't punish Black students significantly less so than White or other teachers, meaning that it's the behavior of Black kids that prompts punishment, not discrimination. Plus, Black kids have less fathers. That's a well known fact. It's much harder to teach discipline when you're a single parent, that's basically common knowledge. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; “Participants were 1022 White adults who volunteer and/or work with children in the United States who completed a cross-sectional, online survey. Results indicate high proportions of adults who work or volunteer with children endorsed negative stereotypes towards Blacks and other ethnic minorities. Respondents were most likely to endorse negative stereotypes towards Blacks, and least likely towards Asians (relative to Whites). Moreover, endorsement of negative stereotypes by race was moderated by target age. Stereotypes were often lower towards young children but higher towards teens.”

&amp;#x200B;

That doesn't mean anything. Stereotypes often arise because of behavior. So, since we know that Black kids behave the worst, they mature earlier and their wild hormones kick in earlier too, no wonder people automatically learn to assume things about them. That's how it works, nothing racial, because, as this source claims, Asians are least likely to be stereotyped. Asians are also least likely to... misbehave. This isn't coincidence, just another bit of proof of ""egalitarianism"" of stereotyping which is based in reality, not racial animosity or bias.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; “Engagement in particular behaviors had differential impact for African American vs. White students on the odds of receiving behavioral warnings, with African American students being less likely to be warned than their White peers. The current study demonstrates both the presence of disproportionality in non-exclusionary discipline as well as evidence that African American students experience escalated consequences (e.g., lower likelihood of receiving a warning) for infractions when they also engage in certain behaviors, even if those behaviors are not the direct cause for discipline.”

&amp;#x200B;

Doesn't really prove anything racist either. Here's a quote from the ""conclusion"" section of this study, which shows that you're quoting what you haven't read:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Although racial/ethnic disparities in exclusionary discipline havebeen a well-documented problem for decades, little has been known asto whether these disparities extended to non-exclusionary con-sequences, or whether the context of a student's general pattern ofbehavior would mitigate such disparities on an individual basis.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Black Students Face More Discipline, Data Suggests

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, because they behave worse.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; “Multivariate analyses, which enabled researchers to control for 83 different variables in isolating the effect of race alone on disciplinary actions, found that African-American students had a 31 percent higher likelihood of a school discretionary action, compared to otherwise identical white and Hispanic students.”

&amp;#x200B;

That's a useful study, but it doesn't acknowledge how puberty starts, or severity of actions of students.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Black students accounted for 15 percent of the student body in the 2015-2016 school year but 31 percent of arrests. Two years earlier, black students accounted for 16 percent of the student body and 27 percent of arrests. The data also show students with disabilities are far more likely to face suspension or arrests at school. They accounted for 12 percent of enrollment but 28 percent of all arrests and referrals to law enforcement.

A report from the Government Accountability Office released this month had similar findings, concluding that black students, boys and students with disabilities were overrepresented in disciplinary action: “These disparities were widespread and persisted regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school attended,” the GAO report said.""

&amp;#x200B;

Comparing rates without addressing possible explanations for divergent behavior? Eh, again, not proof of racism, just racial disparities.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Although there were negligible differences among the racial groups in how frequently boys committed crimes, white boys were less likely to spend time in a facility than black and Hispanic boys who said they'd committed crimes just as frequently, as shown in the chart above. A black boy who told pollsters he had committed just five crimes in the past year was as likely to have been placed in a facility as a white boy who said he'd committed 40.""

&amp;#x200B;

This only addresses statistics without looking at causes, again. No racism.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Black boys raised in America, even in the wealthiest families and living in some of the most well-to-do neighborhoods, still earn less in adulthood than white boys with similar backgrounds, according to a sweeping new study that traced the lives of millions of children.

White boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way. Black boys raised at the top, however, are more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households.""

“For poor children, the pattern is reversed. Most poor black boys will remain poor as adults. White boys raised in poor families fare far better.”

&amp;#x200B;

That doesn't account for spending patters, likelihood of committing a crime, job performance, or even school performance. Basically, useless study if you want to see if there's racism.

325,f932b2t,"No I think the reason black people in general aren't doing well is the toxic culture in many black communities. Where criminality is seen as virtuous and educational pursuits are denigrated. Where single motherhood is way too prevalent and black boys are not being taught to act as men. Where victimhood is seen as a virtue, being constantly told that the system is holding you down and that you are hated by white people is going to have some deep physcological effects. The welfare system also keeps people in a cycle of poverty that is hard to get out of and incentivizes single motherhood. There are many issues that the black community need to address from within before they expect to be able to benefit from any systemic change. We already have systems in place to help minorities: affirmative action, diversity hiring, grants, scholarships and loans just for minorities. Preferential treatment for entry into universities via lowering the standard for entry for black candidates. All of these things are put into place to help black communities due to past inequality and injustice but nothing is going to bring meaningful change until the culture and internal problems are addressed."
326,f08n3aj,"Black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women.

A large wage gap exists between the gap for white women and the gap affecting black women: This gap persists despite the fact that black women participate in the workforce at a higher rate than women of other races.  

A larger percentage of black women live below the poverty line today than in the 1970s.

Black pregnant workers are denied accommodations such as additional water breaks or access to light duty positions more often than women of other races.

There is a noted discipline disparity between how black girls are treated v. girls of other races in K-12.

With the advancement of AI and neural net applications, those algorithms can reinforce specific race &amp; gender bias in their applications.

Levels of violence against black women and girls are heightened.

Sex trafficking disproportionately affects black women and girls.

Black women are discriminated against in ways that often do not fit neatly within the legal categories of either “racism” *or* *“*sexism”—but as a combination of both racism *and* sexism.  

There are several employment discrimination-based lawsuits that illustrate how Black women’s complaints often fall between the cracks precisely because they are discriminated against *both* as women and as blacks.  The ruling in one such case, *DeGraffenreid v. General Motors*, filed by five Black women in 1976, demonstrates this point pretty well.

The General Motors Corporation had never hired a Black woman for its workforce before 1964—the year the Civil Rights Act passed through Congress.  All of the Black women hired after 1970 lost their jobs fairly quickly, however, in mass layoffs during the 1973–75 recession.  Such a sweeping loss of jobs among Black women led the plaintiffs to argue that seniority-based layoffs, guided by the principle “last hired-first fired,” discriminated against Black women workers at General Motors, extending past discriminatory practices by the company.

However, the court refused to allow the plaintiffs to combine sex-based and race-based discrimination into a single category of discrimination:

&gt;The plaintiffs allege that they are suing on behalf of black women, and that therefore this lawsuit attempts to combine two causes of action into a new special sub-category, namely, a combination of racial and sex-based discrimination…. The plaintiffs are clearly entitled to a remedy if they have been discriminated against. However, they should not be allowed to combine statutory remedies to create a new “super-remedy” which would give them relief beyond what the drafters of the relevant statutes intended. Thus, this lawsuit must be examined to see if it states a cause of action for race discrimination, sex discrimination, or alternatively either, but not a combination of both.5

In its decision, the court soundly rejected the creation of “a new classification of ‘black women’ who would have greater standing than, for example, a black male. The prospect of the creation of new classes of protected minorities, governed only by the mathematical principles of permutation and combination, clearly raises the prospect of opening the hackneyed Pandora’s box.”

This ruling that “providing legal relief only when Black women show that their claims are based on race or on sex is analogous to calling an ambulance for the victim only after the driver responsible for the injuries is identified.”

Hopefully these are some things you can think about."
327,f200a6i,"This is an interesting post. It’s unfortunate that young black boys feel the need to commit crimes so often but I don’t think it helps to say “I wish it had been white boys because they would be looked at differently” young boys in general shouldn’t feel inclined to commit crimes. Unfortunately, more young black boys are subject to poverty than white or Asian males. So it is important that we teach our young men to do more and want better for themselves. Instead of wishing bad behavior on others."

But I tracked down a report I came across a couple years ago that really sums it up. It's called Girlhood Interrupted: The Erasure of Black Girls' Childhood, put together by the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality. It summarizes findings that black girls are routinely viewed as adult much sooner than their white counterparts. From the report's executive summary: 

&gt;Compared to white girls of the same age, survey participants perceive that   
&gt;  
&gt;• Black girls need less nurturing   
&gt;  
&gt;• Black girls need less protection   
&gt;  
&gt;• Black girls need to be supported less   
&gt;  
&gt;• Black girls need to be comforted less   
&gt;  
&gt;• Black girls are more independent   
&gt;  
&gt;• Black girls know more about adult topics   
&gt;  
&gt;• Black girls know more about sex   
&gt;  
&gt;These results are profound, with far-reaching implications. Our findings reveal a potential contributing factor to the disproportionate rates of punitive treatment in the education and juvenile justice systems for Black girls.

Her ability to continually insist that she is still a GIRL AT AGE 27 is not just an annoying infantilization - it is accompanied with connotations that she deserves to be nurtured, protected, supported, and comforted because she is innocent and still learning how to navigate the world.

&gt;Black men earn significantly less than white men, even when they were raised in families making the same amount. Poor black boys tend to stay poor as adults, and wealthy black boys are more likely to be poor as adults than to stay wealthy.
“Black men raised in the top 1 percent — by millionaires — were as likely to be incarcerated as white men raised in households earning about $36,000,” explained a New York Times article, complete with graphics to let you follow different kids’ paths.   

https://www.epi.org/publication/poor-black-children-are-much-more-likely-to-attend-high-poverty-schools-than-poor-white-children/

&gt;As the chart shows, poor children are likely to end up in schools where a majority of their peers are also poor. For poor black children, the likelihood of attending a high-poverty school is even higher. While half of poor white students attend high-poverty schools, about eight in 10 poor black students attend schools with a high percentage of poor students. Since attending high poverty schools lowers math and reading achievement, the current system, which includes segregation by race/ethnicity and by socioeconomic status, shortchanges children attending these schools and challenges their future economic prospects and potential social mobility.

335,enntztc,"From the article

Research has already shown that black girls are seen by adults as less childlike than white girls. This phenomenon, known as “adultification,” was first documented two years ago by researchers at Georgetown Law’s Center on Poverty and Inequality. Now, a followup study reveals that, not surprisingly, black girls and women sharply feel the impact of “adultification.” As one study participant put it, “[T]o society, we’re not innocent. And white girls are always innocent.”

In an earlier 2017 study, Georgetown Law researchers found that black girls, even those as young as 5 years old, were seen by adults as less needing of comfort, nurturing, protection, and support than white girls. The researchers also found that black girls were perceived as more independent and knowledgeable about sex. In this latest study, researchers set out to understand how black girls and women experienced this “adultification” through a series of national focus groups.


 
They found a near-universal impact. “Almost all the black girls and women we talked to said they’d experienced adultification bias as children,” said co-author Jamilia Blake. “And they overwhelmingly agreed that it led teachers and other adults to treat them more harshly and hold them to higher standards than white girls.”"
336,ejwkexe,"A few things here. One, you are not the first person to suggest the Black Capitalism/Black conservatism approach. There are some problems with it, though. One, there isn't a 1:1 ratio of hard work to success. Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Sure one out of every x kid can ""make it out"" but not all of them. Meanwhile mediocre white kids can fuck around for a decade before deciding to get it together and still live that suburban life.   


And the for the Black kids  that don't grind and work hard, it's not all their fault. If a kid is transferred from shelter to shelter and their grades slip because they have no stability? Is that their fault.  


Also, yeah maybe you can work hard to try and build a better future, but escaping your class status won't immunize you from racism. And even then, the outcomes for black families aren't permanent. A few generations later, young black boys are still vulnerable to slipping back into poverty. Structural Racism has a lot to do with it."
337,ehczrzn,"&gt; And why do you suppose this is true? Is it because this police officer is racist? Or can there be another reason?

Yes, I do believe it is because statistically many people are racist, even on a subconscious level.

[‘Black’-sounding name conjures a larger, more dangerous person](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/5494/black-sounding-name-conjures-larger-more-dangerous-person)  
""Not only did participants envision the characters with black-sounding names as larger, even though the actual average height of black and white men in the United States is the same, but the researchers also found that size and status were linked in opposite ways depending on the assumed race of the characters. The larger the participants imagined the characters with “black”-sounding names, the lower they envisioned their financial success, social influence and respect in their community. Conversely, the larger they pictured those with “white”-sounding names, the greater they envisioned their status""

""A recognition memory task for the target’s face and six lures (skin tone variations of ±25%, ±37%, and ±50%) revealed that participants primed with “educated” exhibited more memory errors with respect to lighter lures—misidentifying even the lightest lure as the target more often than counterparts primed with “ignorant.”""

&gt;Baltimore is a bad example because it's a city with a huge black population living in poverty and a huge crime problem. Of course in such places, there will be a disproportionate use of force against black people. However, if you take a middle-class black neighborhood and a middle-class white neighborhood, I doubt you'd see the same pattern of excessive use of force against blacks by police.

From the Baltimore study:

""The high rate of stopping African Americans persists across the City, even in districts where African Americans make up a small share of the population. Indeed, the proportion of AfricanAmerican stops exceeds the share of African-American population in each of BPD’s nine police districts, despite significant variation in the districts’ racial, socioeconomic, and geographic composition."""

342,ebf6ysm,"The phenomena you highlighted could be caused by two factors:

1) For one, African Americans are portrayed as uneducated individuals largely living in horrid conditions and prone to criminality. This characterization, which in many cases is true, positions them having the lowest societal status. It is consequently no surprise that they would do very poorly with almost any other race that’s not black. They would likely do well with black girls because black girls are generally seen as the least attractive and consequently have no other options. 

2) Asian girls in my experience generally place a greater weight on status than even some white girls. And given the fact that blacks are generally perceived as having low status as a consequence of poverty and lack of education, it is no surprise that they would do horribly with girls from Asian cultures where education, achievement, and success are emphasized and extremely valued.

344,ecmy0y3,"Obviously wealth is going to play a huge factor in determining an individual’s success in life. This is extremely well documented.

All things held constant however, a white individual is still statistically more likely to succeed in the US than a non-white counterpart. This is due to things like implicit racism and differing expectations, as well as a whole host of societal factors. A lot of these things are easy to overlook, especially if they don’t directly affect you, but they play into some pretty damning overall trends. 

[Link: Black boys are the least likely of any group to escape poverty](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/04/03/black-boys-are-the-least-likely-of-any-group-to-escape-poverty) 

There’s been a whole host of studies looking into the different ways that white people implicitly favor white people over other races and specifically black people. In a majority white country, that’s kind of a big deal."
345,ecyaku3,"&gt; is used as much as 50 percent more frequently on children who are African American or who have disabilities

Yes, I dislike that sentence.  I'm a scientist, so language really matters to me.  That sentence would be true if all the kids facing discipline were white and had disabilities and also one black kid.  It doesn't paint a real picture of what's happening.

&gt; Black boys have the highest overall rate of school corporal punishment at 16%, followed by White boys at 9%. Black boys are 1.8 times as likely as White boys to be corporally punished,

Sure.  But this number by itself is usless.  What's the overall discipline rate for each group?   What's the parental education and income level?  If poverty is especially concentrated among African Americans (it certainly was in Florida) than a small 7% difference between the two groups isn't that big.  It only seems big when you instead report it as a ratio to inflate the effect.  16% vs 9% is much less eye-ball grabbing.

At 16% or 9% I'd worry more about the use of corporal punishment in general than a small difference based on race.  Especially since race and poverty are intertwined and affect so many other aspects of education.

For example when people say private schools have better students and outcomes, they neglect that private schools cherry pick their students, generally from better off families.  It's not suprising that they have fewer discipline issues.

So yeah, there's decent evidence here, and some of the districts in the study with like 500% discprancies surely have a racial component.  But the data you just showed here (16% vs 9%) could easily be explained by a larger number of issues that aren't discussed in the paper.  And if those are the cause, getting rid of racism does nothing.

If you eliminte racism and the kids are still in poverty, your best case scenario is getting 9% and 9% (assuming the difference is 100% race.) . I'd rather focus on getting all those numbers as close to zero as I can first."

348,e4ztfjq,"Thank you. Using the chart on page 68 of the study, taking the mean log household income in 1980, Asians score consistently higher than blacks within the same level of completed education. This puts them on a similar trend to whites, but actually above whites for every level completed except for grade 10. What do we take away from this? Well, if we also look at the following charts on page 73, highest grade attained for the 80's, Asians were ahead at Grade 13, where blacks were at grade 11. Higher level of education, higher average pay. Bear in mind that all of these are averages, and are weighted based on the distribution of age and sex within the black population. You can look at the information and infer racism, just as I can look at the information and infer that the Asians in those benchmarks were more likely to seek continued education, which is why I see that at a certain point, all those lines meet (Grade 17, all around the 10.6 marker). There is statistical evidence to suggest that those Asians will, in fact, continue their education, because of the statistic trend both historically and currently, that is demonstrating Asians attaining higher levels of education than blacks and whites.

Now, I'm gonna jump into the NYT article about how racism is to blame for the disparity between upward mobility for black men but not black women, somehow. Punishing reach of racism for black boys. According to the New York Times, black men suffer because of racism. This is the be all, end all of their article. They rebuke the assertion that the lack of upward mobility or shared trend between black and white males is due to historically lower testing scores, and even go so far as to admit that such a disparity is not present between white and black females, as we've already established. So, black men, even in families that experience low rates of poverty and provide good schools, tend to trend downward, while white men, do not nearly as much. However, black women experience extremely little disparity to their white counterparts. So far I am seeing a sharp difference between black men and black women. The article has, to its credit, stripped all external variables that would commonly be suggestive of statistical influence. All factors being the same, or otherwise removed, black men trend downwards as black women do not.

Let me ask you this: If black men and black women are both black, then why is racism the answer? It seems to me that both genders of a specific race, experiencing very different outcomes of income, are separated not by their shared race, but by their gender. They are all black, half of them are male, half are female. Of those two distinct groups, one is experiencing economic downturn, while the other is not. One is experiencing lower average income than their white counterparts, one is not. How can this be attributed to racism?

Continue reading: Income gaps between whites and Hispanics are converging, and will disappear within a few generations, should mobility remain consistent. Asians are already making more than their white counterparts. This holds true for males and females of the aforementioned groups. So America is racist, but only against black boys, not black females, and not Hispanics and not Asians, at least in terms of economic outcomes. The racism just suddenly cuts off there, in terms of quantifiable results. Sure, they may experience discrimination, they may experience race based hate, but name a race in America that is immune to it on an individual basis. There exist people that will say one can not be racist against whites. These people are morons. There exist people that will say racism in America does not exist anymore. These people are morons. But to suggest that this deeply embedded racism is the reason black boys are not succeeding, while black girls are, kind of contradicts the notion that racism is to blame.

I'll continue: There is a great difficulty in finding a neighborhood in which few fathers are present in which black or white boys succeeded, and the ones where both black and white boys did succeed happened to have a high presence of father figures. Even if the family was without a father figure, neighborhood role models were present. That's good to know, even if it is qualified with this scenario being extremely rare, and typically the opposite case where few fathers were present (and in which both black boys and white boys failed to reach success).

Let's keep going. Black families tend to marry at significantly lower rates than white families, meaning a higher number of single income households skewing results.

I guess the big question I have for you is: Are black men experiencing this disparity because of racism, where black women are not (black women who experience racism and sexism, according to the article), or because of behavior?"
349,e69yvmb,"&gt;The effect is stronger on boys. Research has found that boys, and particularly black boys, are more affected than girls by disadvantages, like poverty and racism, and by positive influences, like high-quality schools and role models. Yet they are least likely to have had a teacher that looks like them.

I think that this segment in the article is perhaps the most important, and I really appreciate that NYT didn't just leave these statements unsupported, but linked to further reading.  I really don't have much to add, but I can't re-emphasize enough how important it is that boys, *especially* black and Hispanic boys, have educators that can not only sympathize with their experience, but share it. It's so sad how this problem has such a nasty self-reinforcing element to it."
350,e4a7ene,"I recall a bunch of times hearing in the news that a black girl was told that her hair is not allowed or violates dress code.  [a lot of the ones here](https://www.elitedaily.com/life/culture/black-girls-natural-hair-racism-schools/1953497) are not north american examples, though I think three of them are. The issue is that as long as black girls are still getting told to change their hair for school, called untidy for their hair, not to mention being bullied for it by peers, a white person with a black hairstyle is appropriating culture. The reactions that white vs black women get are very different. It's like how throughout history black women were discriminated against for having big lips and bigger butts, but it becomes a trendy+cool once kylie jenner botoxes those same features onto herself. 

So I guess what I'm saying is it's not necessarily about the style itself but more a general racism thing. Like if that hair did become more accepted the way you are suggesting, by normalizing it by making it more common, it hasn't solved the root of the issue (racism). This is why I think the best way to make it more accepted is to have more black women in the same positions of power and economic status that white women are (speaking on average) so that there are more black women in entertainment, business, academia etc and that way black female features will become more accepted. Making it socially acceptable for white women to have hair/lips/tans that imitate black features is kind of just picking and choosing aspects of a culture/phsyical features from a community, while leaving said community in poverty/incarcerated/stuck at home cos they couldn't access birth control or abortion options. Whoo that was a wall of text but I hope that made sense. "
351,e63rwb4,"&gt;This implies that teachers of colour would be consequently less able to identify gifted white students.

Nope. Black teachers produce statistically indistinguishable outcomes for White students when compared to White teachers. 


Highlights: 
&gt;The effect is stronger on boys. Research has found that boys, and particularly black boys, are more affected than girls by disadvantages, like poverty and racism, and by positive influences, like high-quality schools and role models. Yet they are least likely to have had a teacher that looks like them.

&gt;“We find that the effect is really driven by boys,” said Seth Gershenson, an economist studying education policy at American University. “In the elementary school setting, for black children and especially disadvantaged black children, the effect of having even just one black teacher is fairly big and robust and a real thing.”

&gt;When black children had a black teacher between third and fifth grades, boys were significantly less likely to later drop out of high school, and both boys and girls were more likely to attend college, Mr. Gershenson and his colleagues found in a large study last year. The effect was strongest for children from low-income families. The study included 106,000 students who entered third grade in North Carolina from 2001 to 2005, and it followed them through high school. There was no effect on white children when they had a black teacher.

Just to add emphasis: 

&gt;There was no effect on white children when they had a black teacher.

Essentially, Black teachers equal their white peers in reaching white children, but provide superior service to Black students when compared to white teachers.

358,dvipdfm,"...or is it likely poverty, family, and support structures instead, which have far stronger correlations than a racial component?

A black boy in a rich family is inherently better off than a white boy in a poor family. The issue is more black boys are born in poverty and out of wedlock, which happened because their parents were born the same way. See? "
359,dw2fx09,"The last bit says 2/3rds of black boys are raised in poverty but MORE THAN HALF of white boys are raised rich or upper middle class.

Call me a skeptic, but I really have my doubts about this. I'd say easily more than half of the white people I've met in my life do not have much money. What are we calling ""rich"" or ""upper middle class?"" and I get the black community struggles, but 2/3rds in poverty? I really don't know about that. Black people I run into are about as well-to-do as the white people I know if I'm honest. "
360,dru0blv,"Little black girls are more likely to be in underfunded schools and areas that have a shortage of mental healthcare.

There’s a [study ](http://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/centers-institutes/poverty-inequality/upload/girlhood-interrupted.pdf) that young black girls are more likely to be sexualized and objectified than their white counterparts. These girls (from the age of 5) are not viewed from the same lens of innocence. That’s fucked up"
362,dt6aytz,"[According to data released today by the Department of Education, black students are expelled at three times the rate of white students. This extends all the way down to the youngest kids; as the New York Timesreports, “While black children make up 18 percent of preschool enrollment, close to half of all preschool children who are suspended more than once are African-American.”](https://www.thedailybeast.com/are-black-students-unruly-or-is-america-just-racist)

This is just another reminder that blacks face a huge disparity in school discipline. In 2012, for instance the Department of Education found that blacks accounted for 35 percent of students suspended at least once, and 39 percent of all expulsions. This, despite the fact that African Americans are just 18 percent of the total student population.

And of course, there are particular places where the rates of suspension and expulsion are insane. **Of the students suspended under zero tolerance policies in New Orleans in 2009, for instance, all of them were black.**

 Compared to their white counterparts, black boys are three times more likely to be placed in remedial or “problem” classes, as opposed to receiving counseling or a diagnosis. School-related arrests are depressingly common, and in 70 percent of cases, they involve black or Latino students. The same goes for referrals to law enforcement—in one Mississippi school district, for example, 33 out of every 1,000 students have been arrested or referred to a juvenile detention center, the vast majority of whom were black.

You might be inclined to see this as evidence of bad behavior by African American students. But there’s no evidence that African Americans are worst behaved than their white counterparts. Indeed, notes Al Jazeera America, “the disparity in punishment can’t be explained by more frequent or serious infractions by minority students.” To wit, according to the available evidence, the vast majority of suspensions are for minor infractions, like lateness or violation of the dress code. Which is to say that this isn’t about black student’s behavior—it’s about racism.

http://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/disproportionate-minority-contact-in-the-juvenile-justice-system/

But school discipline policies are moving in the opposite direction: out-of-school suspensions have increased about 10 percent since 2000. They have more than doubled since the 1970s. Black students are three times more likely to be suspended or expelled than white students

This happens way more at schools with officers. A report by the Justice Policy Institute found that, even controlling for a school district's poverty level, schools with officers had five times as many arrests for ""disorderly conduct"" as schools without them.

This isn't something that the juvenile court system is calling for — quite the opposite. The chief judge of the juvenile court in Clayton County, Georgia has become an outspoken opponent of police in schools and the school-to-prison pipeline after placing cops on school grounds resulted in eleven times as many students getting sent to juvenile court.

363,do5sg3e,"Even if we operate on the assumption the victim is white, I still do not see how that is pertinent to this specific case. Sex-based oppression is obvious, and it's very likely that poverty (class-based oppression) is a factor, but there are no mentions of racial motivation. Poor people of any race in most areas are more likely to be religious (for a number of reasons) but the coercion she is facing there stems from a patriarchal theology rather than her race. A (Gallup poll)[http://news.gallup.com/poll/162548/americans-misjudge-abortion-views.aspx] from 2013 suggests nonwhite Americans are more likely than white Americans to be anti-abortion.

I don't understand why you sarcastically use ""white-woman's privilege"" in the first comment when you could more accurately use ""poor women's privilege"" or ""American women's privilege."" Being a woman (or cis woman as trans activists say) is not a privilege because we are targeted for having female anatomy. Being white does not erase sex-based oppression, but black women have to face problems from systemic racism that white women do not have to face. Black girls are far more likely to be suspended or expelled from school than white girls, for example. Black rape victims are less likely than white rape victims to be believed. If we want to discuss race in feminist issues, we need to be candid and honest about the situation and the structures that enable it, especially as radical feminists."

Then add on the fact that Black American youth are not treated as children and are more severely punished and assumed to be guilty. When they become adults they can't get loans and aren't hired. 

Many turn to crime as either a means of making a living or just to cope with drugs (not saying that is right, just explaining what often happens). Finally, they are more severely punished for those mistakes than their white counterparts. "

A garbage public education system, based on systematic racism of low expectations, that doesn't encourage black students to excel. Creating a culture that doesn't value education. Very limited options for black inner city parents to get kids into better quality schools. 

The outsourcing of good paying blue collar jobs for lower skilled workers has economically decimated inner city communities. Forcing people into low paying McJobs and welfare, perpetuating a never ending cycle of poverty. 

A corporately driven black media culture that glorifies gang violence, poor values, and a lack of personal responsibility. 

A persistent myth, perpetuated by leftists, that systematic racism will always prevent blacks from succeeding. Which has convinced far too many blacks that there's no point in even trying, leading many to abandon their dreams. These same leftists demonize successful blacks as ""Uncle Toms"", perpetuating the myth that blacks cannot possibly succeed on their own merits and therefore must be selling out to whitey.  

A lack of fatherhood. Black men refusing to take responsibility for their kids. Black boys are thus being forced to grow up in households without strong male figures acting as caregivers and role models. Boys crave attention from strong men to teach them how to be men.

There's a lot of racism in the dance world that is perpetuated on a systemic level. 

  Some parents would pull their children out of these situations and some parents wouldn't because the reality is that POC can't escape every racist situation. I don't think either answer is necessarily wrong. It's up to the parent. People in this sub really like to fault Holly on this point, but it's sooo difficult as a black parent to make these kinds of decisions. Do you shield your black child from racism entirely and not allow them to grow a thick enough skin to prepare them for the ugly world ahead of them? Or do you allow your child to follow their dream and  teach them how to navigate the racism they will face?  It's hard to say what's the right or wrong answer. Im sure there are so many conversations that Holly had with Nia about racism behind the scenes that we didn't see which is probably why Nia is so well adjusted.  I think Holly's decision would have been different if Nia wasn't very passionate about dancing and wanted to do it as only a hobby, as opposed to a career 

That being said, I think Nia (and all the girls) could have benefitted under someone else's instruction. I'm not a dancer but I've heard that a lot of the girls have poor technique and the choreography is repetitive and not challenging.

)? Here's a snippet:

&gt;Parents, community members, students, and educators alike agreed that streaming continues to be an issue for Black students throughout the GTA, with Black students feeling encouraged and in some cases actually pressured by teachers and guidance counsellors to take Applied rather than Academic courses. Throughout the consultations, participants shared stories of students who had a B average in Grade 8 and were told that they ""could get As if they took Applied courses in high school."" Some students with an A average in Grade 8 were told that high school would be ""much harder"" if they took Academic courses, and on that basis they ""were encouraged to take Applied courses to maintain their A average."" Still other students were told that there was no point in taking Academic courses because they ""are not cut out for post-secondary education."" In other cases, when meeting with guidance counsellors for their Grade 9 course selection, students reported that, without any prior knowledge of them and without even reviewing their academic record, the guidance counsellor assumed they would be enrolling in Applied courses. Some students even reported that although they had selected Academic courses on which their parents had signed-off, educators nevertheless enrolled them in Applied courses.

&gt;For students with ambitions of going on to university, the implications of taking Applied courses, regardless of grades, was sometimes not explained by the guidance counsellor. Some students reported they were surprised to find out in their final year of high school that theycould not apply to university because they were in the Applied program of study

&gt;A number of the Black students who participated in our sessions claimed that while their White peers were encouraged to take Academic courses and were ""supported to do well"" even as they struggled in the Academic courses, Black students were not given similar support and encouragement. One social worker who participated in a session in one of the suburban regions concurred with the viewpoint of these students:

&gt; &gt; *As a social worker, during student success meetings, I am infuriated at how often the guidance counselor suggested changing pathways for Black and visible minority students whenever they are not receiving a passing grade. This is not suggested as often for White students. Over and over again, I notice how a White student’s poor grades are explained away based on mental health issues, family circumstances, and other concerns. The assumption is that their grades will improve and there will be no need for them to move down to the Applied level. However, Black students who struggle must be ‘placed in the proper track for their academic potential.’*

&gt;And as one White educator, who teaches Applied courses, added:

&gt; &gt; *I routinely see Black students in my classes who should be in Academic. I never see students from other races in Applied who should not be there.*

&gt;Participants noted that the allocation of funds to schools with a large Black student population reinforced the streaming of Black students into Applied courses. They contended that schools in low-income neighbourhoods with a significant population of racialized and predominantly Black residents were not set up to support these students to take Academic courses and to go on to university. In the words of one student:

&gt; &gt;*I went to a school that had a great kitchen and trades classrooms. They are decked out with all the newest equipment and tools. But in the academic classes, like law, we had to share textbooks.*

&gt;Accordingly, students who wished to attend university were required to attend a school outside of their neighbourhood where they would be able to take Academic courses and have more course options. It was felt that children in low-income neighbourhoods, where limited resources and poverty were part of their reality, start with disadvantages that are made worse by a school system that does not help them overcome these disadvantages.

&gt;It was reasoned that given the low expectations that elementary and middle school teachers have of their Black students, which are premised on the notion that they were not academically inclined, many Black students tended to be emotionally and academically unprepared for Academic courses when they entered high school. As one teacher in a Toronto consultation stated:

&gt; &gt; *These students are so damaged by the time they get to high school; they believe they can only take Applied courses.*

&gt; Another teacher from a region outside of Toronto echoed this sentiment:

&gt; &gt; *The over-representation in Applied is a manifestation of their conditioning.*

&gt; The tendency for school staff to focus on the athletic prowess and aptitude of Black students was also identified as a means by which the academic success of Black students is undermined. Participants shared stories of Black students being recruited to ensure success of the school's sports teams. These Black youth then were seen primarily as having solely athletic contributions to the school, to the detriment of genuine care and attention for their academic success. While these students were lauded for their athletic skills, competencies, and achievements, their academic abilities and educational potential were not similarly supported. Many participants noted that the Black students who played on their school's sports teams were allowed to continue playing sports even while having poor grades or not attending classes. As some participants noted:

&gt; &gt; *There are two ways Black students are treated. High performing athletes get attention. The rest are ignored.*

&gt; &gt; *Black boys are encouraged to excel in athletics—at the expense of academics.*

&gt; &gt; *Black students like sports because when they are in sports they get positive reinforcement. They don’t get this in the classroom.*

&gt; &gt; *Teachers need to know that Black students are not thugs or just people who are good at sports.*

&gt; Young people in the consultation sessions talked of the important role their parents played in helping them resist educators' suggestions that they take Applied courses. Those who were successful in resisting and are now in university credit their own active and consistent resistance to being steered into Applied courses and/or the persistent advocacy of their parents with their educational achievements. The following comments reveal their experiences while in high school:

&gt; &gt; *I was forced to fight with the guidance counsellor to stay in the academic program.*

&gt; &gt; *The guidance counsellor was pushing me into Applied classes. She asked me to drop all my STEM courses. I had to stop going to the guidance counsellor and went to the VP to choose courses.*

&gt;But other students who were stuck in the Applied programs into which they were placed contended that in many cases their parents did not always understand the different programs of study and the impact that course selection would have on their opportunities to pursue post-secondary education. As such, many felt that their parents were not equipped to advocate for them and to ensure they were enrolled in courses that reflected their abilities and supported their interest in pursuing post-secondary education."

In other cases, when meeting with guidance counsellors for their Grade 9 course selection, students reported that, without any prior knowledge of them and without even reviewing their academic record, the guidance counsellor assumed they would be enrolling in Applied courses. Some students even reported that although they had selected Academic courses on which their parents had signed-off, educators nevertheless enrolled them in Applied courses.

&gt;For students with ambitions of going on to university, the implications of taking Applied courses, regardless of grades, was sometimes not explained by the guidance counsellor. Some students reported they were surprised to find out in their final year of high school that theycould not apply to university because they were in the Applied program of study

&gt;A number of the Black students who participated in our sessions claimed that while their White peers were encouraged to take Academic courses and were ""supported to do well"" even as they struggled in the Academic courses, Black students were not given similar support and encouragement. One social worker who participated in a session in one of the suburban regions concurred with the viewpoint of these students:

&gt; &gt; *As a social worker, during student success meetings, I am infuriated at how often the guidance counselor suggested changing pathways for Black and visible minority students whenever they are not receiving a passing grade. This is not suggested as often for White students. Over and over again, I notice how a White student’s poor grades are explained away based on mental health issues, family circumstances, and other concerns. The assumption is that their grades will improve and there will be no need for them to move down to the Applied level. However, Black students who struggle must be ‘placed in the proper track for their academic potential.’*

&gt;And as one White educator, who teaches Applied courses, added:

&gt; &gt; *I routinely see Black students in my classes who should be in Academic. I never see students from other races in Applied who should not be there.*

&gt;Participants noted that the allocation of funds to schools with a large Black student population reinforced the streaming of Black students into Applied courses. They contended that schools in low-income neighbourhoods with a significant population of racialized and predominantly Black residents were not set up to support these students to take Academic courses and to go on to university. In the words of one student:

&gt; &gt;*I went to a school that had a great kitchen and trades classrooms. They are decked out with all the newest equipment and tools. But in the academic classes, like law, we had to share textbooks.*

&gt;Accordingly, students who wished to attend university were required to attend a school outside of their neighbourhood where they would be able to take Academic courses and have more course options. It was felt that children in low-income neighbourhoods, where limited resources and poverty were part of their reality, start with disadvantages that are made worse by a school system that does not help them overcome these disadvantages.

&gt;It was reasoned that given the low expectations that elementary and middle school teachers have of their Black students, which are premised on the notion that they were not academically inclined, many Black students tended to be emotionally and academically unprepared for Academic courses when they entered high school. As one teacher in a Toronto consultation stated:

&gt; &gt; *These students are so damaged by the time they get to high school; they believe they can only take Applied courses.*

&gt; Another teacher from a region outside of Toronto echoed this sentiment:

&gt; &gt; *The over-representation in Applied is a manifestation of their conditioning.*

&gt; The tendency for school staff to focus on the athletic prowess and aptitude of Black students was also identified as a means by which the academic success of Black students is undermined. Participants shared stories of Black students being recruited to ensure success of the school's sports teams. These Black youth then were seen primarily as having solely athletic contributions to the school, to the detriment of genuine care and attention for their academic success. While these students were lauded for their athletic skills, competencies, and achievements, their academic abilities and educational potential were not similarly supported. Many participants noted that the Black students who played on their school's sports teams were allowed to continue playing sports even while having poor grades or not attending classes. As some participants noted:

&gt; &gt; *There are two ways Black students are treated. High performing athletes get attention. The rest are ignored.*

&gt; &gt; *Black boys are encouraged to excel in athletics—at the expense of academics.*

&gt; &gt; *Black students like sports because when they are in sports they get positive reinforcement. They don’t get this in the classroom.*

&gt; &gt; *Teachers need to know that Black students are not thugs or just people who are good at sports.*

&gt; Young people in the consultation sessions talked of the important role their parents played in helping them resist educators' suggestions that they take Applied courses. Those who were successful in resisting and are now in university credit their own active and consistent resistance to being steered into Applied courses and/or the persistent advocacy of their parents with their educational achievements. The following comments reveal their experiences while in high school:

&gt; &gt; *I was forced to fight with the guidance counsellor to stay in the academic program.*

&gt; &gt; *The guidance counsellor was pushing me into Applied classes. She asked me to drop all my STEM courses. I had to stop going to the guidance counsellor and went to the VP to choose courses.*

&gt;But other students who were stuck in the Applied programs into which they were placed contended that in many cases their parents did not always understand the different programs of study and the impact that course selection would have on their opportunities to pursue post-secondary education. As such, many felt that their parents were not equipped to advocate for them and to ensure they were enrolled in courses that reflected their abilities and supported their interest in pursuing post-secondary education."

382,fvx8sce,"I almost forgot having an opinion was illegal.

A lot of you seem to be struggling with reading comprehension. This is an opinion. Not everyone is attracted to ""ghetto black girls with a weave."" Is he criticizing black girls with a weave, shaming them, anything... no. He made it very clear that this is his personal opinion. He even went as far the second sentence to explain that he wasn't trying to generalize about all black people.

I guess most of the r/FragileWhiteRedditor is used to being part of the hivemind and being told what to think and how to act. Perhaps that is why they are unable to comprehend the possibility of someone having a differing opinion. This isn't an opinion that black girls are ugly or that white people are bad (lol), it's literally an opinion over preferences in a partner, which EVERYONE has. But oh, it doesn't equate to ""black people good white people bad ACAB"" so time to hivemind yay.

You guys tried to act tough and said you wanted to ""take the piss out of the pigs."" Here's your chance. Anyone who downvotes but doesn't respond is **chicken** and admits they are sheeple."
383,fvzd75r,"Yeah im not saying that you camt be racist if you dont date people of color, like if your reaction is "" black girls are so fucking ugly"" thats racist. But just not asking out black women or respectfully declining them if they ask you out is not bigotry.  There's a big difference between  ""NO THATS DISGUSTING ID NEVER DATE A BLACK WOMAN GROSS!!"" And ""Thank you, but no, im not interested"". Not finding someone sexually attractive does not inherently mean you hold any malice or ill will in your heart towards them. This is not the same at all but its the closest i can use as an example because i don't personally have race preferences and  comparing height oppression to racial oppression would be stupid but just as an example- i dont like short guys.  Im not attracted to guys that are my height or shorter 
.it doesnt mean i hate them, i dont even think theyre objectively ugly and i definitely definitely want them to have all of the happiness and rights and success and love i wish for myself.  But NONE of that includes rights to my body or a right to a relationship with me. That doesn't make you a hateful person.  What makes you hateful is how you express your preferences and whether or not you let not wanting to fuck someone affect whether or not you treat that person with respect. There's an unsettling amount of people with an attitude of ""i dont find this person fuckable, they shouldn't be allowed to show themselves in public in case I see them"" or commenting on photos of women they dont find attractive and basically acting like the fact that they saw a woman they dont wanna fuck is an attack on them"
384,fw05ud5,"No one here is trying to guilt anyone (except for the guy in the photo but literally everyone here agrees that he's a dumbass). What we're (or at least I'm) trying to say is that sometimes, not being attracted to black people or people of colour in general stems from unconscious biases and prejudices. I know it did for me. The example you gave of someone saying ""black girls are ugly"" is obviously on a whole other level but people who have prejudices against black people don't necessarily know that they have them - I certainly didn't as I explained in another comment.

Basically, I'm not going to judge someone for who they choose to date and neither is anyone else here but I do think it's important to question your beliefs/preferences/whatever and think about if those preferences really are just that or if there's an unconscious bias there. And I mean really think about it because it's hard."

Like one I hear a lot is black girls are ugly, loud and they say they’d never date one. Now I understand preferences but they just think black people are genuinely ugly across the board. Idk I just think even if you have a preference, if you don’t find at least one black females attractive when you can find one girl from every other race that you objectively say is attractive there’s obvious prejudice there. There’s also the subtly of the Oreo comment which is basically what you’re talking about when they call you white.

I know I'm not imagining the black girls I know and their boyfriends or the guys that approach them. If they're doing well, other black girls are doing moderately well, other black girls are doing decently and other black girls aren't doing so great. I can take my experience, my many rejections, my existence in both the city and an all white town, black girls calling each other attractive and never me....and conclude that I am ugly.

I'm not looking to live the life of a white Stacey and nothing suggests that she is either. She can *improve* her chances by moving and knowing how small towns are in regards to race (yeah,London is no utopia but you're never alone) she'll be better off.

I'm frankly bored of this idea that every single black woman is sitting at home, alone and seen as ugly. I know we're not *the* beauty standard but it doesn't mean that black women do not date, do not date casually and never have fulfilling romantic lives. Our experience might be made harder by race but it is not the be all and end all nor does it define the experience of average to attractive black women."

Like am I ugly cuz I’m ugly or ugly cuz I’m average and black??? I don’t know what the true standard of beauty is for black people cuz I’ve only ever had white standards to look to.

From movies, tv shows, social media, and real life people I’ve come to understand that an average looking white girl can be heralded as beautiful &amp; desirable despite being average looking. However, the average black girl is NEVER. Average black girls are still considered ugly or non-desirable. We have to be HOT or over sexualized for our beauty to be noticed and praised.

Average White girls get their looks hyped all the time whether it’s fictional Bella from Twilight or influencers like Emma Chamberlain or Charlie Dimalio.

I used to love following pages that showed beautiful dark skinned women, but not so much anymore. They never post pretty-average black girls who had uncurvy bodies, didn’t slick their hair perfectly, whose skin didn’t constantly glow, whose ass wasn’t fat. 

The same goes for other people of color too! Like the average Desi girl is so pretty, but no one talks about it. The conversation surrounding average black women needs to be had first tho cuz We been constantly have our looks and fashion blatantly appropriated and shamed."

That but about your entire race. These girls have no stake in black beauty, they dont get to partake in something they beat others down for. Its hypocrisy. Its racism and its ingrained deep. People refusing to call it what it is perpetuates that problem. It's being told that black girls are ugly, that they aren't as smart, that they're lesser, essentially not only are women like this being hypocrites, they're subconsciously saying they're ""better"" at being black than we are.

402,fo29qiu,"Honestly I’m sad to say but I feel the same way. I’ve experienced colorism myself and I’ve also seen colorists in action. I consider myself brown skinned but as a brown skin girl my skin tone varies depending on the season. I noticed I get the most compliments in winter, when I’m at my lightest despite the fact that my skin can get really dry in the winter. But yes in the winter I get majority of the male attention. In the summer however, when I’m at my darkest I’m generally ignored by most guys and I get insults and nasty looks. I moved last year from a majority black school to a pretty mixed school and this is pretty much the first time I myself have experienced colorism. When I was at the predominantly black school, I was considered one of the prettiest girls at school. There was also a lot of other brown skin and dark skin girls who were considered the prettiest in the school. Since there was a big population of brown skin and dark skin girls, there was no room for the ignorance of colorism. But at my newer school, it was a totally different environment. Many of the black boys in my school make it known their “preference” is white,mixed , Asian, etc. Everything except black. I also noticed that pretty much the only black guys who like black girls are the ones from the hood. An environment where there’s plenty of brown/darkskin girls. I’m 15 now and I have dated a couple colorist guys already. A guy I really liked(black basketball player), told me that he liked me but would never date a black girl. The very next week he was with a white girl and at the same time still tried to lead me on. My next boyfriend only preferred black girls but made it clear darkskin girls are ugly and would never be an option. When I responded that I’m darkskin at times, he got upset and said I’m too pretty and therefore can’t be dark skin. As a girl who already struggled with my self esteem(especially my body image), dealing with colorism and the stereotypes that are associated with the beliefs of it, really took a toll on me. It really hurt to realize that the same guys that I felt most comfortable with as far as relationships and beauty standards could be just as sickening as the people outside of my community I was uncomfortable with. I’m mostly attracted to black guys but because of how so many of them view girls like me I’m hesitant to ever pursue them. And even if I do, I’m worried a relationship with a black guy won’t go anywhere far due to any preexisting beliefs he could possibly have about girls like me."

406,fp9uvul,"Hi I would definitely ask that you have a deeper conversation with him about this revelation. It’s important to know if this is just a simple dating preference or if he actually has biased or stereotypical views about black women (and even other black people in general) and asians as well.

I know you didn’t want to share his reasons for his dating preference against black women but if he says things like “all black girls are ghetto and ugly” these are red flags and you would know he holds hurtful stereotypes in his heart.  If he himself has striking black features (dark skin, super curly/ afro-like hair, wide nose, large lips, etc.) and those are the exact features he doesn’t like about black women he might have self esteem issues you can encourage him to work on trying to love himself more!

But more importantly you should definitely make sure you’re not dating someone that is ignorant or has a fetish for asian women.  If he says some version of “black girls are too loud and aggressive and I only like submissive asians” that’s definitely a red flag for you.  He believes is stereotypes that are untrue, and could be expecting you to act in the way he thinks an asian “should” act and sees value in you because of those made up characteristics.  So you could ask what lead to his dating preference to only seek out asians.  

Lastly, I would try to respectfully dig deeper into what happened to him as a child and find out how that has shaped his core beliefs as an adult.  Good luck and I hope he opens up to you more!"

You get the “I’m not usually into black girls but you’re hot,” etc kind of vibes or even explicit comments from non-black men. Meaning, “I’m conditioned to find black women unattractive but for some reason I’m really attracted to you.” Additionally, black men who only go after white women are typically self hating, and are only a subset.

""I posted 4 times about your video, each post explaining a different, embarrassing aspect of the person's reasoning. If you can't parse simple sentences, I can't break it down any more than that.""

What you posted was a snarky and uneducated interpretation of the data and what it represented due to your incessant need to vilify any piece of evidence that does not fit your narrative. But you know what? Let's go through this regardless:

 ""Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhahahahahahahahahahaha you reply to a 4 month old post with a video and the very first point the guy brings up in defence of 'black sounding names' is that 'WELL THEY'RE ONLY DISCRIMINATING AGAINST POOR-AND-LOW-EDUCATION-SOUNDING BLACK NAMES!' lol. This is gold. I will watch the rest of it though and laugh at it.""

So here he is describing how certain black sounding names have more of an effect on whether or not they would be more likely to be hired for a job, and how it defers from other black sounding names. You could say that these names are ""Ghetto"" for the former and not so for the latter. So the argument being made here is that yes, certain ""Ghetto"" sounding black names are more likely to be discriminated against than other black names. Racism right? Well if you take into consideration the fact that the resume is the only thing that these employers have to go off of initially, the analysis that they make based on the statistical probability of crime from black people in ghetto neighborhoods with these ghetto names, the argument is that socio-economic perception rather than racism is the culprit for this type of discrimination, rather than just being that the name is black exclusively. That is NOT the same as racism. Here is an analogy: You walk down the street at night and see a shadowy figure, what do you do? Like most normal people you cross the street by making a judgment at that moment based on the context of what you know and the risk. Say that person happened to turn out to be black. Is that racist? NO, because your decision was based off probability of a group, i.e shadowy figures and the likelihood that they would attack you at night. Same applies here, these employers go based on the information on hand and what they know to be on average more probable of a certain group. This does not make it right by any means, but the people who look at these studies and jump to ""MuH rAcIsM"" are no closer to solving the issue.

 ""Are you seriously, seriously submitting this video as evidence? The very next citation he makes on the 'updated analysis of race and gender' gave the applicants 'black surnames' instead like - and get this - Jefferson and Washington. Also, that's not a peer reviewed article. I wonder why.""

Well, yeah the majority of black people have those surnames. They also purposefully chose first names without socio-economic implications to see if there would still be a disparity, and if there were that would safely prove that racism is at play, however that wasn't the case. They even acknowledge how there could be a problem with the first names chosen in so far as they may not have been perceived as black enough. However when accounting for that margin of error the disparity is still statistically zero. Here, i'll link it for you just in case you missed it:  [https://economics.missouri.edu/working-papers/2014/wp1419\_koedel.pdf](https://economics.missouri.edu/working-papers/2014/wp1419_koedel.pdf) As for the article not being ""Peer reviewed"", it is utterly astonishing the way you dismiss this article with this nonsense. ""Peer review"" is superbly flawed in many ways, read up on it why don't you:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1420798/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1420798/)[https://www.npr.org/2015/08/21/433192324/peer-review-feedback-the-good-the-bad-the-really-ugly](https://www.npr.org/2015/08/21/433192324/peer-review-feedback-the-good-the-bad-the-really-ugly)  I'm not saying that the article does not have any flaws,   I'm saying that something that has yet to be ""peer reviewed"" does not mean that it is wrong or the research is invalid, and conversely, something that is peer reviewed does not make it correct or valid. 

 ""Holy shit. Holy shit. I can't believe you gave me this gold mine 4 months after the fact. He ~~criticises~~  criticizes her for **accurately representing the data by saying 'black boys' instead of 'black people'** and somehow trying to use this to show there is no element of race in the findings? It's like I'm watching a moron trying to force evidence to fit his narrative. Wait. I *am* watching a moron trying to force evidence to fit his narrative.""

Are you an idiot? How is it that claiming, ""Even when black and white ***people*** grow up in wealthy families... black ***boys*** are more likely to end up poor"" not obviously disingenuous to you? Did you forget that black females are people too? And how *LITERALLY 2 SECONDS LATER* he cites a statistic from a New York Times article that showed, indeed, wealthy black boys do end up worse, but wealthy black girls do BETTER than their white counterparts, which throws out the argument of it being a racial problem. Did you just stop watching after that or something?

425,fh9nsmx,"Almost all my suburban friends say something along the lines of ""black bitches aint my type"" , or ""I cant date a black girl, i dont find them attractive"" Which is to obviously mean they find black girls ugly. My friends are primarily white and asian (including indians) and whenever I bring my friends from where I live (suburbs) to my aunties place and over to my folks living in East Atlanta, they actually get along quite well with my old homies from the hood and my cousins group who I used to live with in the area but my parents moved us out when I was 7. So im at a crossroads of 2 different types of people interacting and I always find that my suburban folks never like going to the parties that my cousin links us up with. Which is kinda weird cuz they love partying on the weekends and try to find a place to ""bool"" everytime we hang **AND like i said before** they actually get along surprisingly well with some of the hoodrats that live on that street. When i confronted one of them about it , an indian dude, he told me ""Cuz nobody wants to go to there, so I dont go either"" So I asked him why that is and hes like ""Dude all the girls are black theres no girls of any other race"" I found it bizzare so i replied with ""We go to parties back in FoCo (Forsyth County) all the time that have literally only white folks and youre the only indian guy there but u still go there...."" And then he hesitated but told me yet again like all my other friends... He doesnt find black women attractive. His exact words were "" yeahhhhhhhh......... but black girls are uglah af.""

&amp;#x200B;

So it begs the question, why is this the case such that many if not most non-black males tend to stray away from black women or even completely rule them out as a potential partner?  Do black males face the same discrimination? it would appear not as so many black men (athletes or rappers or even normal fucking students) tend to bag the baddest bitches all around school. **I even controlled for their personalities, I suspected perhaps they find them intimidating as the media and a lot of meme culture depicts a lotta black women as being loud and having aggressive body language.** I asked them specifically and they had no problem admitting to me it was the *APPEARANCE* they were not fond of, not the possible demeanor. In fact, most black girls living in suburban georgia behave just like the white girls do. After some digging around and self-thinking Here is what I came to gather:

&amp;#x200B;

I want to start off by saying, at worst case scenario guys just dont find black women attractive, period. You are allowed to have your own preferences and even in that scenario no one is culpable for what they are attracted to. It is something you have no control over, although a lot of why people find the ""Caucasian standard of beauty - (large light color eyes, small, acute features, medium-small lips, exponential-curve arch nose etc.)""as the normal standard of beauty can be attributed to many things like media and shit, but thats a topic for sometime else. 

So yeah, dont feel bad if you find our women unattractive. I get it, although I highly encourage you to open your tastes up and give it a go and date some of them if u can.

With almost all of todays high schools being driven by clout, it DOES make it easier for black athletes and rappers to get girls as girls can be quite status-seeking at times and those black male individuals have a lot of clout to offer. Not to mention, athletes usually have better muscles and are leaner/taller which tend to be more desirable features. In addition, black males have been far more incorporated in media (advertising, social influencers , comedians ) than their female counterparts. For example, many of my friends cant name one african-american woman (famous singer or any celebrity ) they think is a 10/10 bombshell but many of my female friends can name black men they think that are 10/10 bombshells. 

So the point is, you never hear someone say ""I dont want to get to know a white/asian girl because Im not attracted to them."" but you do hear quite a bit of ""I dont want to get to know a black/arab girl because I am just not physically attracted to them""

Almost all black girls have black male partners ( just like most races) but black women are the least involved in biracial couples more than other minorities despite being the 2nd most populous in America. 

So yeah, I dont know WHY this is the case. perhaps its because of media and disney movies and shit we consume as children that have us dreaming about the fair-skinned beautiful princess way too much with barely any other minority representation. Perhaps, the common trend of black people having larger noses, big thick lips and nappy hair has something to do with it. But by far black women do have it the worst and are probably going to be the most single/unmarried group by the end of the decade."

428,fik9y8j,"Can you picture a desirable career that isnt dominates by ablebodied white men?

 Let's say a little boy wants to grow up to be a teacher and all the teachers hes ever seen are women, all his support at home have only seen women teacher. Do you think that would result in casual push back against his goals? ""What? Being a teacher is for girls. You should be a chef!"" Can you picture how seeing a male teacher when he starts middle school could be a big deal, to realize the mold of teacher is actually able to fit people like him? 

Or imagine someone in a wheelchair wanting to be a doctor. How many people do you think he would encounter that intentionally or subconsciously thinks ""what? How?"" Or doubts it. But then a new tv show comes out, Dr Scooter, about a doctor in a wheelchair and suddenly it's a cool dream and everytime he says that's what he wants to do, he gets ""fuck yeah  like Dr Scooter!"" How much of a difference that could make when studying gets hard and he thinks about dropping out? 

Children learn about the world by modeling what they see and classifying things accordingly. As you get older you can branch out from visuals but it's still the base. 

Theres a tragic study done where little black girls are shown a white doll and a black doll and asked which one is the ugly doll. And they always point to the black doll, since the Pretty character on TV is always the white girl. And then they get asked to point to the doll that looks most like them, and again they point to the black doll."
429,fjpt0xh,"&gt; It's only when I got in my 20s that I started to feel good about myself. Not because I had some kind of glow-up and it was suddenly revealed that deep down I was pretty all along like the Anne Hathaway in the princess diaries or Sandra Bullock in Miss Congeniality or any of the other 1000s movies with a similar 'plot twist'. What I realised was that I was pretty average looking, not ugly, but not stunning either. Just perfectly average like a lot of people.

I get that you're not trying to be dismissive but have you tried looking at it from an african-american women's perspective? From the names you've dropped can I assume you're white? 

If you are, try thinking about what its like to be averagely pretty black woman in such a looks centered world, think about how women on tv who look like you are usually only good looking as there is less of a pool of black women at all. Not to mention if you're dark skinned. Not to mention that 'good hair' is praised, that a lot of people around you are white and you don't look like them. Or that people are allowed to have preferences and they just..don't prefer black women.

&gt; I think it's more important to praise girls for what they ARE than delude every single one of them that they'll be pretty because god forbid they are not. I'm not saying tell someone flat out that they are ugly especially since things like ugly or pretty are subjective anyway.

This is a really nice sentiment and I agree, but in this case this kid needed cheering up because maybe she didn't get to ever hear she was pretty, and that in other peoples opinion she IS. Hearing 'black is beautiful' and that it's okay to be what you are is a movement I really like because of that. 

I really don't know if I got what I'm trying to say across to you u/Le_Fancy_Me I'm not the most eloquent at trying to communicate my point. I saw your comment though and how you seem like a genuine person that's not trying to be condescending or anything but I would suggest checking out r/blackladies and a few of the top posts there. Basically, when black girls are less likely to be called pretty when their white peers **are** its discouraging as fuck."
430,fjueler,I understood that I was ugly because of my skin and hair when I was in pre-school. Kids on tv and in advertisements didn’t look like me. The “pretty girl” in tv shows was always white and blond. Its was everywhere. My barbie dolls were white and pretty. My baby dolls were white and pretty. I was not. Kids at school would point out how absurd my hair was but that was mostly because they were consuming the same information about the world that I was. We were all on the same page. Black girls are ugly. There have been psych studies that have shown that this is how we learn racism and sexism. Its not from people telling us that women and black people are inferior its from everyone acting like women and black people are inferior because that is how our society is built to operate. Its an unspoken rule that is so clearly woven into everything we do that toddlers understand it just like how they understand language or facial expressions.
431,fjwthvk,"**Culture is meant to be practiced**, not shared. I would love to know how you came into that belief. it's one I once held myself. 

Yes when it's voluntarily shared it can be beautiful, and I champion that all the way, but when elements of cultures are ripped out of people's hands and bastardised, under the guise of cultural sharing, while marginalised groups are still being shafted by the larger establishment is Ugly imo. sure maybe a small minority of people go about it in a respectful manner, but having grown up in an international, primarily white neighbourhood in a non western country there is very little respectful intent when situations like these occur, from personal and anecdotal experience. you don't just get outright racists, which is a problem, but you have people who look at just the aesthetic of whatever they want to appropriate without thinking about the cultural context and significance. 

you have people fetishising elements of (in the US) blackness and black culture (see: r/Blackfishing ) and various indigenous cultures (sexy pocahantas vibes) while systemic problems such as missing indigenous and black girls are so deeply entrenched into the system. fuck, black girls from the US all the way to South Africa have to deal with hair discrimination, where their education is hindered because they can't wear natural styles, being deemed unkempt and uncivilized, while white women don't deal with institutional discrimination for wearing black hair. (Natural styles btw which are shaped around the curlier/coilier/kinkier hair types, which make a style like locs hygienic on black people but gross if you don't have the hair type that “locks” the hair together and instead you've artificially matted and teased chunks a la the Polish Plait.)

**The culture of these groups is recognized and celebrated but the humanity of the individuals is lost/forgotten in the process.** It's all well and good if you think your intention is genuine, but unless you've been invited into a certain practice it's likely you're missing a lot of context. When misinformation about smaller cultures is recorded and spread it damages the cultural identity. 

it may seem like I'm nitpicking but the little things add up. we live in a society and the actions of the current generation dont exist in a vacuum. The exotification of non-western cultures by Europeans has come hand in hand with the pillaging of resources and violence, and though it's nowhere near as blatant today, colonial violence still very much exists. Engaging in the same behaviour as colonists while decrying their motivations doesn't work because we are currently living out the direct consequences of European colonization. 

When there's better racial parity around the world, we can have a different discussion about intellectual properties and navigating that whole minefield but you need to start at a somewhat more equal footing otherwise you can't have a productive conversation about the many other dynamics behind cultural exchange."
432,fe1zle6,"&gt;The skinnier, more attractive black girls are well liked so I wouldn't say it's racism, just lookism.

I'd say there's still a major racial element here. Black women in particular are punished for being ugly, and have to work far harder to be seen as attractive and ""non-hostile""."
433,fe95482,"Dude chill out. I’m more so judging the picture, not you. But the post says girls who talk normal and girls who say bruh and nigga. The only girls show SHOULD say that are black girls. A very large majority of girls who do say that are black girls. So to imply that the girls who say that are ugly and masculine is to imply that black girls are ugly and masculine. Idk why I have to explain that, it’s pretty obvious. But once again, I’m talking about the picture, not you. I’m not saying you’re racist."
434,fed2e6k,"Because incels frequently want to add frustrated virgins to their ranks. The true Incel is the raging/depressed to the point of hopelessness who believes they have never received positive attention from females, they never will receive positive attention they want and the whole world is out to get them. 

You know what I mean when I say *Incel.*

But incels attract lonely virgin men who otherwise have normal relationships and aren’t filled with despair because incel communities allow them to rage and discuss controversial opinions and beliefs they have without telling them to shut up because they are acting entitled to sex, they are mansplaining, they are too young to be bothered by the things that worry them, life’s not like porn or media please get some real experience. 

And the real kicker is all teenagers and young adults have questionable beliefs about sex and dating whilst growing up, when I was 14-16 I pretty much accepted I was not going to get a long term SO until I was like 30 because I was a black girl in a majority white community and stereotypically black girls are less attractive to guys and also based on my mums friends and other black women I knew of etc they didn’t start settling properly until they were in their 30s if at all. 

Like I could not and still struggle to read when someone is into me. I just try not to believe systems or trends are hard fast rules. 

I didn’t consider myself ugly though because because I have enough body confidence that I rate myself pretty well when I want to spruce up and you get my good angle. 

So even though it’s unfair to compare I believe the ability have confidence in your looks and to ignore your negative projections or at least find a forum that doesn’t tend towards misogyny, catastrophe and wanting to tear one another down to vent is 100% something these not really incels are capable of."
435,ffqd24m,"I’m sorry but when someone deliberately say things like “all  black girls are ugly and annoying” that is racism. I’m not saying you have to be attracted to me in particular, but when people bring up “racial preferences” like this, white people are almost NEVER the race that’s excluded.

It’s insulting and tasteless that you would dumb down my experience to being nothing more than a child preferring a certain color toy. This is not a simple matter of preferring a certain color over another. You have a “subconscious” aversion to people of certain skin color. There’s a reason for this."

438,fgxgvxv,This has nothing to do with race at all. Black girls are not more ugly than other races at all.
439,fas2szm,"I totally agree with your ""initiative"" of taking the bull by the horns. I was wondering what you think of this preference that has been ""forced"" upon people to think black women are ugly. Who's fault is it? The media, or society's pre-existing preferences due to discrimination? Are people at fault for it too? Is this preference change-able, and should it even be changed (for those for whom its media-driven).

Also, its a bit ironic to be spitting on racism and calling these people with these preferences as ""dipshits"" when you say ghetto black girls are the ones who you would understand racism directed to them. Thats fucking shameful. Those women did not necessarily choose the ghetto, they did not necessarily want it, many of them probably dream of better lives, and you, knowing this, still shout against racism but not against racism directed to someone most likely born in some of the worst conditions, without a way of getting the life you are getting.

I agree with everything you say, but find the comment on ""ghetto black girls"" frankly nasty."
440,fbznnhv,"Straight white guy here.

There are incredibly attractive women of every race, but I have a few physical characteristics that I seem to find particularly beautiful/are always catching my eye. Dark skin and brown eyes being probly the best example, along with rounder or non-angular features. Through a combination of these things, it’s often the case that women with African features knock me off my fuckin feet. I grew up in the American deep south hearing other white guys talk about how ugly/strange looking/off-putting black girls are, and at the time I just thought they were racist. Now I think they’re racist and blind, because my god black women are so beautiful. They just, I just, it just, how even. How do they do that. How do they do that all of the time. Does it ever switch off? Do they take breaks? Boggles my mind.

Its been suggested that I’m a fetishist, but I don’t think thats what it is. I don’t think anyone who appreciates the hell out of black women is automatically a fetishist. Plus I do have actual fetishes and they feel very different."

443,fd6oro2,Black girls are ugly. You are the losers of the evolutionary race.
444,fde3d3v,"I guess I would be surprised. Because that legit sounds like, “Black girls are ugly and somehow...you’re not.”

It’s not even close to being a compliment. It’s a fucking insult. And it’s DEFINITELY racism. Personally, I’m white, so I guess I can’t say shit... But personally, I would call people out and just respond with “that’s very racist. Have you ever said you look pretty for a white girl? No right? That’s because you think white girls are pretty BY DEFAULT but you think black girls are ugly by default. Think about what you said.”

Fucking people.

Also, not that it matters, but I’m a white guy who’s always tried to date black girls (all girls really) since I was in my teens. I think women are beautiful, period. Beauty is defined by facial symmetry and features. There is no color in beauty. 

They say little babies even know a pretty face when they see one. And babies smile at a pretty face no matter the color."
445,f53yf5a,"&gt;Yes, but I like the porcelain pale look that Slavic girls and CKJ Asian girls have. Korean girls literally have ""glass skin"". Black women also get ashy and dry, not a good look. 

That doesn't bother me as much, their skin is soft enough for me. Skin that's too soft is not really my thing, but you do you

&gt;They also wear wigs and many cannot grow their own hair. Yeah, you'll call me racist, nope these are actual facts. Many of them buy hair from Asian women.

That is racist because there are many black women who can grow their hair and don't wear wigs. Look at all the black men with long dreads / locks in the NFL, NBA, real life, etc. They are certainly not wearing wigs or have hair extensions, so if they can grow their hair out, so can their female counterparts. Also look at black women from Ethiopia and Somalia, some of them have straight natural hair

&gt;Russian women literally throw their babies in the snow to toughen them up and as a result Russian guys are alpha as hell. 

Lol, and black guys aren't alpha as hell? Look at all the top athletes in the NBA, NFL, UFC, Boxing, Olympic sports (sprinting, long distance running, etc.), all dominated by black people. And look at the last World Cup Champion, France, who had majority African players on their team.

&gt;You don't need to get a muscular black women when you can just find traditional Russian girl.

Maybe, but many immigrant African girls are traditional as well, and so are some black American girls, believe it or not.

&gt;Well the women on there would tell you otherwise, they all call themselves woke and shit

Yea maybe 1 out of every 20 is woke. The rest are hood rats, hardly a good representation of them. Some even bash black men who have done nothing wrong

&gt;You can't cherrypick black supermodels. Most black women aren't supermodels and most men aren't interested in them. Stop pretending.

There are plenty of attractive black women who aren't celebrities / supermodels. Just look at all the WMBF couples popping up dude.

And don't pretend like all white women or EE women are supermodels either. I've seen hot white women, average white women, and fat &amp; ugly white women. There are attractive and unattractive women of all races

&gt;I want my kid to have an ancestry to be proud of. Therefore, I would have kids with a European/Asian/ME girl. Maybe you have a fetish for big black asses, but I'm looking into this deeper. Africa literally never even thought of the wheel.

You're looking into this deeper and yet you think the black stereotype applies to all black people lol. And did you even read all the comments? There are parts of Africa that used the wheel (Ethiopia, Egypt, Somalia), and the parts that didn't because they didn't need it. 

Besides, all of our ancestors came from Africa anyways, and you can be proud of yourself without a great history. Just ask any black person if they are proud of being black and most of them will say hell yea"
446,f542k1g,"&gt;That doesn't bother me as much, their skin is soft enough for me. Skin that's too soft is not really my thing, but you do you

Have you ever had sex with a slavic girl? Their skin is soft, trust me.

&gt;That is racist because there are many black women who can grow their hair and don't wear wigs.

It's a known fact that it takes black women a much longer time to achieve long hair like white/asian/me women. Their hair is more course and dry so it snaps back into a curl when you stretch it out.

&gt;Just look at all the WMBF couples popping up dude.

I have never seen WMBF couple in my city, and have seen them like 3 times in my life. I also wouldn't define a woman beauty by white guy standards, look at the yellow fever white guys who date ugly Asian girls that Asian guys didn't want.

&gt;And don't pretend like all white women or EE women are supermodels either.

There are more beautiful, fit, slavic girls than african women women. Most african american women are obese. These are actual facts, not pulling it out of my ass.

&gt;Maybe, but many immigrant African girls are traditional as well, and so are some black American girls, believe it or not.

If they were traditional, then Africa wouldn't be plagued with AIDS, and 49% of black women wouldn't have herpes.

&gt;There are parts of Africa that used the wheel (Ethiopia, Egypt, Somalia),

Lands that were visited/conquered by Arabs. Asians and whites don't really have a history of being conquered and oppressed by other races. African history is just ""ok let's see, what race of people decided to invade and enslave Africans in this time period"". Does that sound fucked? yeah. is it true? also yeah.

It seems like you're into black women just because they have fat asses, whereas slavic girls are more likely to be skinny, traditional, have huge breasts, soft skin, beautiful cultural clothing, sexy accents, and deep history."
447,f7fynnp,Just because they are black peoples everywhere doesn’t mean that a lot  people don’t think black girls are ugly just for being black. I’m not saying that we aren’t everywhere if I did say that in the post tell me where so I can correct it
448,f7pb2xg,Because according to many studies black girls are the ugliest race and gender mix in America. So black girls including my self feel the need to ask so they can not be insecure with something they can’t change. Some days I feel like the most useless ugly girl. All because I’m black. I’m asking this question in specific because I feel like England is a lot better and they have lots of more men that like black women. I mean lots of them actually like black women like they like other races. They don’t just tolerate us. Sorry if this just sounds sad and stuff but it is. The saddest part is it isn’t anybody’s fault a good amount of people don’t like black girls.
449,f857cjg,"First off you can’t change the fact that you’re black, so why should you care? Its not like black girls are automatically uglier, and I haven’t met a guy Second off you seem really hot to me. The opposite of ugly. Maybe different hair, but honestly that would be it."
450,f89d9pe,"You are not a incel you are just a larper, you don’t know what is like to be ugly, how can you say “black girls are attracted to you” and then larp as an incel because you don’t like them. I’ve realised many of you are fakes."
451,f8odsdv,"I was watching a tiktok the other day of a black girl w natural hair, and my cousin looked over and said she’s ugly. First of all, SHE WASNT UGLY, SHE WAS LIKE SUPER PRETTY. So I asked him why and he said, “I don’t like her hair”, when her hair was in a BEAUTIFUL twistout. I then pointed out that this was her natural hair, and he has no right to judge just like how no one judges people with naturally straight hair. Then something else happened and he actually had the AUDACITY to say “well black girls are just ugly”, and it made me realize how prevalent racism still is. We are all black, my entire country is black, yet most kids are taught shit like this, women relax their hair and bleach their skin to be ‘pretty’, and the darker skinned get treated like shit. It’s such a sad thing."

457,f4yjyrk,"No one says that black girls can’t attract guys. It’s just overwhelmingly we are seen as *less* attractive then other races. Naomi is less attractive then Stacey and is on par with Becky, maybe not. A lot of us average black girls are made to feel extremely ugly. Men have continuously expressed their dislike for black women, so if we attract someone there’s the psychological and real possibility on feeling settled on. 

And the stats back up those feelings and experiences."
458,f5bhlka,"i am a trump supporter. and i love mixed girls and black girls i doesn't matter what race someone is just as long as there nice, loyal, and loved me back. i have one rule i don't fuck with latinos, just who i am but i think black girls are beautiful and white, asian and not saying latinos are ugly just some stuff happened."
459,f5lbkv5,And race preferences. These ugly black girls are so damn ugly
460,f5rxjaz,Gonna need a bit more really. You could be ugly or you could be unbearable as a person. I think black girls are cute so it’s difficult to say. Reading your history and your upbringing could have something to do with it with the way you’re interacting but it’s difficult to give advice off such little information
461,f6nsdot,"They want to look like mixed Black girls. Are you retarded *and* blind? Lmao. I’m a light skinned black woman and men find us hot as hell. People just ignore that we exist when they NEED to go with the “black girls are ugly” stereotype. Truth is, your average white girl is boring as hell and not attracting a ton of guys. But that cute caramel colored black girl with the fat ass most definitely is.

&amp;nbsp;

If you have to deny this it’s a hard cope. I knew how guys treated me back when I cared about them. 😝"

464,f0qtsxg,"No... I live in a big college town around lots of people everyday &amp; I noticed this. Asians date some of the weirdest, or least attractive white guys around. Latinas date more average/normal looking White guys. Pretty Black girls actually date much better looking, more masculine types of White guys than average. And the anime loving, awkward Black girls who do date, are usually also with ugly white guys. So maybe you meant those women would compete with Asians? Idk, but pretty Black girls are notttttt ever going to date neckbeards and fat, socially awkward white guys. That would be a new low! Hahahahahahahahaha. Those guys know that too. That's why they're stuck with Asians! They'll never get the Laura Harrier or even Gabrielle Union looking girls. OMG I couldn't even imagine lol. You know I'm right. If I ever saw a hot Black girl with a short, skinny little White guy who looks like he argues about his favorite manga a lot then I'll GLADLY accept defeat and take a step back for our group, but it hasn't happened. Haha"

467,f2nkb38,"I was seeing this black girl for a bit and things ended kind of awkwardly. We were skyping and my sister came in and was trying to convince me to get with one of her ugly friends who just got out of a relationship. Her boyfriend then mentioned that a friend of his was single and my sister very loudly said ""She's black, he doesn't like black girls. He told me before."" I tried to correct her and say that ""it's true that I said most black girls are unattractive to me, but it doesn't hold 100% true."" 

She disconnected pretty much immediately and no amount of attempts to correct things worked"
468,f31ti71,"There’s no growing number of anything. There’s just sexist misogynistic men like there always have been except now they can make little weird communities where they talk about how awful women are. Ya some women are judgemental shallow bitches.. why would you want them to fuck you anyway? I’m a woman of color and there’s a lot of racist men who talk about how ugly black girls are, I don’t want fuck them either. But you guys join a community where you make up sexist terms and talk about women the same way serial killers do and that makes you not well adjusted and more than it makes women VERY turned off."
469,f358ieh,"Yeah! I’ve noticed that too. I’m not sure why it is. I get the sense that Black women are taken less seriously than back then, unless they’re older, wise &amp; motherly. Younger Black girls are seen as caricatures. People would likely see Lizzo as grotesque and off-putting if she were white. Society doesn’t want to see “ugly” white women in general, so an overweight white woman with cellulite twerking would be a huge no. A black girl though? The idea is that she’s having fun and can’t help it, as if black women cant not be overtly sexual. Even Whitney Houston would be in booty shorts these days. We’ve gone back to the old stereotype that black women always want/need sex and aren’t getting enough of it. I’d say black women are seen as being “starving for sex” &amp; sexually available in a way that white women aren’t. White women are seen as sexy, but sexually unavailable (hard to get), there’s a big difference there."
470,ewwonrz,"The white men and asian women couples are usually two ugly people who both acted like they won a prize by being with the other for their race. From the outside-in, it’s 99% of the time just some ugly creeps who fetishize the race of the other (&amp; likely couldn’t do much better. Ugly, gross white guys can only really get ugly, gross or scarily homely asian chicks. It’s gross seeing them together and the kids they have are usually plain too, even ugly! But they act like they’re cute for being mixed 😰).

&amp;nbsp;

So yeah, those couples are just gross! Although it pains me to admit, I think *some* black girls are also starting to add to this. Tall handsome white dudes aren’t usually with asian women."
471,ex6c6ny,"That's true, but I realized that most guys aren't like the neckbeards on reddit. Most guys will date you if you're cute regardless of race. That's what I've noticed over the past few years after I glowed up. All types of guys started liking me after I got in really good shape, and I was surprised because I've frequently heard men online say ""black girls are ugly"" or ""I'd never date a black girl"" but I have no problem attracting cute guys from every race. If you're cute, you're cute. End of story. 

If a guy finds you attractive but won't date you purely because you're black, then why would you even want to date a moron like that? You wouldn't be losing out on anything."
472,exwb1m0,"she ugly

vast majority of black girls are ugly af. which is why I need to hit on black women. it's time to be realistic, I can't get white or arab women."
473,ey49pgb,"Lol seriously.

I didn't say that I think all black girls are ugly, nor did I say I wouldn't date and/or hook up with a girl because she was black. Literally all that I said was that I'm usually not attracted to black girls. In no way does that say or infer that I think being black makes a girl unattractive"
474,ey4l5mg,"Word, people skimmed my comment and saw ""I think black girls are ugly."" I've only ever dated 1 100% black girl, and hooked up with 2 total. So black girls don't make up a very large part of my body count lol. That's not racism. It's just facts lol"

476,ezbsves,"Want the hard truth? People reject you because you’re ugly and they associate your ugliness with your race, just like you do. Pretty black girls are seen as special to a lot of those same guys, so they fetishize the pretty ones and many guys will date the pretty black girl because it makes her “exotic” and different in his eyes. But for you?... you’re in the negative stereotype already so you seem to think ALL black females are and that’s where you’re wrong. The bigger issue is that a lot of black girls would be pretty but they’re fat and that in itself puts them in the ugly category by men."
477,ezbtuke,That’s what I’m saying. I’m trying to not be upset because there are ugly nb girls but I feel like average black girls are overlooked and deemed ugly anyways. I put emphasis on race because knowing where I am on the spectrum from ugly to pretty if I were a nb black girl I know things would be different.

487,ew66oj4,"I was kind of expecting reactions like this at some point but nope, I disagree. I feel like with a good portion of femcels, any guy can use you for sex, it doesn't mean he actually finds you attractive or worthy enough to ever want to be with you. It's kind of like how cels can pay for prostitues, but that doesn't make them any less inc*l. There are a ton of guys willing to fuck anything and everything. Even this guy in particular had that kind of reputation, I just thought it would be different because we were friends and he called me cute a few times. 

His ex girlfriend was literally hated by half the school for being annoying, fat, and that 'sjw' (god I hate that term, but it's the best way to describe her) type. She was subpar like me looks wise, but was only really saved because she had like 'popular' qualities (naturally blonde hair and blue eyes). He even kept complaining about how she was annoying and would constantly call her ugly when they were dating for the astoundingly long period of a week. I don't think I'm any less of a femcel because a desperate guy with no standards was willing to touch me and then ignore me, and it doesn't erase my experiences that have led up to this. And also, I agree stacies get insulted an compared, but the sheer volume and detail of insults ive received for my looks is unreasonable. Part of it is because I'm a below average black girl, but the other huge part of it is that where I live, black girls are not the ideal in the first place and therefore are not even allowed to be below average, lest you end up being deemed as just horrendously ugly. He probably didn't even genuinely think I was attractive, he just wanted someone to do it with. I don't even want to go in on him as a person, because there's LOTS I could say, but I was desperate for male attention and what he said at the time made me feel good and wanted.

Truth be told, there must be mysoginistic fucks on inc***.me that will fuck a femcel with a bag over our head, but they don't view you as worth the time or more valuable than that if you're not a 10/10 skinny white stacy.

Also, it's my first time doing anything like this, prior to this I had no sexual experience at all ( probably contibuted to how uncomfortable I was ) Because ive now had oral sex (we literally didn't do anything more than that), i wouldnt consider myself a virgin, but celibacy doesn't necessarily mean virginity."

Like, I can tell if a guy is attractive, but he's not going to be attractive *to me* because I'm not into dudes. By your logic that means I'm a homophobic hate-monger. Get real."
493,etsg99m,"Either way, whether you find it racist or not, the statement implies that the majority of black girls are ugly. This makes it a shitty thing to say. So don't say it. I, as a male who is as white as white gets, have never been told, and have never heard someone be told that they are pretty for a caucasian. Speed and strength are not opinionated characteristics. What is not fast simply isn't fast, no matter who you ask. Beauty is subjective. What's beautiful to me probably isnt what's beautiful to you. This is why it's important to watch how you talk about it. It's not offensive to say someone runs slower than most. It is pretty offensive however to tell someone they're not as good looking as most. It is not okay to put down an entire race just to compliment one person."
494,eudr2xc,"Yeah I like mixed men mainly because they’re mostly attracted to me. All the guys I’ve dated were Afro Latino. Never dated a white guy or an Asian or a non black Latino but I would like to try that (leaning more towards Asian). My dad’s side isn’t really colorist. I wouldn’t consider my dad pro black but he does speak about colorism and always says how black boys are the problem and tells me to stay natural and don’t wear weave etc. he’s the one who gave me confidence and reassured me of my beauty. My mom on the other hand, a self hating black woman who’s basically a stereotype- I just have no respect for her. She always said how she wished I was mixed because my life would be easier and always compared my hair texture to people with 4a curls and looser and just compared me to everyone else.  When I told her people builder me in these white schools she put me in and called me ugly and treated me different because I was black she told me to get over it. My dad didn’t respond that way.I don’t have low self esteem anymore but the problem is she does. She’s always the man in the relationship and very masculine and acts like a mom to the men she dates. My dad doesn’t deal with her because she’s difficult and crazy. I went really off topic but yeah my moms side is full of self hating black women to praise and idolize my cousins who are barely black (mostly women darker than me that do it), but on my dad’s side they don’t treat my light skin cousins differently (even though I don’t know many mixed relatives on his side).  My dad wants me to be with a black man and I guess two of my nieces don’t like black men and he got offended but I told him why should we have to hold out for men who think we’re ugly, nappy headed, and repulsive ?🌚Moral of the story my mom’s side of the family is just self hating especially the women and my dad’s side is the one that isn’t scared to speak on colorism and problems like that. I feel like some of these black single moms just want everyone to be miserable and bitter just like them. I need iyanla to fix her life lmfao."

This *is* a joke right? You guys aren't REALLY paying THAT much attention to a COLOR on a HUMAN BEING are you? I look at a human being and that is all I see. A HUMAN BEING, just like myself.

505,el6z6ca,"I don’t think that showing black women, especially dark skinned black women being beautiful is a bad thing, especially when you consider the fact that young black girls are not the only ones who are influenced by black female role models. 

I can’t tell you how many men and boys throughout my life have told me that they think black women are unattractive. I could find you countless posts on this site written by men of all ages and races who felt the need to declare publicly how ugly they find black women. Hell, even on this sub, you’re constantly seeing posts about how black women, especially dark skinned black women, have a harder time dating and finding men who want to commit to them because they are seen as bottom of the barrel or the least desirable pick when it comes to dating. 

And I understand that we’re supposed to be independent, and not rely on outside validation for self worth, but the fact is that these things affect the quality of life for black women. When we are constantly being picked last, when we are tossed aside and put on the back burner, when we are constantly being told that we are not ideal partners because of how we look, that affects us. It affects the way we feel about ourselves and it affects our overall quality of life. 

And sure, we deserve more diverse representation. But more people need to see black women being beautiful and glamorous."

518,ek297iw,"You mean like not wanting to feel like your destined to be a dumb ugly criminal because your born black?  I get it, sometimes I need to remind myself that black people aren't dumber, but the stereotype of low academic achievement is a result of property taxes being used to fund schools and seeing as for a long time black people were barred from well paying jobs they couldn't afford big houses with high property taxes and thus school in predominantly black neighborhoods wound up chronically underfunded leading to black kids being poorly educated and thus unable to get into good universities or gain access to highly paying jobs, so couldn't afford houses with higher property taxes which would better fund the schools their own children would go to.


I actually started subscribing to Instagram and Tumblr account that only post pictures of dark skinned black women.  Not because I think white people are ugly, because I couldn't figure out why I didn't think of myself as pretty, I have high enough self esteem.  I realised the problem was that my whole life I'd seen images of beautiful white women far more often than I'd seen images of beautiful black ones and so did not associate my own features with beauty.  Take for example the modeling industry.  Where often, only one black women is hired for a show or campaign and the phrase ""we already have a black girl"" is a reason for not hiring a model.  Dark skinned black  girls are often unsuccessful in the industry.  Girls with afro's are told to straighten their hair or shave their heads.  Girls told to get a more 'petit' nose.

And do we even need to talk about the crime thing.

But white people are told they can't post on an internet forum and in less then a day are dropping the N-word and engaging in a dangerously Aryan circle jerk."

If a 13 or like 14 year old sees all of the ""black girls are ugly"" stuff and also have never had a boyfriend or any reassurance then just imagine how shitty that'd make them feel. I'm 17 I understand why people say this shit really generally but someone younger than me won't and probably bjust think that because they're black that ruins their chance of being pretty. I know because I've seen it happen multiple times.  Have you seen Tommy Sotomayor? Just look at his comments section. The fact that he gets the amount of views he does talking about this subject feels wrong. I understand preference completely,I have preference myself it's just the calling black women ugly in comparison to (insert race here) definitely feels like calling us lesser."

526,ehd8y6k,"I mean good on him for having those specific set of standards. Growing up, it was hard. I permed my hair for many years because it was just something I grew up with. It was a normal to smash your head in with chemicals that are harmful af. I grew up watching other black girls getting asked what the fuck was wrong with their hair just because it was different.  

Black girls are now getting suspended and expelled from schools for not straightening their hair... X_X.  It's an actual stuggle. So when ppl do this type of crap, it does bring up the past. 

When you perm, you can get alopecia. I did. My hair is very sensitive and it falls out easily. I take supplements and take care of my body. It's like maintenance. Nobody understands that my ass can't just wake up, wash, and straighten my hair every damn day. Where it will take one girl 3 hours, it will take me 6 to 8 bitch!

 I'm honestly sick of people who step on others when they've never been in their shoes. I never saw anything wrong with my hair. Society did. Tbh, fuck society. 

They give you choices and then make fun of you for trying to change what they said was a problem. 

You can perm it, braid it, lace it up, place a fucking wig on it!!! At the end of the day, assholes will talk. It's like black women are puppets for ppl to toy with. Too black, too white, too ugly, too ghetto, too fat, booty, too much attitude, nappy headed, brillo-head, whatever. It's just a damn game for people to knock others down a peg. 

This is because asshats have a knack of tearing others down to build themselves up, but they will never want to look at the damage they do. You can't be yourself, and you can't be what they want you to be either. Just fuck em' -.-

[""I think that there needs to be a profound change in the way the Democratic Party does business,"" Sanders said. ""It is not good enough to have a liberal elite. I come from the white working class, and I am deeply humiliated that the Democratic Party cannot talk to where I came from.""](https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/bernie-sanders-humiliated-democrats-loss-working-class-voters/index.html)

And there's this, from a Rolling Stone interview asking about he and Trump ""drawing from the same stream of voters"":

[Here's what the common denominator is: To the media's great shock and to the pundits' great shock, there are millions of Americans who are very, very angry. And they're angry because they're working longer hours for lower wages. They're angry because they're working two and three jobs. They're worried about the future of their children – getting decent jobs and getting homes. And then they look at the leadership of the Democratic Party and the leadership of the Republican Party and they don't see people addressing – or even paying attention to – their needs. And Trump comes along and starts to blame Mexicans or Muslims or women for the problems facing society. The people are seeing that someone at least is speaking to their anger. And that's unfortunate. That's a very ugly approach. But that's why he's succeeding.
We are also addressing the anger of the American people. [But] in a constructive way. And that is to say: We've got to bring people together. Do the exact opposite of Trump, who is trying to divide us up. To look at the real causes for why the middle class is declining, and develop public policy that addresses the needs of working families.](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/bernie-sanders-fights-on-the-rolling-stone-interview-61639/)

Is he suggesting that Muslim working class families are blaming Muslims? Or that Mexican working class families are blaming Mexicans? Obviously not. The ""anger"" at Muslims and Mexicans and women is coming from whites, and mostly white men, and he readily admits that this is who he is targeting, maybe without even realizing he's doing it.

And while it doesn't specifically mention the working class, his comment that white people who are uncomfortable voting for black candidates aren't racist is clearly trying to appeal to a group of white voters, and I don't think anyone's going to argue that it's college educated ones. 

As for ""identity politics,"" I'll quote from the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-politics/]:

&gt;The laden phrase “identity politics” has come to signify a wide range of political activity and theorizing founded in the shared experiences of injustice of members of certain social groups. Rather than organizing solely around belief systems, programmatic manifestos, or party affiliation, identity political formations typically aim to secure the political freedom of a specific constituency marginalized within its larger context. Members of that constituency assert or reclaim ways of understanding their distinctiveness that challenge dominant oppressive characterizations, with the goal of greater self-determination.


I have trouble seeing that as a bad thing, as much as he and his supporters seem to want me to. The problem I do see, though, is two things:

1. I do not think I have any right, and Bernie Sanders doesn't either, to tell marginalized groups that they need to care about class problems over the marginalization that they feel. I think it shows a lack of respect and tone deafness for their experiences that are not mine or his. 

2. I think he sees virtually every problem as an economic one, and I think that's unrealistic and, again, tone deaf. We already know, thanks to a [decades-long study of millions of people](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html) that even if they both grow up rich, white boys are far more likely to remain that way than black boys are. This is not something that can be solved by making billionaires pay for free college and Medicare for All. 

You said ""it would be dumb to sell policies to a public that's 70% white as being meant for people of color,"" but what seems to be happening instead is that the concerns of whites are being catered to and people of color are expected to go along with it. Like 11% of associates and bachelors degrees go to blacks in this country, but blacks are supposed to see free college as a good policy and vote for it while the same is not be asked of whites on issues of ""identity politics.""

In that same vein, Sanders saying ""it's not enough to say I'm a woman vote for me"" and ""it's not enough to say I'm a Latino vote for me"" is a massive strawman. It was just as unfounded when it was used against Clinton and her supporters, and apparently it's only been made more diverse here. It's not even the first time he's said it, he did the same thing in a GQ interview. 

&gt;Many of my opponents do not hold that view, and they think that all that we need is people who are candidates who are black or white, who are black or Latino or woman or gay, regardless of what they stand for, that the end result is diversity.


How this isn't ridiculously offensive is beyond me.

532,eees3ta,"What fucking dog whistles? I already explained the racism I'm talking about. Do you want actual examples?

I worked with a lot of people of different races when I was in college. I knew black people that said ""White people all smell bad. White people are liars."" I knew black people that said ""light skinned black guys are full of themselves and liars so I won't date them."" I knew white people that said ""Black girls are all ugly and lazy"". I've met every kind of white/black racist in the last few years. I don't know why you don't think it's real. You can find countless stories of places where white people aren't allowed now because people need a safe space from them. Fuck anything like that. Fuck anything where people can't go somewhere because of what color they are. We need to treat each other based on the merits of our character and not what color our parents happened to be. "

Because of this I think guys see me as something new and shiny and want to pump and dump. That’s white and Asian guys anyway, so I’ve learnt to keep a guard up when it comes to them. 
Black guys are actually the best and nicest in my opinion, and are generally genuinely looking for a long term thing and because of that like to look within their own race. 
I think people will always try to pick one type of person as “having it worst” so they can feel better about themselves. Oh “nobody likes Asian guys” or “black girls are ugly”. But if you look at the people making these comments they generally have some self hating going on. If a wo/man is attractive, no matter her race, people will gravitate towards them.

540,ec02mgq,"It's one thing being unattractive, and it's a completely other thing being of a different color. Being black doesn't really make you unattractive, and if anyone thinks otherwise, then I'm afraid that they may be racist. You're beautiful just the way you are, after all, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Some guys may prefer blondes over you because they like blondes, but some guys may prefer you over blondes because you look pretty to them. For example, one of my male friends likes a girl because he thinks she is really beautiful, but my other male friends says that she looks like an ugly lizard. See? It depends on what you prefer. There's not really attractive and unattractive races or appearances, it depends on how someone sees you. Personally, I think black girls are way prettier than white girls. You barely get acne, have amazing hair, and you look 30 when you're 50. Embrace that.

It made me clutch my pearls because this black girl, who you say is in a position of weakness and recipient of hate, saw a black guy liking her (black girls complain about black guys not liking them) and she humiliates him.

Most people I know are able to list attractive men/women from every race. I'm highly skeptical of people who say stuff like ""I don't find X people attractive"" only because the few guys I know in my personal life who have said that *were* racists (for unrelated reasons).

One of these guys was an old coworker of mine. I remember him saying during after work drinks that he didn't think black girls are attractive. We started showing him pictures of clearly beautiful black women and he just kept saying ""nope. She's not attractive. Nope. Oh she's ugly. Nope. Oh she has a nice body but her face is shocking."" 

I thought fair enough. Flash forward a few months and he uses the n word to describe an old black woman who cut him off in traffic and starts talking about how awful black people are. 

Ahhhhh. It all makes sense now. 

I guess what I'm saying is that if you find a whole ethnicity of human beings incapable of being attractive you probably have some negative opinions about them. 

It's fine to find certain traits attractive over others. I love blonde girls and find that super attractive. But I can also list thousands of gorgeous brunettes.

551,ecow1kj,"I’m sorry but how is THIS going to help this girl? I asked a similar question on my account about why people would constantly tell me I was pretty for a black girl and you’re explanation is horrible. All you basically said is “Well most Black girls are ugly, but your probably not! That’s great right? But you should totally not hold a grudge against these people that just mocked and excluded you because of your race and facial features and just let it go!” Dude what kind shit is that? I don’t mean to be rude but I can grantee as a black girl myself that’s only going to make her more angry. You don’t know how many times I’ve been told “You’re pretty for a black girl” in my life and people constantly asking me what I’m mixed with or what race I look more like. And to have people just shove in your face that “Yup you’re entire group is trash but you’re just a gem compared to that!” Makes me want to snap.

And then also, they act like science is immune to racism which is so dumb, especially when it comes to social science like studying human attraction. In conclusion that commenter is a bitch "
554,ed1rjlt,"Black men have justified their love and adoration for non black women for years. You can save your breath dude. 

The same guys who hate girls who wear wigs and weaves yet prefer white women, would gawk in horror at the prospect of dating a black girl with a short, thick Afro, period. You say nothing about being attracted to natural black hair but are quick to judge women for wearing weaves that enable them to be seen as professionals in the white world that is in control. 

Date who you want to date. I’m fortunately not one of those black girls who hate black men who date white women, because like you, I was raised around none black people and that is who I am attracted to as well (to the anger and judgement of many black men, but that’s a comment for another day). 

You will never know what it is like to be judged for when your natural hair because you can always keep it short. You. will never know irritating feeling of being judged by your own people for wearing wigs and weaves despite them understanding the historical and current context that causes us to do so. Ironically, I feel the most judged by other black people like you. Other races do nothing but compliments my skin tone, my braids, my weaves, and my natural hair. Just yesterday a white woman was raving about my skin tone. Happens more than you’d thing. 

Before I go on I have to admit this. I am a former black femcel with what I think is an interesting perspective on this topic.

My experience does not invalidate OP because unlike her I have attractiveness privilege (yes I am a lurker and I am sorry) which has actually made me being black and positive in my daily and dating life.  Puberty was good to me and I developed from a femcel to a Naomi I believe they call it, but I was once treated like OP and know that everything she’s saying is 100% correct. Granted I live in liberal states (Cali and NY) but being an educated Naomi has made more rich non black men chase after me than even my Stacy friends. Yes some fetishize but not most (especially the educated ones) 

I’d also like to add that my experience evolving has shown me that while yes there are a lot of insecure men who “hate” black girls, they’re mostly projecting, and are afraid to validate black beauty that to most is undeniable. When I was a black femcel,  no one that wasn’t a black gave me the time of day. Now that I am “approachable” I cannot tell you how many times I have heard white man say black girls are intimidating and hard to approach. Nine times out of 10 Non black men are afraid to hit on a black girl because they feel like they only like black men and are afraid to be laughed at. Blackfemcels really are at the bottom of the barrel, not because black skin is disgusting, but because black girls are hard to approach anyways, if you’re ugly there really is no point. This is coming from a former black femcel. 


Back to you commentator- You can state your preferences without tearing down black women. You say you are not self hating but your words state otherwise. Uplift to your sisters. You don’t need to date them in order to understand and to celebrate them. That’s what I do for my black brothers even though I have no interest in dating them. "
555,ed2rrcb,"Ok, let's do this. I expected a post exactly like this, ignoring everything that I've said just so you can assert your own preconceived notions onto me. I'm not justifying anything, because justification would imply that I am wrong somehow. I've given insight and a worthy explaination on my account. It it YOU who still does not like the words because I said I'm more attracted to white women generally. I made that a point as well. 

It is disrespectful to automatically group me in as one who ""gawks in horror at the prospect of dating black women"". It is unfair to do so, especially when I have made it clear that I do not treat any women badly nor exclude, principally on race. Quit being overdramatic and ridiculous. You must have conveniently missed the part where I said I find girls I'm attracted to in all races, but yet when I point out me being a black guy who likes white girls, you go off on a slight tangent. I also did not judge black women on wigs, weaves, etc. What I said and verbatim, was ""I like black girls...who don't wear fake hair"". That is not judgement. That is literally expressing a preference. That is the truth you blatantly avoided so that you could make out to be the bad guy. 



&gt;You will never know what it is like to be judged for when your natural hair because you can always keep it short. You will never know the irritating feeling of being judged by your own people for wearing wigs and weaves despite them understanding the historical and modern context that motivates us to do so.

Just yesterday a white woman was raving about my skin tone. Happens more than you’d think.

It doesn't matter if I will never know what it's like to be judged cor natural hair. This topic has nothing to do with that! It's about preferences that are targeted at race. Idk why you felt the need to include yet another pathos appeal. Furthermore, you don't even know what I look like. As a matter of fact, I do not have short hair, as I hate having to conform to be like having ""waves"" or a short bald fade or something. I have hair on my head that I tend to everyday and go through struggles of my own with. MY natural hair. I do not relax it. I do not texturize it. I've looked at countless videos on youtube about wash and gos, TWA, etc. I have a hair routine. And most days I'm proud of my hair. It's curly and looks good. I also cut my own hair. Give myself a low bald fade, shape myself up, etc. I care A LOT about my hair. And for you to assume that just because im a black man and that I know nothing about what black women face, is an insult to me! Sometimes I feel as if my hair isn't good enough, but people have complimented me on it. So yes, I know it happens, thanks for implying that I'm ignorant once again. I have dark skin as well. I understand the beauty standards too! I can feel insecure and inferior to those with lighter skin too! I'm practically around them all the time. I've been bullied by countless black people, but yet I still try to uplift us in my own way. By understanding racism, colorism, sexism, the crime rates and the history of how drugs and gangs came to be such big issues in Black Americans. Don't you dare point the finger and talk about how people like me judge you. You don't understand anything about me, lady! Honestly, the nerve of you. 

I know the history of why black women feel the need to wear wigs, weaves, and extensions. And those who truly understand and get it do not judge you! I'm not talking about the ones who call you out of your name or whatever. I'm talking about the ones who dig deep into the psychological reasons as to why. And try to inspire others to understand exactly why they do it. I know it's hard. Even as a black man, I know I don't get the same harsh criticisms as black women do about hair or other ""realms of beauty"", but it hurts when I can't even ask my own mother about my hair and talk to her about it because ""men aren't supposed to care about their hair. That's for women"". Oh right, I'm supposed to either keep it low cut or have dreads or twists right? Because who cares if I actually try to give a damn about my hair as a black man right? 

&gt;And no, they (especially the educated ones) don’t fetishize me, at least not any more than you fetishize the white girls you prefer. 

I do not fetishize any woman that I'm interested in. Just because I'm attracted to other races, it doesn't mean I fetishize them. Honestly, the only judgemental one here is you. You've assumed to much about me without even understand an inkling of who I am. 

&gt;I’d also like to add that my experience evolving has shown me that while yes there are a lot of insecure men who “hate” black girls, they’re mostly projecting, and are afraid to validate black beauty that to most is undeniable.

Blackfemcels really are at the bottom of the barrel, not because black skin is disgusting, but because black girls are hard to approach anyways, if you’re ugly there really is no point. This is coming from a former black femcel

No girls give me the time or day currently but yet I still continue to try and improve myself. My dress, my style, my appearance, my hair. Black men are seen as more intimidating because of the stereotypes we face as well. Hell black people as a whole are disadvantaged when it comes to dating so idk why you feel the need to make it such a point to specifically victimize black women so much. We all understand that it is hard for them. Seeing that okcupid post constantly about how Black women are the least desirable. Unless you're a ""Naomi"",  ""Tyrone"" or whatever else you want to call them, dating interracially is difficult. I know this all too well. 

&gt;Back to you commentator- You can state your preferences without tearing down black women. You say you are not self hating but your words state otherwise. The classic “don’t wear weaves but dont get mad that I’m not attracted to your Afro puffs” narrative is tired and dried up. Uplift to your sisters. You don’t need to date them in order to understand and to celebrate them. That’s what I do for my black brothers even though I have no interest in dating them. 

No where did I tear down black women. In fact, I made it a point to say speak about a type of white women I'm into either. Talking about not being attracted to negative stereotypes isn't tearing someone down, please educate yourself on the difference. And yes, that classic statement is dried up. However, I implied no so such thing. It's just that you felt the need to make it seem like that is how I feel when clearly I did not suggest that. It's like you ignored all of my post entirely and only saw what you wanted to. I'd appreciate it if you discontinued that and take in consideration of others feel instead of trying to satiate your own agenda, which clearly is making me out to seem ignorant, unsupportive, and racially biased against black women. "
556,ed3k2mw,"That guy is still around? IiRC, he posted another about how black girls are ugly to somebody else. Why hasn't anyone reported him to Reddit admin??? "
557,ed6etnh,"&gt; Quite the contrary. Like most people on the hard-left, you don't understand that actions today have consequences tomorrow. If you take people's claimed 'impact' seriously, no matter how dumb and idiotic their arguments, then one incentivizes taking offense at everything. But only for approved classes.


Again, how people receive your words isn't up to you, it's actually up to them (for better or worse). Just think how  you yourself have attributed to mr many opinions I do not have, positions I don't hold, and ideas I don't subscribe to (not that would even know what I think beyond what I've said, and especially not with such poor inductive reasoning on your part), because you think even acknowledging something on ""the left"" as  true and defending that truth value, makes me a ""a leftist"" and thus *I must*  believe whatever (you think) it is ""the left"" believes. 

Like I said, people should toughen up, and people should be less insensitive, just depends on the context  as to which people should do.

 And it to be clear, it is possible to say something that you has an implicit meaning (implication) that you didn't intend and/or are not yourself aware of. Thus it is implicit and the aforementioned implicit meaning can itself be objectively deduced and often is. Like saying to someone ""you look good for a black girl"" would unambiguously imply that the person saying it thinks that black girls are (generally) ugly. It's a clear example of a microagression

 &gt; Which, let's be honest, you are trying to do. You purport to be 'tolerant', while cheering the destruction of someone's life if he disagrees with you. You care about 'microaggressions', while insulting people who disagree with you straight up in a way that is neither 'micro' nor 'unintended'. You pretend to 'not care', while caring very much yourself - it's only people who disagree with you who are supposed to not care that idiots try to silence them.



This is the last of it. The last of how I choose to spend my Thursday morning.....


I don't care about microagressions. I just acknowledge that they're real things. Sometimes I won't say something so as to not to implicitly offend or upset someone. Sometimes I will. That's probably what most people do. Not a big deal. If I think someone is a retard, like that med student, I will call them as such if I am so inclined. If you care about stupid shit, I'm going to take issue (also laugh at it) because people shouldn't care about stupid shit. It makes them worse people and it makes society worse. Microagression and gender neutral language may not matter to me personally but at least they're not predicated on faulty premises and pathological thinking like *your* position (which is really ""oppose the left while maintaining  [a thin veneer of rationality] and health cognitive functions""). If you would simply provide a compelling argument against these ideas and show me why they aren't true rather than skirting around doing so, I may change my mind and think they're untrue (and thus stupid shit to care about).


&gt; I mean, I could not have created a more ridiculous caricature of someone on the hard-left than this. The hypocrisy is staggering, probably because your actual aims are too socially unacceptable to present.

........


&gt; I mean, I could not have created a more ridiculous caricature of someone on the hard-left than this. 

......I want you to know, I worked my way down your post. This is the very last thing I read after I typed everything else....you just proved my point. I honestly feel vindicated here.

This whole time, you thought were arguing with ""the left"" didn't you? That's why you attributed things I didn't say or even indicate to me.

The irony here is staggering. You literally created a caricature of the left, yet were self aware enough to say:

&gt; I mean, I could not have created a more ridiculous caricature of someone on the hard-left than this. 

Yet not self aware enough to realize that, *that is exactly what you did*.

How do you even exist? I dare you to go back and quote where I said for example, ""that I support political correctness"" or ""that I am a progressive"", or even indicated pretty much any of the positions you think I hold.

I mean, I just **nutted** at the irony of all this but still, imagine yourself in my shoes. Imagine having to argue with someone who isn't even arguing with you but some idea of ""the left"" in their head. Imagine that they didn't even perform any good inductive reasoning (indicated by their clear lack of nuance) to even have good reason to attribute these things to you...ok are done imagining it? How many braincels did you lose?

Also, I await your actual arguments against microagressions, gender neutral language (I want to know why they're bad and dont exist. And yes i will point out any shit arguments I see) and your defense of this med student and why this is a free speech issue and not a professionalism one. Maybe you can ask 4chan like this guy  (such a professional amirite?) to crowdsource some"
558,ed7u7vf,I don't think OP meant that white guys think black girls are ugly. More so that they *prefer* other races to black woman.
559,ea975ay,"I agree with this completely. I’m a white teenage boy who’s not attracted to black women but it’s my sexual preference, I don’t regard people that are black as inferior to me or anything like that. I also think op might be misinterpreting what they’re saying, I think it’s more “oh she’s pretty for someone outside of my sexual preference” rather than “she’s pretty for a black girl, because most black girls are ugly”.




Although I might be misinterpreting what they’re saying and they may be racist. I don’t know I wasn’t there"

564,e8hlnbm,Sometimes that isn’t bad because some dude like it thick. HOWEVER most of the fat black girls are either naturally fucking ugly or they take care of themselves so poorly that they’re just fucking unattractive even for a person who is into thick black women.
565,e8ygna6,"I'm a college student and I see a lot of black women and men sporting afros. Since I was a girl, my nmom had full control over hair. My hair was always short because she would misuse the relaxer kits she would get at Walmart. At 19, I decided to take care of my own hair, which she didn't like. Some black girls are fortunate enough to have mothers that teach them to love their hair no matter how it looks. However, there are more incidents of black moms not wanting their daughters to go out in public with their natural hair. For those who aren't narcissists, they do this either because a) they fear that their daughters won't look ""employable"", b) they fear that society (a.k.a white people) won't accept their natural hair or c) both.

In my nmom's case, she truly believe that I'm ugly. Even when I had relaxed hair and it was styled the way she wanted, she would make negative comments about other parts of my body. "
566,e92gi9c,"Serena Williams is only unattractive due to looking so masculine. 
I’m pretty confident you’re making generalizations based on your own opinion lol. 

And can speak for myself and many others in saying black women can either be ugly or attractive just like whites and other races, though I understand others will disagree, you’re speaking like it’s a fact. I’ve had lots of white friends who shared the same view as me too, and from what I’ve read from others whenever this sort of topic was mentioned most also agreed. 

You’re also making it sound like black girls are usually ugly and are required to “work at it” or they’re unattractive based on race alone. Which seems to be making the assertion through race alone they are biologically seen as unattractive until whatever “working at it” is done otherwise they’re ugly and no white guy will touch them except the “particular type” 

Those examples are not examples of race being related, you could say the exact same for two attractive white girls and one not so attractive white girl. There’s no connection to race there my guy. "
567,e9p74w7,"It's all in the wording. I, personally, am attracted to black girls (among other ethnicities, but in general I really like dark  and caramel skin tones) but I've had people say to me outright that ""black girls are ugly"". Not that they're not attracted to them, not that they don't find many that good looking, just a blanket term that ""black girls are ugly"" - I'd call that a fairly racist generalisation.

In any case - all the more for me!

&amp;#x200B;

Just for the record, I'm white and I honestly don't find myself attracted to white girls. That's not to say I can't appreciate a hot / fit / beautiful white girl when I see one, I just don't gravitate toward them like I do others...

568,e7gtzlw,"&gt; Because daughters don’t know how a man is supposed to act, the fatherless see men as disposable wallets once they’re older.

That's part of the issue. The other part of the issue imho as a black man is the fact that most American black girls are raised hearing from their mothers, either verbally or non-verbally, that ""men ain't shit."" Those girls carry that bad attitude about men into adulthood, which is partly why black women are pains in the ass to date. The smart ones can hide their man-hating attitude for a while--especially the ones who try to date interracially--but it rears its ugly head eventually. Since Meghan Markle's mother is a black American, I suspect Prince Harry is in for a nasty shock as the years go by and Meghan reveals her hidden monster.

I for one gave up on American black women years ago. I only date black immigrants or interracially. Unlike with you, Chinese women aren't much of an option for me. Though I admire their work ethic and culture, I tend to not be physically attracted to Asian women. Not enough T&amp;A, except for the rare fat ones."

573,e4dyed9,"I wonder whether people actually think about what they are saying when they make such comments. As if one should be impressed by being told that black girls are ugly, but you're somehow the exception."
574,e1ckq6t,"Pax1,

I had some time to reflect on our discussion, as your reactions to my discussion points were not as intended.  Considering you are a fellow American American, i feel that i failed to effectively get my point across- and potentially alienated an ally - which was not my initial intent. This is really long, but I hope you read until the end, especially the reverse situation scenario. I have tried to avoid being condescending.  The intent is not to bully here. 

From the post history, your main points were:

*1) In american media, Asian men (when given the rare opportunity) often date white women.  So why are are Asian men getting upset that Asian women date non-Asians in media?*

*2) This is just a teen movie - who cares who is dating who?*

*3) Why can't Asian American men just be happy about an Asian american lead?  Why must we complain?*  


I've summarized my thoughts here:

**1)** This is true, in Western shows, Asian men who are given romantic roles often date non-Asians.  However, instances of this happening are far less then with Asian women.  While I do not have data controlling for budget and role size, I can say that in general, Asian women are almost always portrayed as attractive/desirable, capable, yet often the object of conquest for the main character.  This is NOT the same for Asian men - they are often portrayed as weak, nerdy, or some lame stereo type.  Rarely are they even considered for romantic roles. This is damaging. Using ATBIL as an example:  Asian girls, white guys, black guys, latino-ish guys are portrayed as romantically viable - Asian boys?  Nope, ask him to do your math HW!  There are some systematic racist overtones to that.  

**2)** The target demographic actually is a very important audience in the context of this issue.  I think we can both agree that the media can influence social norms -  the type of people and the social situations that they are depicted in does have an influence on how ""attractiveness"" is defined in IRL.  We see all these attractive Asian women who are available to everyone - yet Asian men do not often get this benefit in shows.   You may disagree here - by I contend omission of Asian guys in ATBIL sends a strong message to young women and young Asian men during their most formative years:  Asian boys are invisible - never seen as attractive, even by their own ethnicity.  I understand there is source material - but in this multicultural era - again it seems like a systemic snub to exclude asian guys just because. If asian men are not depicted as attractive, this will negatively affect how they are perceived in real life.

**3)** I still contend that Asian men can point out imbalance of exposure while still fully supporting Asian women with their success.  I don't agree with the sentiment that Asian men should just shut up and be happy for Asian women in the media - honestly that sounds like some old school Uncle Tom shit.  Its basically saying that our views don't matter; which is shocking because Asian women are supposed to be our sisters in arms against overall racist treatment White people have historically thrown at us. The disparity is real to us, even if it doesn't affect you.  Again, I think Asian American men would supportive of what Asian women perceive as unfair or racist - its not our place to minimize or deflect.  

**Here is a reverse situation:**  Imagine if the majority of Asian women who appeared in the media were (almost always) portrayed as undesirable (i'm going to list some arbitrary standards, i'm not trying to define what is attractive).  What if Asian women were always portrayed as overweight, ugly, unkempt, and for some reason - were known to have large gross vaginas (like its a constant joke that Asian women have gross lady parts)   Conversely - Asian men are frequently depicted as the action hero, charismatic, handsome, and always the object of desire of all the women in the show.  In this hypothetical, IRL, this translates to Asian women getting getting much less attention than their peers -  instead of white guys falling over themselves to bag an ""Asian"" they are now met with disdain - ""Ugh, I don't date asian girls.. they are just so lame and nerdy""  

So then Asian women look to Asian men, the one group who you would think would be in to them - nope, many Asian guys are saying ""ew, I don't like Asian girls - they have big vaginas - black girls are where its at!""    And then you notice that Asian men are out marrying 10:1 compared to asian women - literally running away from, in to the arms of white girls who saw some hot Asian guys in some movies and think they are easy.   Asian women start to think to themselves:  ""What the fuck did I do to deserve this treatment - even from my own people, the one group that should be able to understand my perspective""   And imagine trying to talk about this uneven representation that you feel has real life consequences - and Asian men in general say : ""Nah fuck you, you have equal representation, its not our fault everyone thinks you're lame and have big vaginas; now hold my beer while i go jump in to this sea of white girls trying to get at me because they think I'm easy and are great in bed, according to all shows they've seen.”

^Hopefully you can now see how frustrating it would be for you if you were in our shoes.  Thanks for reading, don't feel that you are obligated to re-engage in conversation, I just wanted to say my peace, Asian to Asian."

He's not a bad man at all but he does have this one flaw about him that really bothers me and when I sit down and try to a discuss to him about it it's like pulling teeth it never gets anywhere. Before he met me he has always dated white, Asian, or racially ambiguous females who were light.

 When we got together I noticed that he would always have something to say about how dark my skin tone is because I'm brown, how big my nose is and sometimes my hair. At first I tried to ignore it but the more I had let it slide the more it kept happening and it was really affecting my self-esteem badly so I tried to talk to him about it. 

His friends (who are also African American who happens to only date out of their race) would sit there like it's nothing and constantly disrespect black women mainly the dark skinned ones right in front of me and it's just saddening to watch. 

He would always look at those type of girls walking down the street especially if they dress skimpy and it would suck because I would spend hours doing my hair and makeup to looks nice for him and I stay in shape but I would Start to feel like I wasn't attractive at all to him. Overtime things had gotten a little better and I had  forgave  him for all of the things that he has said and after a LOT of conversations but I noticed that ever since I heard those thing even though I had forgave him, I haven't been as confident in myself and I would feel ugly and talk bad about myself.

I would cry alot and would never want to leave the house. It reminded me alot of my childhood growing up and my teens years in school listening to a bunch of African American boys talking about how ugly black girls  are. Even the boys and men in my family would talk like that and it's sad because even though in the past I've dated outside of my race I have always had a deep love and attraction for black men and would never bash them. Idk I guess I just still have  an open wound that never healed because it was cut too deep."

I think I could probably craft at least one situation where “I date such and such” is a valid defense.

But then if the first guy responded by saying “I said ‘most’. I totally think there are exceptions and in fact I’m dating a black girl right now” I think that might be relevant to this specific situation. "

599,ds8oo5f,"This is true. But I would argue especially in the ""I'm not into black girls"" thing there's a lot (A LOT) of cultural baggage attached. I've rarely met a white guy who is like ""Yeah I'm just blanket-not-attracted to Asian girls"" who we are taught are agreeable, submissive and exotic. Meanwhile black girls are definitely not portrayed this way. They are portrayed as loud, rude, animalistic, and the worst one...dirty. And this shit starts so young and hurts every single person. Video after video exists of black little girls preferring the light skinned dolls over dark skinned dolls because dark is 'ugly'. I've had a 10 year old white child I was tutoring once tell me, ""Oh so it was loud like black women are loud?"" - I don't think he ever met a black woman. 

I mean I used to live in Uganda and I had local Ugandan shop owners that confused me for other white women, or thought a white woman was automatically my friend or sister. All races absolutely do that. But especially in American cultures the history of making the black woman out as a loud, brash, bossy, bitch is really common. And note: Latinas are also portrayed this way. Except because they are generally light skinned - we call them fiery and make it part of their appeal. "

I also see men and women saying that virgins and inexperienced women tend to cheat more in marriages and long-term/serious relationships, so for this reason alone decent men will refuse to date them. I've seen people say that men prefer to date highly experienced women, and that only jerks/macho men would consider dating a virgin. 
&gt;
Yeah me too man I'm also a virgin and it kind of hurts seeing all the subreddits on the front page all the time designed to make fun of people who are clearly bad at relationships for trying. It seems like incel is the new word to put us down :(

As a guy though I think the vast majority of dude's think girls who are virgins are hot taking a girls virginity is probably the hottest thing I can think of this one girl I like was talking about being a virgin and if anything it made her sexier because now I'd really like to take her virginity (not that I have a chance lmao). I think to explain it the trust and power a girl would give you by literally opening up for you and letting you penetrate her for the first time sounds like the best fucking thing ever.

&gt;On top of all my other issues, I am ugly, have never had a job, don't drive/own a car, I don't have a college degree, I live with my mother and father, I have depression and social anxiety, and I'm black, and most men hate black women. I plan on getting a job, learning how to drive, and re-enrolling into college within this year, and I'd like to weigh 125 pounds (I'm currently 5'7""ish and 170 pounds) within 18 months.

&gt;I feel like the only way I could attract men is if I get tons of plastic surgery and learn to become very energetic, bubbly, and snarky.

I would advise not to do either of these plastic surgery is fake looking and gross losing weight will make your face look much better by itself!

You seem to lack understanding of a simple concept. Other black people’s experiences with race arent always going to be the same as mine. Just because your friends haven’t expeneiced racism a lot doesn’t mean that I haven’t. 



I can name a number of factors that may result in why I may experience racism more. E..g I’m a black female that dates white males as opposed to it being the other way around. The shit I have white guys say to me all the time which they don’t understand what’s wrong with it. 

I’ve worked in a very white and male dominated industry and went to a very white male dominated course. 

I’ve gone to extremely white schools. 

Some black people don’t care about certain things. For example Like black men are less likely to care about being fetishised for their big black cocks and they won’t care if their white gf says “I love black men but black girls are so ugly and they’re always as jealous of me because I take their men” 


I tend to be quiet and appear very open minded. I never talked about race issues with other people. Just my black firends and my white boyfriend. That’s it. People think they can say all manner of shit to me all the time.] because I just nod and smile. 


You also equate many racist experiences as if I can’t have good experiences with people of different races. I have good expensive all the time. I’m not counting this as a completion. One good expernice doesn’t negate a bad racist experience. Same as a bad experience i have  doesn’t negate a good experience. 


You also maybe only believe that only out and out racism is racism. That things like constantly talking to me in Ebonics. Constantly being a bit more less helpful than me etc etc. Parents refusin to let their kids play with my little sister. Subtle things arent racism. I’m sure there’s shit I overlooked and don’t remember. 


Please don’t get defensive. I’m trying to explain as best as I can. If you aren’t in a situation it isn’t always to see things. And finally I’m not saying I’ve had more bad racist experiences than good ones but those two don’t cancel each other out.

605,dqw05fe,"Most ridiculous: ""I understand why your ex left you. You're clingy and crazy. You come off like a stalker."" - ""friend"" said literally a week after my ex dumped me after a two and a half year relationship. Looking back, it's really funny now because he tried to take advantage of my vulnerability and got pissed when that didn't work.

Funniest: ""Are you sure you're Black because Black girls are ugly. You must be Brazilian or something."""
606,drer2ri,"Yeah I'll just stop commenting lol. I type how I talk and text doesn't properly convey my point the way talking would. Look, I wasn't calling all tall girls hideous creatures, I was saying that me preferring shorter girls isn't height shaming,now me hating all tall girls would be me height shaming. Similar to my race point, preferring white girls isn't racist, but thinking all black girls are inherently ugly is racist. "
607,dosfm6e,"He needs therapy for his insecurity. You can't fix that. He can't fix it on his own. But that insecurity doesn't excuse this: 

&gt; ut then he started talking about how his exs were trashy and ugly and saying that whenever he was with them he was always worried about looking like a ghetto guy. I asked him why he thought his exs were trashy and ugly and he said most black girls are like that and that white girls are so much better both in personality and looks. 

This is shitty and racist and I would think twice about being with a guy like that. But that's just me. So he dated black women while simultaneously having no respect for them and finding them ""trashy""? I think that says more about him than it does about the women he dated. I would want to be sure he's not dating you solely because you're the ""right"" color/he's fetishizing you as much as he says he doesn't want to be fetishized. "
608,doxxak5,god damn black girls are ugly
609,dp5o374,"This seems to be a peculiarity of how you as an individual communicate. I think that _most_ people use the phrase ""not into"" to mean that they do not like the thing. Or if they were going to use it in the way you mentioned re: pork chops, they would say ""I'm not into pork chops _tonight_."" But a blanket statement of ""I'm not into pork chops"" would be interpreted by most people to mean that you don't like them at all.

It all comes down to which of the following better describes your view in the OP:

1. Saying ""I'm not into black girls"" NEVER means that you think all black girls are ugly; or

2. Saying ""I'm not into black girls"" only SOMETIMES means that you think all black girls are ugly.

Your view as described seems to be closer to #1, which just doesn't reflect the reality of how most people use the phrase ""not into."""
610,dp6e76r,"Practically speaking, those statements seem identical without any context. The speaker has to expand on that because my immediate interpretation of ""I'm not into X"" is something like ""on a scale of 1 to 10, I find X to be a 3."" Meaning, in order to do X, some other good things need to cancel out the dislike for X. And that if they end up doing X, it's in SPITE of X and not BECAUSE of X. Like if someone said ""I'm not into short hair"" I'd interpret that as ""I don't like short hair, but I might like all the other parts of that person (face/personality/body/etc) and that's good enough.""

Now, there can certainly social contexts that affect that statement. For example, if a man says ""I'm not into dudes"" most will interpret that as meaning ""I find men unattractive as a group"" and not with the same gravity as a hair preference.

That being said, in the case of the post you referenced, it is true that there could be racial contexts. Not saying there is in this particular case, but I would make the assumption that there is. Black girls are often thought of as the most unattractive women as a group, they have all sorts of negative stereotypes, and they have the hardest time dating because of it. So it's easy to read into the statement ""I'm not into black girls"" as meaning ""I deem black girls to be ugly/obnoxious/loud/etc"" all the stereotypes attached to them--and also for those connotations to either feed into fetishizing black girls or to affect dating preferences in a way that betrays his innate physical attraction to them. I know it's very armchair psych, but this sort of thing is common for fetishes. It's like men who watch fat chick porn but won't date fat chicks, or racists who watch black dude/white woman cuckold porn, chauvinists who get off to forced feminization, feminists with rape fetishes, etc...

African Americans from African immigrant families have very dark skin and are physically/objectively ugly to me, no racial, but there is something about them that gets me emotionally drawn to them and wanting to wife them. They're well mannered like someone else said and they generally aren't as basic as other girls. I can almost instantly tell when a black American girl is from an African immigrant family through her speech and clothes.         "
614,dneg9bu,"""They're physically unattractive on a universal standard, not just on a western standard.""

What??! Where in the world did you get that idea? Not true at all. Clearly you are extremely misguided and delusional, so I'll have to make a more in depth post about this and cite multiple studies to show you that a) Black women are NOT considered universally unattractive... That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard 
b) You are completely in denial about what women don't find attractive about Asian men. We have been stereotyped as short, soft, yellow foreigners with tiny penises. One of the most pervasive myths about Asian men centers around penises. Racism itself is based on the belief that one group of people is inferior based upon how they LOOK - and you're telling me this doesn't have anything to do with appearance? Get out of here. 

I'm more than willing to actually use data, well documented history, and academic studies to back up my point and I suggest you do the same. I'm more than prepared to have a real debate about this, so I suggest you start gathering the same if you want to defend what your saying from a scientific and historical basis. 

Spoiler Alert: You won't be able to. 

Btw - just for kicks.... These women are all dark skinned black girls. Are you going to tell me these women are considered universally unattractive??

Not to mention, there are gorgeous dark skinned black women who have won Miss Universe, which is chosen by male and female judges of every race from all over the world...

Also, I dare you to name more universally renown Asian male supermodels than black female supermodels that are known around the world. Here's a list of some of the most prominent female supermodels: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_black_fashion_models. So, who are they? INTERNATIONALLY RENOWN. I'll wait. 


Here's a thread where a racist white guy posed as a random black woman and received over 90 messages from thirsty guys of all races in one hour. And yes, she was dark skinned. Check it out for yourself: https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=144540941
Where's the Asian male equivalent? Again... I'll wait. 


If black women are so unattractive, why was the first person of color ever on the Bachelor series, man or woman,  a black woman? Why is she engaged to a white man? Why did all of the Asian men and hapas get eliminated on night one? Why was a prominent white male podcast for millennials calling the Asian and hapa males ugly (Grandex/Postgrad Problems), and mocking them, while posting pics of hot black girls on their TFM Babe of the Day instagram pages?


Miss USA both this year and last year were black. This year, FIVE of the top ten finalists were black. There was also a dark skinned Indian, making 6 out of 10 of the finalists dark skinned females. A dark skinned half black woman was miss Japan a few years ago. Again, what's the Asian male equivalent? There is none. 


Contrast this with how Asian men are viewed in American society. If the way Asian men are perceived has nothing to do with physical stereotypes, why is ""Asian penis"" an insult now used among millennials? Why is this the top voted definition of ""Asian penis"" on Urban Dictionary? : https://i.imgur.com/dL3yWJ8.png Asian men are perceived as being at the bottom of the totem pole physically, and women will always have higher sexual market value than men. This includes black women.

Neither is saying most black girls are ugly. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Your beauty, or someone else's, isn't determined by people on Reddit. If that's how you feel, than that's how you feel. Being racist can have nothing to do with feeling that way. I think most people that i have met are not attractive. Im sure most people feel that way, unless they are really really ugly. That's fine. A real woman doesn't care if some dude online thinks she is masculine or too masculine. Women who are comfortable with their bodies are called masculine all the time, because that is a trait most commonly associated with men. Its a shame that its that way, and its a shame that being ""masculine"" = ugly. There are women who purposely try to be more masculine all the time. Ever heard of a butch? Or a butch dyke? Nothing wrong with being masculine, like there is nothing wrong with being black, or gay, or having hair on your nipples. Your personal preferences on who you find attractive does not determine whether or not you are racist. Saying Michelle looks like a man isn't racist. I've seen men who look like women. Im sure everyone here has, and many of us couldn't even tell the difference sometimes. Having opinions, especially differing ones, is a good thing.

Thinking back on the cyclical nature of body trends for American women, I don’t have a complete internal archive to draw from that would help me Jerry-rig an algorithm real quick to help us predict what’s coming next more precisely, but I would agree with your observation that it seems that thinness is a default that we return to. Indeed in the couture world, it never goes out of style at all and is always the only acceptable aesthetic. 

Off of the top of my head, in the 20’s girls were flappers and not only thin but would also bind their breasts. Then the curvy pin-up girl look became popular, like Jane Mansfield, but their were always girls like Vivian Leigh, who played Scarlett O’Hara in Gone With the Wind who was an overwhelmingly popular template and had a 24 inch waist in that movie. Audrey Hepburn circa Breakfast at Tiffany’s looked the same. (I’m not listing the decades consecutively here, sorry. It would help if I was and it would help if I was measuring the time in between each look becoming the standard, and then being replaced.)

But Marilyn Monroe really took over the global imagination the way Nicki Minaj did and she was very curvy, albeit in this incredibly unattainable way and to this day I am unclear about the extent to which her body was natural. I *think* it was all natural because before she was Marilyn and still Norma Jean Baker in an orphanage, her body looked the same so she was probably just a genetic outlier but I’m not 100% sure. If someone is I’d love to know. (I know her nose was fake and her hairline was redesigned through early electrolysis). 

When Mad Men hit and everybody got a look at Christina Hendricks,  I thought for sure that exact aesthetic would become the standard again. Her proportions were just like Marilyn Monroes. Though if you look up early Christina Hendricks picks you’ll see it’s likely that her breasts are fake (who cares they are spectacular) but she doesn’t have a fake ass or thighs at all. I wish that look had really taken hold because she’s far from thin with a real ass, and it would have been good for a lot of young girls I think, even though she looks like an outlier too and part of her look is surgically achieved. 

Like you, I wouldn’t be surprised if ultra thin is going to make a comeback in the white community in the next 10 years or so, but not until Kim ages out of being a sex symbol. She’s got this on lock for the rest of her young life. 

In the black community, though we’ve been less visible so people didn’t know, thick girls have always been considered preferable for as long as I can remember (not the ones allowed to be in movies, the girls IRL) and I’m not sure the general population is aware (they may be) that if you go into a hip-hop club in NY on any given night fully 50% of the girls have their bodies done like Nicki. 

They basically have Groupon type things to fly to the Dominican Republic to get your body done and it doesn’t look like black girls are looking to give this up anytime soon in the same way that white girls never gave up breast implants. It could be here to stay in black world. So I disagree with you there that people are going to tire of looking at the fake asses. It’s a little weird because IRL it definitely doesn’t look natural from every angle. 

It’s fully become part of the whole “living your best life” with black girls because it just makes them feel so hyper-sexy and it’s the optimization of a type of African look that has always been idolized by black guys the whole time white guys would only consider skinny white girls. 

I feel like white guys in general, imho, just love that skinny stuff so much that there’s a huge part of their demographic that drags Kim and calls  her diaper butt and stuff even though she looks amazing (though not natural) but black guys would go as far as to carve out their own kidney just for a chance to stand in the same room as her or Nicki. I don’t think Nicki and Kim’s look is going anywhere in the black community anytime soon, but yeah, white girls will be pressured to be skinny again soon probably. 

My personal preference as a black girl is Rihanna’s body. 💯 natural but super fit, yet not with so much definition as to compromise that ultra-feminine appeal she has. I love that she rocks her small breasts and real Afrocentric nose and has made that like, a really sexy thing. She’s my fitness idol. Mostly because she just is, and partially because BBL is 💯the most dangerous procedure you can have as there is high risk of it causing blood clots to travel to your lungs and kill you and if you go that route you have to take that risk over and over again for maintenance surgeries for the rest of your life.

So what relevance does that have to today's guns that are designed specifically for sporting purposes? Or licensing, training etc? Nothing, its just to prop up your argument with dramatic effect.

Fact is, you really don't care about gun deaths, you'd be talking about why black boys are killing each other and our vets are killing themselves. Neither of which would be deterred by symbolic feel good controls. Your goal seems more about imposing controls in and of themselves, and the feeling like it gives you a moral high ground."

Now tell me, what are some examples of **systematic racism** that white people experience today? Do explain."
660,ejmssex,"&gt; I don't care about your social psychology links.
Psychology is pseudo-science hence, academic pseudo-intellectualism really does apply here.

Translation: I do not are for well-studied phenomenon. I do not understand statistics, and I do not actually care for facts.

You are an idiot. Moreover, you are a racist piece of shit. If you are truly willing to ignore fact and instead rely on ""feelings"", you are a part of the problem. If the facts tell you otherwise, maybe you should examine the opinions you hold, and ask why you hold those opinions.

If you don't understand the studies, learn statistics. Read the statistics and perform your own statistics. Come up with alternative ways to explain the study, and then refute those to me. Don't just blatantly ignore the facts and say ""those facts aren't real!""

&gt; Yes, it has really held black people back for example, Obama, Neil degrasse tyson, The Williams sisters, Will smith, Morgan Freeman, Ben Carson, Trevor Noah... Oprah.

Translation: Because some successful black people exist, there must be no prejudice.

 Critical thinking may not be your strong suit. Do you know what distribution means are? Do you know the word ""outlier""? Did you know that successful black people can exist, and yet the population of black people can still be more discriminated against on average. These black people are successful DESPITE the barriers holding them back.

Notice how these aren't for the lack of trying. Most of these links prove discrimination DESPITE being on equal level as white people. It is very difficult to get ahead when there's systematic societal discrimination holding us back.

Yes, the black community can also change. Nobody argues against that. In fact, the black community IS TRYING (by events such as these), but you and your klan buddies wants to stop these events under the veil of it being ""racist"". Do you not know how idiotic that sounds?

These ""black-only"" events are created to help those who are underrepresented succeed, yet everyone on this thread wants to tantrum about it. It's difficult to enact change when ignorant idiots are on a mission to stop change whenever they can.

Would you support a Hispanic-only events supporting underrepresented computer scientists? Or a male-only event supporting underrepresented males in nursing? This is the EXACT same thing."
662,ed3h3h1,"&gt; Something more than what we have

This is another reason why you don't get sympathy or cooperation from gun owners, because you just say ""more"", without a complete 360 degree discussion of substantive, results based solutions.

Face it, a registry and licensing will do nothing to prevent someone who has decided they are willing to take their life or commit a felony with a gun. Nothing else matters at that point. 

There are a few more gun control things I think could have an incremental impact.

* Prosecute the people who lie in their form 4473 and are denied the sale, currently they are not prosecuted and are free to ""test the waters"" to see if they fell through the cracks

* Close the background check cracks. There was a church shooting in Texas, and a school shooting in my state, Wa, where the person passed a background check because the military and tribal courts did not submit their mental health and domestic violence restraining order records into the background check system. 


Beyond that, we just have to accept that guns are ubiquitous in our society. There are 300,000,000 in circulation, and ultimately some will be used for crime no matter what we do. Even a full out confiscation (only possible via a registry) and zero new civilian sales would take generations to have an impact. 

We need to be talking about why black boys are killing each other (jobs, education, family, role models etc), why white men kill themselves (military PTSD, jobs), and why white boys shoot up schools (social isolation, mental health, hero worship of previous shooters celebrated by our media). 

Until you have an honest open discussion across all these areas, you can't pretend to own the high ground over gun owners in the ""we need to do SOMETHING"" department. Because right now it only appears that you want a political win by sticking it to gun owners by any means possible, like the gun control proponents in my state."

"
666,e4z3aeo,"Here's a few things that I would expect IF i were looking for a husband (I plan to stay single)

1. Likes to talk. I need a guy who'd like to chat with me throughout the day. Can't stand quiet guys, or even worse, secretive guys. 

2. Wants to be 'the man'. I guess I'm old fashioned, but especially since I'm so independent and strong, if I were to date, I would like to sit back and let him take the lead. If he can't do that, and I have to continue to be the strong one and plan all the dates and such, nevermind.

3. Head in the right place. I don't want a guy who's doing drugs, or sits home playing games all day or lacks common sense. I don't expect a bachelors degree, but at least someone who is building his career, thinking about his future, not doing illegal stuff etc. 

4. Christian. I'm such a strong believer, and I have a strong argument for God (I took evolution and philosophy in the past, but the evidence for God is much stronger imo), that if I constantly have to try to convince him and get him to convert....that was one of the main reasons my only long term relationship ended. It'd be nice if he were willing to wait for a few years or marriage before crossing certain lines as well. 

5. Family must like me. Regarding the same guy, he was asian, and his fam never liked me from the beginning just cause I'm black, had a minimum wage job at the time, and came from a 'ghetto' area. The son clearly loved me, and I did so much for him, but I felt like I wasn't wanted when I came over. The grandparents wouldn't even say hello back to me when they walked in the door. 

6. Have similar interests. I'm a black girl, but I'm not really into things stereotypical black girls are into. I like Japanese music and anime, I like video games (nintendo to be exact), I have such a wide range of interests, and I'd want my guy to either be interested in it too so we can do things we like together, or at least be understanding of it.....but I wouldn't want someone who is extreme either, ie someone who cosplays, or plays video games all the time. 

7. Someone who's serious about me. I don't want to feel like just another girl on the list, nor do I want a guy who wants to date me just to kill time. I don't believe in wasting time with someone if you don't see a future with them. I would hate to be strung along, just for him to dump me out of the blue or cheat on me or whatever. This also means trying, trying to make me happy, showing his love for me, letting me know that he's thinking about me etc etc"

668,dhxv8ip,"&gt;we killed the states' rights debate and embraced federalism in order to free the slaves.

We didn't kill the debate; we (briefly) won it for the side that doesn't believe in fucking owning people.

Reconstruction was not a failure because it was improperly designed; it was a failure because the shitheads opposed to it did their best to sabotage it. See also: every policy that has ever brought our country forward from the dark ages.

As for women in the workplace, do you think that the nuking of the labor force might have more to do with the constant stripping of worker protections through lobbying and legislation by and for the super-rich?

You have some reasonable complaints, such as the one about the National Guard. But in the end, you really are asking for a world in which slaves remain slaves until we can get their freedom juuuuuuuust right. Where if we can't bring in the National Guard, those little black girls are just gonna have to suck it up until FourNominalCents is satisfied with the details.

These are real people. If you don't like the compromises and mistakes we've made in trying to save their lives - and a lot of people don't - go do something to fix them now. It's possible, but like all good things, it's not easy."

670,eb3v8ou,"I have two, and before them I had a white son with a ex hubby. My son was born with a under developed penis and testicles. He had surgery only weeks old to remove Extra skin. It was a circumcision on steroids. The skin around the head had been removed and his testicles are up inside so they removed extra scrotum leaving just a small amount for when he hit puberty. He is sterile but still makes a goo that he leaks when excited or rubbing the lil acorn. He was able to transition and took blockers to halt puberty. Now he lives as a she and is attracted to Black guys too! 

My Black boys are just amazing both play sports and have stright A's. I spoil them rotten and my husband pays 250 bucks a week to each one every other week into a collage fund. They had been great as toddlers and had almost no issues. I had both naturally with my white husband there watching from between my legs. I told the nurses but not the doctor that it was going to be a mixed child and not my husband's. Clearly they are use to it because both nurses told my hubby to be a good father to those special babies😁. The doctor was Black and when he saw he was so happy. He asked my hubby if he would like to cut the cord. I had multiple orgasms durring natural birth it was amazing!

The only issue was breast feeding. I didnt breast feed my first son because I dont believe my body should be feeding a child that was a mistake and didnt want to go threw it as a single mom. But I changed my mind with my last two and did. The problems had been years later. My boys breast fed for way to long but there amazing sexy dad made me do so untill they weeined themselves naturally. I had one stay on me untill he was 7. "

Black boys are 3x more likely to be suspended and expelled than white students, and that is significant because when students are suspended or expelled they are more likely to be in contact with the juvenile justice system in the following year.  Black girls are 6x more likely to be suspended than white girls in school.  This is related to the implicit bias you allude to in your question.  Behaviors of black students are interpreted differently than those same behaviors in white students.  So while talking back to a teacher might be tolerated from a white student,  in a black child, that may be interpreted as a threatening behavior, leading to suspension, or even worse, involving the police. This puts kids on the ""school-to-prison"" pipeline. There is a connection, of course to mental health, because many of the behaviors, for example of ADHD, such as impulse control, can be interpreted quite differently for black compared with white students, leading to suspension/expulsions, and involvement with the juvenile justice system, putting them on the that school to prison pipeline.   -Tumaini Coker-"
673,fwf7c3h,"There’s a huge difference between being equal on paper and being equal in practice.

For example, laws can be set so restrictive that everyone *essentially* breaks them. Imagine a stretch of highway where the speed limit is set at 50mph but everyone drives it at 75mph. At that point, it’s up to the discretion of the law enforcement officer to decide who he’s gonna pull over. If he only ever pulls over black people then that’s *effectively* a racist law. Even though, on paper, the law is supposed to effect everyone, in practice the only ones who are getting ticketed are black people.

My favorite example of structural inequality is bathrooms in stadiums and concert venues. Even though on paper, men and women *might* have access to the same number of bathrooms, this doesn’t take into account of the physical differences (women can’t stand up at urinals, women get periods so bathroom use time takes longer) or cultural differences (women are often the ones who have to take the kids to go pee). So, yes, even though on paper both sexes technically have access to the same number of bathrooms, in practice it’s not fair.

Every time a woman has to wait an hour to use the bathroom, it’s a for real-deal example of structural inequality.

So what does this have to do with being black in America?

Well, if prison populations are swelling because they’re packed with black weed smokers (even though everyone smokes weed) *that’s* a problem.

And if black girls are dropping out of high school because they don’t have access to bathrooms (or bathroom products once a month, i.e. tampons, maxi pads) then that’s a problem because we get this whole group  of undereducated girls, etc."

676,ftafmqo,"The other major explanation that is endorsed my most social scientists is... white supremacy! Black people have been prevented from getting a decent education, buying property, getting business loans, being employed in many fields first legally then informally for decades. That effect compounds over generations and doesn't go away like a flipped light switch.

As you know, since the 1960s, American manufacturing a blue collar work dried up due to large companies moving manufacturing off shore. Due existing white supremacist attitudes, black men were kept out of what little low skill and skilled manual labor was left. An example is Detroit and the automobile industry. Google it if you want want a deep dive. Black men, because of not being taught to read up until the 70s, let alone going to college, and largely being kept out professional jobs for most of thr 20th century, have had a hard time climbing the ladder into other types of jobs. 

Comparatively, black women have fared better in the workforce in this period. Low wage women's work is stuff like maids, nurse assistants, etc. are not off-shored. Black women have had a better record entering college a
In large numbers. I would argue that this is because of the racist ways that young black boys are treated by institutions at an early age (see arguments about school to prison pipeline). 

This kind of EXTREME economic insecurity is really hard on families. And when there is a gender component such that men, who historically have been positioned as providers, are not able to fill that role, it can lead to a real breakdown in the family structure.

I don't necessarily agree with you that single parenthood is the single cause of all the problems facing Black Americans, but I would buy that it's one factor. I would argue that the cause of single parenthood is, at its root, white supremacy both historical and present."

So, against my better judgement, sicne no one's mind has ever been change by a Reddit post,  I want to help you better understand how racism most commonly manifests in a culture where it's no longer socially acceptable to casually drop N-bombs in polite company, or parade through the town square in bedhseets.

You live in a society where a woman who referred to black and brown teens as ""super-predators"" still wins an overall majority of the national vote, where 12 year old black boys are murdered in the street by self-appointed ""neighborhood watchmen"" who then get off scott-free, where white women attempt to discipline black and brown strangers with 911 calls so frequently there's slang for it. The Southern Strategy is a thing. The School-to-Prison-Pipeline is a thing. Stop and Frisk was a thing. And it still would be, if a certain mayor had his way. 

There is quantifiable, systemic racism at the heart of many motivations in American society, and it's a thing we ALL have to unlearn. Pointing at internet comments as ""evidence"" absolves no one of that."

680,fa0nkhr,"For those wondering about what the article is all about, this is an article co-written by Rep Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and it speaks about the school to prison pipeline. Here are some of the statistics that the article discusses over.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Across our country, black and brown girls are pushed out of school not because they pose any sort of threat, but for simply being who they are. Society too often deems [our hair too distracting](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/05/11/black-students-malden-school-who-wear-braids-face-punishment-parents-say/stWDlBSCJhw1zocUWR1QMP/story.html?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) and our [bodies too proactive](https://nwlc-ciw49tixgw5lbab.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/web_Final_nwlc_DressCodeReport-1.pdf), our voices [too loud](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1993/03/31/loud-black-girls-just-wanting-to-be-heard/15b7db23-a69a-450e-b6de-4c9308fbb823/), and our attitudes too mean — demeaning our very existence before we even reach adulthood. According to the [National Women’s Law Center](https://nwlc.org/blog/too-many-black-girls-in-preschool-disciplined-and-pushed-out/), black girls in preschool are 54 percent of the girls receiving out-of-school suspensions despite making up only 20 percent of girls enrolled in preschool. Preschool.

&amp;#x200B;

Truth. Here is an excerpt on it more.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;From kindergarten to 12th grade, black girls are seven times more likely than white girls to be suspended from school, and four times more likely [to be arrested at school](https://static.wixstatic.com/ugd/0c71ee_7d6b6469aa144b0397a4d7cd5d0f8051.pdf). Latinx girls are more than 1.5 times as likely as white girls to receive an out of school suspension, and Native American girls are suspended at three times [the rate of white girls](https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/final_nwlc_Gates_GirlsofColor.pdf). When we unfairly discipline our girls, we rob them of their childhood by treating them as if they need less protection, nurturing, and comfort than other children. We fail to see their humanity and we fail to respond to the adverse childhood experiences that so many of us experience in our youth.

&amp;#x200B;

Pressley is advocating for a new bill called the Ending Pushout Act. Her bill in detail speaks about the fact of curbing the rates of children of color getting suspended more often and keeping kids in school, because of the fact that 88% of inmates in prison were high-school dropouts, if I am correct. As someone who works in education, this is a key and crucial factor for schools today. It's a major conversation piece for the education department in the U.S. It's huge. Having Ayanna's bill getting traction is a good step, I believe.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Ending PUSHOUT Act is the first of many bills stemming from Representative Pressley’s [People’s Justice Guarantee](https://pressley.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-pressley-launches-bold-progressive-criminal-legal-reform-resolution-people) — a bold, progressive resolution outlining a new vision for the American legal system that makes good on the promise of justice for all. Achieving this vision requires all of us to dismantle the systems of oppression and control that have unfairly policed and criminalized marginalized communities for generations. The Ending PUSHOUT Act does just that, centering the experiences of young girls of color and keeping them out of the criminal legal system and in the classroom where they can learn, thrive, and develop the skills necessary to achieve their dreams.

&amp;#x200B;

So, there we go."
681,fa0qg5k,"Well, I mentioned it in my comment. The school to prison pipeline is real, and it's ever present for students in Title I schools, which is where I work now.

684,ezum187,"Usual conservative hit piece on public schools.  There are also hints of the meta narrative about black people to boot.    

**Government schools are getting lots of money, but failing**  

As a yellow journalist, Stossel is a master of saying things without saying them, drawing on ideas and themes without identifying them.  

**Articulate black woman who happens to be a Muslim wants a school without fighting for her children**  

So he invokes here the ""Dangerous Minds""/""The substitute""/""Stand and
Deliver""/""Lean on Me"" trope.  

What we need in these urban hellholes is a strong man to bring these children to heel.  

**Can't shop around for schools**   

I can't shop around for the police, firemen, or any other govt workers either.  

He frames going to school as if it were some normal good.   

WHY SHOULDN'T I HAVE CHOICE!!   

**Stuck with the school that the government assigns them**  

**A charter school is funded with tax payer money but run like a private school**   

The implication is that private schools are better.  That is why rich people send their kids there...and why those rich parents have to build dormitories so little Thomas Williamson the IV can get in with his mediocre grades.  

John doesn't define better. By leaving that up to the viewer's imagination, he doesn't need to talk hard numbers.  

**Charter schools try new ideas**   

Implies that public schools do not.   Notice that Stossel uses government schools in place of public schools.  It's a rhetorical trick.  

**Public schools don't like competition from charter schools**   

He didn't go into why here, he lets the question linger.  Great manipulation technique.   

**Charters are often better**   

No stats here, no reason, no explanation.  

Anyone that can do a simple Google search will know how mixed this record is.  

**Parents line up to sign up to school lotteries**   

Low key, for the few seconds on tv, most (not all) of the parents are women.  The meta narrative of the single black mom, no dad in sight, continues.  John isn't pushing this point, but he is hitting all the dog whistles.  

Camera stays on ecstatic black women and children, and pans to those in despair.  Great drama.  

Gone is the idea that a quality education is something we all deserve.  

**Hardy then starts in on rules**  

Black conservatives and white ones love the idea that black men just need a lot of rules.  

The reality is that the tough love approach doesn't address actual problems. If it did, prison and the police state would have fixed America and China a long time ago.   

**If I can tell you to tuck in your shirt**  

As if most teachers are just cowering in the corner, and don't tell kids to pull up their pants, be quiet, and do their homework.  

**With the boys in this take no bs school, they quickly changed. They know listen to her**   

Emphasis on quick.  Meta narrative that black boys are out of control.   Now they read!!   

**Reading was a punishment**   

The blacks don't like studying narrative continues.  

**Late night phone calls to teachers was wrong**   

There is a lot in this scene, but remember all the parents lined up to get their kids into the school..   How much do parents who are not educators know about schools and what their children learn and should learn?  

**Why Latin**   

Because it's hard!  And we want them to get used to doing hard things.   

This is subtle, but schools are more than memorizing facts and figures.  I'll get back to this point, but KIPP schools also emphasize this.   

Latin isn't as hard as Chinese or as practical as Spanish.  Latin is the language of the classics, basis of Western Civilization.   

Its rather interesting that some Philly Muslim kids are learning this, but I'll save my Hotep musings for a different post.  

**Stossel gets more conservative talking points out of Hardy including that they send more black kids to college**  

No foundation for this, no evidence.  

**Hardy - the public schools never tell you what's wrong with the kid.  **   

Again this is a universal problem framed as a public school problem.  

**I pay taxes, I should choose where it goes**  

Conservative talking point, black mouth piece.  

**A whole lot less union jobs**  

Conservative talking point, black mouth piece.  

**Bad charters close, bad schools are permanent**  

Nope, bad charters are hard to close, and public schools go close (often because of charters pulling enough students away)  

You guys get the gist.  

Not a bad piece of propaganda.  But still propaganda"
685,eryvu0f,"&gt;What, another one? You think there aren't enough Klan rallies?

1. There are very few KKK parades in the world and both sides denounce them (including Trump).
2. A white pride parade wouldn't be a KKK parade, it would be a parade that celebrates everything white people gave you. From the computer you are using to about 90% of everything you love. If you are using it, there's a very high chance it was made by a white person.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  Yes, it very much does.

No, it really doesn't. Please show me the homicide rate for gay people. I really looked and could find nothing. For everyone one story you show, there are thousands of stories of black people being killed by black people. Wouldn't it be a better use of our time if we focused on the black nuclear family? 74% of black children are raised without a dad. President Obama said this is the number one issue facing black folks. Without a dad, young black boys are way more likely to not finish high school, commit crimes, and end up in prison.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Not really, given that your premise of ""Gay Pride Parades are mainly celebrated in the United States"" is entirely wrong and again, based entirely on the fact that - again - you're looking at your immediate locality and thinking that you're looking at the entire planet. 

That wasn't my point. My point is that gay pride parades are done in countries where it doesn't matter. Who cares if it's done in Sao Paolo. What does it accomplish? They aren't being persecuted there. They are being persecuted in Muslim countries. Go to Iran and have a gay pride parade. Then I will support it. Why aren't you attacking Muslim countries on their persecution of gays? They stone gays. They throw them off buildings. Go attack them. Don't attack Western culture that has done more for gays than any other culture in the history of man."

687,ehcipo3,"The Promise Program and how it is enacted by school administrators seems to vary somewhat from school to school. It is accompanied by general guidelines and norms that administrators, school resource officers, and others are expected to abide by. We all saw the extent to which Obama's ""Dear Colleague"" letter regarding Title IX did for college campuses--propping up Kangaroo courts and persecuting students accused of sexual misconduct without due process. The ""Dear Colleague"" letter he wrote in regards to the ""school to prison pipeline problem"" has been taken to an extreme as well--above and beyond official stated school policy much of the time:       
       
""At issue is a ""Dear Colleague"" letter and guidance from the previous administration, issued in 2014, which aimed to stem the school-to-prison pipeline by prodding schools to reduce the number of suspensions and expulsions, especially for students of color and students with disabilities, both of whom receive disciplinary actions at disproportionately high rates.

According to the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, among the 2.6 million students suspended each year, black boys are three times more like than white boys to be suspended, black girls are six times more likely than white girls to be suspended, and students with disabilities are more than twice as likely as their peers to be suspended.

Broward County Public Schools in Florida, the sixth-largest school system in the country and home to Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where last month's school shooting took place, was one of the first to embrace what's known as ""restorative justice"" discipline programs and quickly became one of the Obama administration's darlings for its efforts to focus on equity in discipline.         
               
In fact, the superintendent of the Broward school, Robert Runcie, who worked alongside former Education Secretary Arne Duncan in the Chicago Public Schools, was the leading force behind instituting new practices within the district for handling student behavior issues without resorting to law enforcement involvement, which quickly became a national model for ending zero-tolerance policies in schools.

Student-related arrests, Runcie's bio shows, are down by 65 percent since he came to Broward County.""

You don't reduce convictions by that much in such a short period of time without taking drastic measures. And I can guarantee you that not all of the kids who would have been charged but weren't, were officially admitted into the Promise Program. There are set guidelines and rules school staff are expected to follow in the event of an incident where a student commits a crime. You don't write down a lot of those guidelines out of fear that they might get leaked or open up the school to a lawsuit. "

I also loved the imagery — both boys looked like Jesus with their arms on the cross. In real life, black boys are most at risk for being sacrificed to violence and prison so it made sense that Jason was particularly vulnerable and watched over by Adelaide."

you are not very good with the whole... reading thing. Hell, you quoted me and everything (although I did made it *stand out*, which didn't pass the quote itself..). I wrote that I do believe it to be a an issue - a big one at that - but I don't see how it would be the difference from white kids born 1 out of 4 out of wedlock, to black kids 3 out of 4. 

Suggesting almost every black father out there gets incarcerated between impregnating his girlfriend and his kid born is, honestly, racist as hell (you use it to account to the difference from whites - so 50% of Black fathers, by your account, get to prison in those 9 months...). 

Truth is, even in the the year 1988 - let alone 2018 - pregnancies could be controlled. Granted, access to birth control in the US could be better and is halted by dumb ignorance... but those Asian girls (13% born out of wedlock) and White girls (25%) still manage to get it together. The vast majority of them had a baby when they were already engaged or married to begin with - and allowed for it. This is indeed a cultural issue - One where black girls are willing - from ignorance or choice - to get pregnant before marriage. Mass incarceration has very little to do **with this specific thing** (here, made it bold to help you with the reading thingie!)"
690,eaecn4t,"The lower ranks of the US military are disproportionately made up of POC. It's part of why Trump was trying to block military overseas votes in Florida.

With that in mind, consider that the US as an institution keeps POC disenfranchised and impoverished, making military service not only an appealing option to not die hungry in the street, but sometimes the only option to not die hungry in the street. Also, all of the instances where 17-year-old black boys are given the option to go to prison for five years over a blunt, or military service.

So, we've got the whole US political machine forcing POC into impossible situations, and then the 16-25 woke white male gamer Chapo demographic says, ""fuck all the troops.""

691,ebt2vqn,"&gt; The Obama-era guidelines were meant to dismantle, at least in part, the school-to-prison pipeline, the nationwide phenomenon in which students are punished for offenses as variant as wearing the wrong color hoodie, to getting in fistfights, and are then funneled into the juvenile and criminal justice system. Black children—particularly black boys—are disproportionately affected. As Laura Waters blogs for Education Post, despite making up just 15 percent of all students, black boys represent more than a third of all students who have been suspended once. That rate leaps up to 44 percent of students suspended more than once, and 36 percent of students who are expelled.

&gt; And this racial disparity is not because black students commit more infractions than their non-black peers, as the 2014 Obama letter laid out.

693,e00wbx2,"Some of our sisters have been brainwashed. We have so many things to worry about and deal with, none of which involve defending misogynistic men in wigs and dresses. Frankly, I think this is just another extension of us having to coddle black males no matter what. We are less likely to report DV because it is our responsibility to keep them out of the criminal justice system, not their job to keep their hands off of us. We have to stroke their egos and get condemned for having an education or jobs. There is scarcely a more criticized black woman than the scorned “independent” black woman. Remember how every rapper felt the need to chime in on Ciara moving on with Russell Wilson and call her all color of names but had nothing to say about Future running around with strippers and having babies everywhere? Can you imagine for one moment a radio station taking calls from a white male artist to criticize a white woman singer to denounce her new relationship? 

Have you noticed that BLM was created by two black women, yet the marches only happen when a black man gets killed. Sandra Bland got a hashtag. Where were they to take to the streets when that cop in OKC was targeting black women to rape while he was on duty? Where are they to protest the maltreatment of black girls by school resource officers? We’ve seen these incidents on video yet we haven’t seen much of a response. 

This rabid support for TiM is an extension of the pressure we are under to put ourselves last, put our daughters last, and put other black women last. What is so disturbing is that we have a dreadful problem of our girls being sexualized at younger and younger ages (shout out to R. Kelly’s stans) and these TiMs promote the hyper-sexualization of black women and girls. We must stop letting one another support this! 

The bottom line is that none of the black women who ride for TiMs truly see them as women. They know that they are black men and they are doing what we’ve been conditioned to do all of our lives: protect black men. We are deluged with stories about how badly they are treated and how unfair it is that they are imprisoned in facilities for men. Meanwhile, the likes of Laverne Cox is reading weepy letters for a former Latin King who tortured, raped, and broke the neck of a little black girl before setting her body on fire. When can we expect Laverne or Janet Mock express outrage over the principal’s office to prison pipeline black girls are being sucked into? When can we expect them to protest the fact that women in prison don’t have access to pads or tampons? We can we expect them to stop acting as if women’s prisons are safe? We can’t expect them to but we can expect to have our fellow black women yell at us for asking that question. 

We have to check one another if this madness is to end. I have had to put some people in their places and I’ll be glad to do it again. I will not be told that I’m participating in a white supremacist patriarchal system by women who are in bed with an ideology driven and funded by rich white men. I will not listen to someone who agrees with the statement that lesbians like me refusing to fuck a man in a wig or not wanting to shower with a man is the same as white only water fountains in the Jim Crow south. I refuse to be a participant or a spectator in my own oppression. If someone wants to be mad about that, she can stay pressed because I’m not going to remain in this perverse process of protecting black men at our expense. We’ve been doing it forever and rabid support for TiMs is just another version of it. "

The unemployment rate among black Americans has been consistently [twice the unemployment rate](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/21/through-good-times-and-bad-black-unemployment-is-consistently-double-that-of-whites/) among white Americans since 1954, which is the earliest year for which we have consistent data. This is due at least in part to racial bias (which is often subconscious) on the part of interviewers and hiring managers; the [same resume with a white name gets better responses](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9873) than it does with a black name. This unemployment pattern is present even when we correct for education level; black college graduates are [twice as likely to be unemployed](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/african-americans-with-college-degrees-are-twice-as-likely-to-be-unemployed-as-other-graduates/430971/) as white college graduates. 

Speaking of education: 62% of white college students [graduate within six years](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/04/26/college-completion-rates-vary-race-and-ethnicity-report-finds), compared to only 38% of black college students. In K-12 education, black students are [three times as likely to be expelled or suspended](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-discipline-snapshot.pdf) as white students. Boys are more likely to be suspended than girls overall, but black girls are twice as likely to be suspended as white boys and six times as likely as white girls.

And the perception that black people are more disruptive/threatening/misbehaving/whatever than white people is present not just in school but in the criminal justice system. Black minors are [18 times as likely to be tried as adults](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-a0035663.pdf) as white minors. Black people make up [38% of the prison population](https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_race.jsp) despite being only [13% of the US population](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045216). This is in part due to the fact that black men receive [sentences that are on average 19% longer](https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/demographic-differences-sentencing) than those given to white men who have committed comparable crimes. We even have drug laws that impose [harsher penalties for drugs used primarily by black people](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2010/08/03/data-show-racial-disparity-in-crack-sentencing) than for drugs used at comparable rates among different races. Black people are [30% more likely to be pulled over](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/pbtss11.pdf) while driving than white people, and once pulled over they are more likely to be ticketed and/or searched.

Since I don't believe that black people are significantly less competent, less smart, less well-behaved, or more dangerous than white people, I am forced to conclude that to get these results, the deck must be stacked against them.

Edit: forgot a link"
695,dyt8ic3,"Black girls are your best bet, they get by far the least attention (confirmed by online dating studies), most men don't want to date a black woman, a lot of black guys don't even want to, or just use them for sex. And like a quarter of the black population of males is in prison lol"
696,dx25mqj,"&gt;Mittleman *estimated* that only 38 percent of the disciplinary risk could be explained by the students’ reported behavior.

He guessed.

&gt;Mittleman is cautious about drawing conclusions, but says discrimination by teachers or staff could be responsible for the other 62 percent. 

Doesn't want to draw conclusions.  Draws one anyway.

&gt;If that’s true, then this data “challenges the idea” that homophobia is experienced in a gender-neutral way, he wrote.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that nobody likes angry dykes.

&gt;One theory posed by Mittleman and others is that school staff and administrators may perceive lesbian and bisexual girls as more threatening if they present themselves in a “masculine” or gender nonconforming way.

Or they present in hostile way.  Chicken or the egg, I guess.

&gt;If a student eventually retaliates against her harassers, she might be the one labeled as the aggressor and disciplined. In schools where police officers patrol the halls, that could even mean an arrest.

Makes a great case for school choice:  Don't force our LGBT youth into these oppressive environments just to consolidate power and control for teacher's unions.  

&gt;“Part of it has to do with cultural conceptions of what it means to be a good woman or a good girl,” said Danni Askini, the executive director of the *Gender Justice League*, a Seattle-based gender and sexuality civil-rights organization.

She sounds like the executive director of a queer super hero club.

&gt;This report didn’t specify if other factors — like a student’s race — compounded the risk of discipline for LGBT students.

I have a feeling this report didn't specify many things, what with all the estimates (guesses, feelings) and lack of conclusions drawn (limited liability.)

&gt;That study found that American adults think black girls are less innocent and seem older than white girls of the same age. 

[Maybe that's because they start menses, on average, sooner than white kids; and that may be related to fatherless and attachment styles](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-stone-age-mind/201202/why-are-girls-getting-their-periods-so-young)  

[Maybe that's the higher rate of teen pregnancy](https://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-development/reproductive-health-and-teen-pregnancy/teen-pregnancy-and-childbearing/trends/index.html).

&gt;They’re also three times more likely than their white peers to be disciplined for bullying, harassment and disruptive behavior, according to another study.

Ya, that's probably racism.  But then again, boys get disciplined and medicated way more often than girls.  Partly because boys act out more, partly because school is socialized to favor female forms of interaction, and partly because most educators are female and they bias towards favoring girls at the expense of boys.  Repeat this cycle millions of times and it bears out, statistically.

&gt;As teens and adults, lesbian and bisexual women are also overrepresented in prisons. Though only 4.4 percent of U.S. women identify as LGBT, they comprise about 42.1 percent of the female prison-inmate population, according to a 2017 analysis of a National Inmate Survey.

So lesbians commit more crime.  Good to know.  Oh, and here's the quote from the survey the times used....

&gt;By contrast, we found that 33.3% and 26.4% of women in prisons and jails, re-spectively, identified as lesbian or bisexual, **a proportion that is about 8 to 10 times greater** than the 3.4% of lesbian or bisexual women in the US population.

That's compared to the proportional (but still slightly higher) representation of gay men in prison compared to the US population (about 5 and 3%.)"

whos underachieving? its definitely not black people, but that still hasnt helped us from being second-class citizens in the eyes of the law, the justice system, and american culture and economics"
698,dycpbng,"Alright alright alright lets see here. 

&gt; Black people absolutely face systematic oppression. Statistics overwhelmingly support this. Black people are more likely to live in poorer neighborhoods than white people who have comparable incomes. This illustrates that income isn't the main factor when it comes to segregation. Housing segregation is a real and powerful deterrent to black families.

is there no choice of where you can live or something?

&gt; There is an overwhelming discrepancy between the wealth of white households and black households. White households are, on average, worth 13 time more than black households. White people make up 64% of the country's population, yet have 88% of the country's wealth. Compare this to black people who make up roughly 13 percent of the population, yet only make up 2.7% of the country's wealth. The median outcome for white families in 2011 was $111,146 versus $7,113 for black families.

inequality of outcome is not inequity. 

&gt; Between 1984 and 2009, the wealth gap between whites and blacks has almost tripled despite the promise of equality, post Civil Rights Movement. This shows that white people are able to accumulate wealth at a much faster pace than black people and that there is an unequal distribution of opportunities.

nope nope nope. inequality of outcome is not inequity or unfairness. you can't make logical jumps farther than Steph curry can make a 3. 

&gt; The recession had less of an impact on white families than it did black families. From the years 2007 to 2010, the average white income fell 11% compared to 31% for the average black income. In addition to this, the home equity of white families fell by 24% versus 28% for black families. More shocking, is that the retirement savings of white families actually grew by 9%. For black families, retirement savings fell by 35%. This indicates that black families had to tap into their savings to make ends meet, whereas white families were still able to support themselves without tapping into their savings.

can't derive causation from this. 

&gt; Black people are more likely to be the targets of subprime loans compared to white people who have similar credit scores. Subprime loans are loans given to people that don't qualify for the loan at a prime rate due to poor credit history. Instead they are given the loan at a subprime rate, which has a high interest rate. In other words, there was over a 30% chance that blacks would receive higher interest rates than whites of similar credit history.

didn't look at this one. 

&gt; Conversely, minorities are more likely to be rejected a conventional mortgage loan than whites with similar credit history. According to statistics, the Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) denied housing loans to 40% of all African American applicants versus just 14% of Caucasian applicants in 2012.

didn't look at this one. 

&gt; Black and Hispanic children are more likely to attend underfunded schools than white students. One study showed that a 10% increase the number of minority students corresponds to a $75 decrease in spending per student. In other words, for every 10% increase in students of color, the school loses $75 for every student that they have. On average, schools invest $334 more on white students than they do on non-white students.

not racism. it's the no school choice and where people group up to live. white people are generally more affluent therefore likely to be educated/smart as well (without facing adversity).  

&gt; One study showed that black boys are thought to be older and less innocent than white boys of the same age (i.e. black children are dehumanized). This contributes to minority juveniles receiving harsher sentences than white juveniles.

I'm sorry that implicit bias might exist? but doesnt the higher gang participation rate among blacks have an effect on how much crime and how bad of a crime is committed? and this one doesn't even say similar crimes. also I'm not sure how being thought of as older and less innocent is dehumanizing someone. if white participants in the study have white children, (this is a guess) they probably associate their kids moreso with other white kids. 

&gt; In the USA, white Americans use drugs more than black Americans, however black Americans are arrested over three times more than white Americans for drug possession.

I'm guessing the white people drugs are cocaine and such (more white collar stuff, there are more white people in the US so it would make sense if there are more white people in nicer jobs) so they're probably smart about the way they go about it.

&gt; Black Americans receive nearly 20% longer prison sentences than white Americans who commit similar crimes.

didn't look at this one. (on mobile)

&gt; According to a 2o03 study, white men with felony records are more likely to get a job interview (17%) than black men with clean records (14%).

can't derive causation here. 

&gt; Employers are more likely to turn down job applicants who have names that don't sound ""white"".

I think that's the fault of the parents. if you give your kid a name like Sharkeisha, you must know that it's going to give certain impressions. 

&gt; Black Americans are less likely than white Americans to positively benefit from social mobility. If you are a black American, you are less likely to advance in social class and more likely to fall in social class.

can't derive causation here. 

&gt; And lastly, people will ask about affirmative action. Surely it provides an unfair advantage to minorities over whites, right? Wrong! The truth is that the greatest beneficiary of Affirmative Action is, in fact, WHITE WOMEN. Yet whenever a black person finds themselves at an institute of higher learning or holding a competitive job position, they have to face people who doubt their qualifications. ""The only reason why you're here is because of... (duh duh duuuhhhh!!!) Affirmative Action."" But a white woman who has a position has earned it purely out of merit.

&gt; Affirmative Action Has Helped White Women More Than Anyone | TIME.com

affirmative action helping white women is just as BS as it helping anyone else. anyone who gets to cut corners could potentially be subpar and it should be based on merit alone. if more white men turn out to be qualified for something then don't scream racism. 

once again, you can't derive causation from statistics alone. which this guy did sometimes. 

[watch this. Start at 23:00](https://youtu.be/IFqVNPwsLNo). I'll read more into those links later on and keep my mind open, truthfully. sure racism exists and has existed. but the government is not systematically pushing it, nor should you give up. the victim mentality will keep you down no matter if the problem is real or not. you have the power to take responsibility for yourself and fix your situation. if you resign it to ""systemic racism"" then you've stopped yourself from being able to do anything.

&gt;• The post-Columbine era saw the introduction of federal and state laws instituting zero-tolerance policies, which assign “explicit, predetermined punishments to specific violations of school rules, regardless of the situation or context of the behavior.” At the same time, in the streets, the war on drugs led to more punitive criminal legal responses, such as three strikes and mandatory minimum sentencing .

&gt;• Speaking to U.S. News &amp; World Report in May, other researchers also blamed the fact that many black girls attend schools with fewer resources for their disproportionate targeting by harsh disciplinary policies.

703,dlfp26n,"One of the largest benefiters of affirmative actions are white women, one of the reasons for this is that white people in general live in area with stronger education infrastructure and opportunities. Another large factor is that boys, particularly black boys are more likely to be subject to suspensions at an early age, which is shown to lead to more suspensions and large amounts of time out of class, this is part of the school to prison pipeline. So the increase the number of men in college doesn't require that we end those programs, its to look at what is holding them back and solving thoses. This includes ending suspension as a punishment for children below a certain grade, ex 3rd grade; more male teachers; and improving the use of resources between schools."

706,fvaleip,"It’s about respect for the culture. Someone’s culture is not your costume.

In the same note, people get mad when white girls wear braids bc black girls are often discriminated against for their hair.

And opposite sex is no comparison to culture. Historically, the line of male/female dressing is not consistent. Saying well if girls can wear pants and guys can wear skirts then I should be able to wear brown face or some shit like that, you neeed to re-evaluate your dress standards and your standards as a human.

711,erxrl6l,"I gotta say something about this topic cause it's been killing me not to...  ""barely legal/teen"" is not just about being petite. 80 yr old women can be petite too. The criticism of ""barely legal"" porn, isn't meant to pick on petite women's bodies. The average American women's height is only 5'4... so a lot of women would actually fall into the ""petite"" category.      

Thankfully, most ""younger"" looking, petite women, will not be confused as teens for their entire life. It usually lasts only until maybe early 30's. It's not really about looking like a teen, as it is about a majority of people being that terrible at ages. Idk if Hollywood warped people's perceptions of what teens look like? Could be that some people just lazily label people under a certain age, or a certain look as ""teens"". But there also isn't too much of a difference in looks for most people, when they go from teens to late 20's, unless something significant happened to ""age"" a person (illness, stress, excessive drug use,  etc). Idk why society thinks women in their 20's age significantly (most don't). Even a majority of my friends (MID 30's), look pretty damn ""young"" still ... not really changing much. And most would've passed as their younger late teen selves, through most of their 20's.        

As far as calling out pretend ""teen"" porn, no one should bash on petite women... **the women being used for that type of porn, ACTUALLY ARE  TEENS**... porn companies aren't looking to use youthful looking 20/30 yr old women -- they use the youngest they can... which eightTEEN. Since a lot of women in porn enter that young, only lasting 6 mos on avg, **it's safe to say those are really teen bodies** -- not a bunch of 30 yr old women, we're supposedly criticizing as having teen-like bodies. Teen porn also relies on perverse stereotypes about teen girls... the school girl look, pigtails, the ""innocence"", etc. They aren't exactly going for some female doogie hauser character, because (surprise, surprise) that's not what men want to jerk off to!         

I do understand the frustration of women being treated less respectfully because people assume they are younger than they are. I myself have been hurt by medical professionals assuming this without looking at my actual age. However, I do not get offended by criticism of teen/ barely legal porn, which to me, is about more than simply being petite with youthful traits. I know the criticism isn't directed at a woman's body type, but at a porn stereotype. Especially when all women, regardless of looks, somehow fall into a fetish category, because all women are treated like cuts of meat.        

**If anything, I'm angry at men &amp; porn for putting women into these sick categories. Women criticizing porn weren't the ones saying certain traits are ""teen-like"", or XYZ... men started that crap, as always.**               

I know you brought up women too, so I want to address that. Yes, women can make awful comments sometimes &amp; be condescending. I truly believe though, that this still stems from this fetishizing of ""youth"" in general, esp in women. It seems like that's just getting worse &amp; worse with time.      

I personally don't see my body as child-like, just because of what people say. I know I'm not a child &amp; that my body is the body of a 30 something yr old woman. It does get better with age though &amp; as much as it aggravates me, I know there's all types of women that feel terrible about their bodies. I've known tall long legged, attractive women, that feel bad when they are treated the opposite -- that they should be smaller. They too fall into a fetish category. I had female friends that were told they looked older, that would get depressed because people started screaming at them that they are too old to go tricker-treating at 10/11 years old! It really hurt them, esp seeing the 15/16 yr old petite girls not have a word said. Adult's expected more from them &amp; they were more severely punished. Women of certain races know this all too well. Black girls are treated horribly because they are assumed to be ""older"", while Asian women are fetishized for looking ""younger"". I know thicker build women that wished they were smaller built. There's big breasted women wanting smaller breasts, &amp; vice versa. There's women that chase youthful looks their entire life... that feeling is the same feeling many women have &amp; we need to realize it's not our body type that's the problem, that's to blame, or being personally criticized when body type trends are called out."

It's not the kind of stuff I'd look at (Actually never found Ada that attractive, don't really know why), but I won't judge people for what they get off to as long as it's not causing any harm or disturbance or if it's a child.

713,er2dfy6,"&gt; I'm nice to hateful people all the time. Its actually easier than being an asshole back to them.

First off, there's a difference between being polite to terrible people, and trying to be friends with them. A huge difference. 

And again, black people are not being assholes to white people. And no, this article doesn't count as that because the article is literally about the FBI admitting that BLM aren't terrorists, and that there's a spike in violence of white people doing shootings. Discussing that isn't ""being an asshole.""

&gt; It's not. Just because you don't enjoy it doesn't mean you aren't chasing it.

Then sure, I am chasing it. I am stepping up and trying to teach people about racism because I think it's something we have to fix. So what? Didn't this whole thing start because you said I should be doing something instead of just talking about it? And I pointed out that talking about it IS doing something?

&gt; Just because humans can have minor unconscious prejudices doesn't mean they're racist.

This is why I recommend you do deeper reading into racial justice. You seem to think that racism looks only like a white person yelling racial slurs and that ""minor unconscious prejudices"" are harmless and not really something to worry about.

Those ""minor prejudices"" can actually do a lot of harm (arguably more) and ignoring them guarantees we'll never have racial equity. For example, if you subconsciously consider black kids as older and less innocent, think of how many consequences that can have. [Here's an NPR article on one way it can be harmful](https://www.npr.org/2014/03/19/291405871/consequences-when-african-american-boys-are-seen-as-older). Black boys are 18 times more likely to be tried as adults than white boys. 

[so you can call them ""minor unconscious prejudices"" if it makes you feel better](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-sociologist-examines-the-white-fragility-that-prevents-white-americans-from-confronting-racism), but the outcomes are still harmful and they still need to be addressed."
714,ec6zfmw,"What?! That's a thing? I'm a white dude in Brooklyn who definitely thinks black girls are cute. I like it here to say the least.

For me I mostly find attractive women from all races, it more or less comes down to liking my cooking and laughing at my terrible jokes."
715,e48acly,"First of all, you are clearly watching a different show than the rest of us if you actually think candace stays to herself, minds her own business, and is there for everybody. She does/is none of those things. Examples : kirk and the bar fight/cop thing, telling aimee codi was using her for no apparent reason, getting mad at her boyfriend for getting along with her roommates, getting mad at kortni for not involving herself in drama, and when has she ever went out of her way to ""be there"" for any of them, other than the 1 time with kortni and her mom &amp; friend. 

Also candace is NOT ""every"" black girl. What an ignorant thing to say. Candace is a human being with good and bad qualities, who happens to be black. There is no such thing as every black girl, because black girls are just girls, who have black skin/ancestry whatever. Some black girls are terrible people, some aren't. Some are nice, some are smart, some are funny, some are dumb, some take care of theirselves, some do not, they are literally just people, like anyone else. This is a part of why the country is so divided right now, because people like you insist on sticking people into categories, instead of seeing them as individuals "
716,e09erei,"I think there might be a difference between the kind of woman willing to date them, vs dating you. 

I bet they have a bunch of stories about dating terrible black women which is why they date white girls now.

Edit: Which is why they date *terrible* white girls now. They found a way to excuse the terribleness that is the common thread and this was not meant to imply black girls are terrible to date. "
717,dvo9qfr,"That’s funny, I’ve heard mixed reviews. Some were terrible and some were tight. But many guys said black girls were size queens so therefore some guys said black girls are loose. Many guys who had Asians did say they were the best though. Yes, I did see this discussion somewhere and there was even a poll"

As a bi white guy, I have the opposite thing but with black guys. I do feel terrible afterwards. Thankfully this is just a fantasy and usually fantasies go away after a few months. I don't find black guys attractive, it's mostly the contrast of a BBC. So take what I wrote with a grain of salt.

Anyway, black girls are fine but mostly if their on the lighter end. Were I grew up and still live, most blacks are american airman's and are a bit lighter skinned than the ones who aren't, the few classmates I have who are black are really black, like Dee Wae meme black. Not appreciative of the latter."
719,ds9mdcv,He had bad experiences with black girls at tournaments so he sort of generalized that all black girls are ratchet and terrible at fighting games. People construed it as racism.
720,dk05rxl,"&gt; I disagree - I think 12 is probably the right age (or thereabouts) to know the specifics of that sort of thing (any younger than that should be at the discretion of the parents).

I ***strongly*** disagree, for a few reasons:

1. A large percentage of girls will already be having their periods by then, and speaking from experience, having your period without knowing what they are is absolutely terrifying.
2. Parents are notorious for delaying talking to their kids about puberty because they want their kids to ""just be kids and not grow up so fast"".
3. Most parents today were educated before proper sex education was widespread, and have terrible knowledge themselves. More than 80% of American adults believe that vaginal tightness is based on number of sexual partners, for one example. 2015 was the first year in which more than 50% of women understood that douching is bad. In the famous Durex study only around 20% of people were even close to guessing the average penis size. I think it's madness to say that parents should be providing medical information when we know for a fact that a majority of them have not only a lack of knowledge, but a lot of false knowledge.
4. Children will never ask their parents embarrassing questions and usually want to just end these conversations as quickly as possible, even if their parents *are* qualified to explain things.
5. This puts the children of single parents (who are less likely to talk to opposite-sex children about this stuff or to have the requisite information even if they do) and the children of religious or conservative parents at a major disadvantage in terms of self-esteem, comfort with their own bodies, etc.
6. A third of black girls are menstruating at 10 and a majority are by 12. If you want to explain puberty at 12, you're  likely explaining it to a room full of students have been going through it for *years*."
721,fxwscwy,"Nta. I went to a catholic school like this. It's always ""we don't want them to think their looks are more important than school"" yet they quite literally tell you that your looks ARE more important than school by removing you from the classroom for the slightest dress code violation. It's ridiculous. And your issue was definitely based on race. It's widely documented that black girls are punished more severely in school than other students, and this is unfortunately just another example of this. The way you were treated was horrible."
722,fz6aogo,"I've always been blunt and raw and as a result it made people talk about me even more. I'm not rude I don't go around and talk about me being blunt and introverted has made me a targeted for many people including the teachers I talked about in my post. I've been through a lot and I don't find most people to be genuine. 

There's plenty of other women specifically black women that have have had similar experiences, but they keep quiet because when you say these kind of things people find a way to blame you so the majority of us keep quiet about it because if we have a lot of bad experiences in our lives people want to question and act like you have to be a horrible person for bad things to happen to you.  I've had people willing to put me in harms way for temporary stafisitcation. I don't think most people are morally good people.

Edit: Introverted people are more likely to be bullied extroverted people. This has been proven, if your skeptical about it I suggest you look it up. Black girls are already expected to be the stereotypical extrovert screaming at 7am, if your not people look at you like your insane and start to get an attitude. ""Why does she think she's better than everyone?"",""Why is she so quiet?"" Most of my conflicts have started from people being nosy and wondering why I'm introverted. I've dealt with it since middle school. People getting an attitude with me like I did something horrible to them because I kept to myself. It has made me a target for so many horrible things, but I'm not going to change myself for other people so I can be accepted by society.The only ones I've seen being accepted for being quiet, and docile are always lightskinned mixed girls. 

It is what it is though. I don't hate my skin color for it. I don't think I'm unattractive.I just wish things were different."

726,fsu8nau,"Anyone who teaches blacks soon learns that they have a completely different view of government from whites. Once I decided to fill 25 minutes by having students write about one thing the government should do to improve America. I gave this question to three classes totaling about 100 students, approximately 80 of whom were black. My few white students came back with generally ""conservative"" ideas. ""We need to cut off people who don't work,"" was the most common suggestion. Nearly every black gave a variation on the theme of ""We need more government services.""

My students had only the vaguest notion of who pays for government services. For them, it was like a magical piggy bank that never goes empty. One black girl was exhorting the class on the need for more social services and I kept trying to explain that people, real live people, are taxed for the money to pay for those services. ""Yeah, it come from whites,"" she finally said. ""They stingy anyway.""

""Many black people make over $50,000 dollars a year and you would also be taking away from your own people,"" I said.

She had an answer to that: ""Dey half breed."" The class agreed. I let the subject drop.

Many black girls are perfectly happy to be welfare queens. On career day, one girl explained to the class that she was going to have lots of children and get fat checks from the government. No one in the class seemed to have any objection to this career choice.

Surprising attitudes can come out in class discussion. We were talking about the crimes committed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and I brought up the rape of a young girl in the bathroom of the Superdome. A majority of my students believed this was a horrible crime but a few took it lightly. One black boy spoke up without raising his hand: ""Dat no big deal. They thought they is gonna die so they figured they have some fun. Dey jus' wanna have a fun time; you know what I'm sayin'?"" A few black heads nodded in agreement.

My department head once asked all the teachers to get a response from all students to the following question: ""Do you think it is okay to break the law if it will benefit you greatly?"" By then, I had been teaching for a while and was not surprised by answers that left a young, liberal, white woman colleague aghast. ""Yeah"" was the favorite answer. As one student explained, ""Get dat green.""

There is a level of conformity among blacks that whites would find hard to believe. They like one kind of music: rap. They will vote for one political party: Democrat. They dance one way, speak one way, are loud the same way, and fail their exams in the same way. Of course, there are exceptions but they are rare.

Whites are different. Some like country music, others heavy metal, some prefer pop, and still others, God forbid, enjoy rap music. They have different associations, groups, almost ideologies. There are jocks, nerds, preppies, and hunters. Blacks are all -- well -- black, and they are quick to let other blacks know when they deviate from the norm.

One might object that there are important group differences among blacks that a white man simply cannot detect. I have done my best to find them, but so far as I can tell, they dress the same, talk the same, think the same. Certainly, they form rival groups, but the groups are not different in any discernible way. There simply are no groups of blacks that are as distinctly different from each other as white ""nerds,"" ""hunters,"" or ""Goths,"" for example.

How the world looks to blacks: One point on which all blacks agree is that everything is ""racis'."" This is one message of liberalism they have absorbed completely. Did you do your homework? ""Na, homework racis'."" Why did you get an F on the test? ""Test racis'.""

I was trying to teach a unit on British philosophers and the first thing the students noticed about Bentham, Hobbes, and Locke was ""Dey all white! Where da black philosopher a'?"" I tried to explain there were no blacks in eighteenth century Britain. You can probably guess what they said to that: ""Dat racis'!"" One student accused me of deliberately failing him on a test because I didn't like black people.

""Do you think I really hate black people?""
""Yeah.""
""Have I done anything to make you feel this way? How do you know?""
""You just do.""
""Why do you say that?""

He just smirked, looked out the window, and sucked air through his teeth. Perhaps this was a regional thing, but the blacks often sucked air through their teeth as a wordless expression of disdain or hostility.

My students were sometimes unable to see the world except through the lens of their own blackness. I had a class that was host to a German exchange student. One day he put on a Power Point presentation with famous German landmarks as well as his school and family.

From time to time during the presentation, blacks would scream, ""Where da black folk?!"" The exasperated German tried several times to explain that there were no black people where he lived in Germany. The students did not believe him. I told them Germany is in Europe, where white people are from, and Africa is where black people are from. They insisted that the German student was racist, and deliberately refused to associate with blacks.

Blacks are keenly interested in their own racial characteristics. I have learned, for example, that some blacks have ""good hair."" Good hair is black parlance for black-white hybrid hair. Apparently, it is less kinky, easier to style, and considered more attractive. Blacks are also proud of light skin. Imagine two black students shouting insults across the room. One is dark but slim; the other light and obese. The dark one begins the exchange: ""You fat, Ridario!"" Ridario smiles, doesn't deign to look at his detractor, shakes his head like a wobbling top, and says, ""You wish you light skinned.""

They could go on like this, repeating the same insults over and over.

My black students had nothing but contempt for Hispanic immigrants. They would vent their feelings so crudely that our department strongly advised us never to talk about immigration in class in case the principal or some outsider might overhear.

Whites were ""racis',"" of course, but they thought of us at least as Americans. Not the Mexicans. Blacks have a certain, not necessarily hostile understanding of white people. They know how whites act, and it is clear they believe whites are smart and are good at organizing things. At the same time, they probably suspect whites are just putting on an act when they talk about equality, as if it is all a sham that makes it easier for whites to control blacks. Blacks want a bigger piece of the American pie. I'm convinced that if it were up to them they would give whites a considerably smaller piece than whites get now, but they would give us something. They wouldn't give Mexicans anything.

What about black boys and white girls? No one is supposed to notice this or talk about it but it is glaringly obvious: Black boys are obsessed with white girls. I've witnessed the following drama countless times. A black boy saunters up to a white girl. The cocky black dances around her, not really in a menacing way. It's more a shuffle than a threat. As he bobs and shuffles he asks, ""When you gonna go wit' me?""

There are two kinds of reply. The more confident white girl gets annoyed, looks away from the black and shouts, ""I don't wanna go out with you!"" The more demure girl will look at her feet and mumble a polite excuse but ultimately say no.

There is only one response from the black boy: ""You racis'."" Many girls -- all too many -- actually feel guilty because they do not want to date blacks. Most white girls at my school stayed away from blacks, but a few, particularly the ones who were addicted to drugs, fell in with them.

There is something else that is striking about blacks. They seem to have no sense of romance, of falling in love. What brings men and women together is sex, pure and simple, and there is a crude openness about this. There are many degenerate whites, of course, but some of my white students were capable of real devotion and tenderness, emotions that seemed absent from blacks -- especially the boys."
727,fxkf33s,"Race isn't real, but race is a construct that affects people in horrible ways.

One of the examples of [peer-reviewed studies](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/03/black-boys-older) I'm referring to is about how young black boys are considered more culpable for their mistakes than white kids.

If you view a child as more of a threat than they actually are, that's going to lead to harsher punishments for the same mistakes.

I have a boyfriend who respects me and he’s great, but darker black girls are the only women who act like men sexualizing them is just horrible in every way and that’s weird af. Do you ever hear light skinned women complain about men liking them? White women? Latinas? Asians? No! It’s always black girls and it’s because black girls are more insecure and don’t realize men are just sexual. If a guys attracted to you then he’s sexually interested.

About 40% of the girls currently on the show are not white and they're mostly doing just fine. Both Samira and Yewande do not know how to flirt. They're both beautiful girls, but they're not good at playing the dating game, so of course they're not going to do well on a show about dating. On top of that, neither of them were interested in anyone at the start, and I still don't think Yewande gives a shit about any of the men in the villa. Not everything is about racism, and I think the more it's brought up as a race issue, the more people hang on to that stuff."
733,ezw2k5s,"Somewhere in this thread someone posted a source that basically admits that black kids gets punished much harder than their white counterparts.. both girls and boys. But black boys especially. They’re seen as more mature and less than innocent than they are. In the source is also said that 10 is the age. Fucking 10 is the age where some white oriole decide that black boys are more mature than white boys and won’t benefit from coddling it whatever. 

Tbh I noticed it. My elementary school (k-6) at the time was like 80% white and 20% black.. well maybe even less than that. I know in our grade.. we had classes of 25 and there were like 3 or 4 black kids per class. Maybe even 2 and in some cases none. 

I definitely noticed that we get treated the same until like 4th or 5th grade.. so age 10. I was a quiet kid.. so I mostly observed and noticed that my black and white peers could do the same thing but my white peers would get multiple warnings while my black peers got 1.. sometimes not even that.. and after the warning the punishment for the black kids would be much harsher. 

Like notes home.. moving your clip from green(great behavior) to red (horrible behavior) and looking back that whole chart was fucking dumb but it still hurt so much. The white kids would only move there’s to yellow(slight disruptions).. and then they’d be allowed to move it back to green after a certain amount of time 

It only got worse as we got to middle school. At this point everyone was aware of what racism was.. they wanted to be edgy(but some were actually racists) and they(white boys) would provoke my (black) female friends until they got angry and snapped.. and my female friends got in trouble every time. You try being calm while we’re in black history month talking about slavery and people are saying stuff like “if we went back in time I’d own you as a slave” some were when dropping the hard r and laughing. 

Or they’d comment on my friends hair and say it’s fake and laugh. They’d comment on all of our hair.. my hair was very much real.. and I’m non confrontational and not easily provoked so they could never trap me into getting in trouble. 

And the few times I would actually get in trouble I’d get punished much harsher than my white counterparts who’ve been warned multiple times to stop. 

my hair I remember to distinct times I didn’t even get a warning.. just “move your card” or step outside.. and then proceeded to get screamed at. Or I had to write the same sentence over and over 150 times in a set amount of time. 

What’d I do those times? Pass a single note in one grade, laugh in the other, and the last one was bs but I was sitting near someone who was playing with fucking glue and being stupid. I wasn’t even involved. I was just sitting near them. I honestly still wonder if I got in trouble because she thought I was involved..because all the black children were near that area"
734,eeoi2cy,"The problem here, of course, is what constitutes toxic behavior.

Why looking at a girl's ass should be bad? By jove, we were made interested in sex as a species. This is a GOOD THING, it's hard coded to perpetuate the species, for the flames of Fanelia!
Girls do that too, trust me, it's just they're more sneaky about it. If you're gay or close friends with a girl you've seen them checking a guy's ass more times than you can count. They usually comment it with you.

Hitting on someone? Granted, very explicit passes should require consent, but why should I not say hi to a girl I don't know, if I'm interested? Cue the videos of girls walking down the street: approached by both rude people and people literally saying hi, both demonized because ""objectification"". Congrats, you've discovered sexual drive in a sexual species, now why should that be bad? 

By contrast, isn't it toxic behavior a girl that while in a committed relationship flirts with other guys? Isn't it demeaning of their partner's status as a person that they do not leave them before doing so? ""hey, I just check if there's someone better than you interested in me, if there is goodbye if there is not hey baby I love you cm'ere I was just joking"".

Why isn't it toxic behavior for girls to bully the fatass in class because he's horrible? For girls as shallow as dirt pools to laugh at his naive confessions for them, possibly with friends listening in and laughing?

We call out ""toxic behavior"" for men that isn't really toxic, and we ignore horrible behavior from girls because... Ah, well, girls are beautiful flowers, are they not?


Wait, I had a wonderful idea. I'm making a commercial for Gillette razors for women.

Some girls check out the ass of a man in a pub. The man is oblivious. One of the girls likes what she sees: she takes the initiative and asks him to pay for her drink.

A man with warts on the nose and specs approaches one of the girls. ""uh... Uhm... Would you like to drink something?"" ""piss off, nerdy"".

739,e1ux8qy,"I’d rather pay for a child to be born than be forced to pay for their termination, like with Obama care. 

 As for the crime you speak of let’s not sugarcoat it; it’s young blacks. Now, before someone calls me racist, it’s factual. Abortion was brought into the United States on a racist agenda, to “eradicate all negroes”. Are you aware that in New York city more blacks are being aborted than born? That’s startling. 

Like I was saying the problem here isn’t abortion or even lack thereof. Like many problems in the us it stems from a culture of getting someone pregnant and leaving her to either raise the child or get an abortion, the culture I’m talking about exists primarily in ‘ghettos’ around Chicago and stuff. We need to find a solution for it. Too many young black boys are being “raised” without a father figure and turn to a life o led crime and then repeat what their father did and get a girl pregnant, and the pattern continues. Look at the violence in Chicago. People complain about cops shouting black (horrible when they are innocent cops should be better trained but that’s another topic) but an even bigger problem is black on black violence. 

My solution is NOT to terminate the child but get to the root of the problem here. Both sides need to work together to put back together cities such as Detroit, Chicago, hell even San Francisco. "
740,dyio0up,"Flirting is an entirely personally thing. That's what makes pua stuff like that backfire so hard. While there are some who just so happen to be able to pull off that weird ass style, I. E. The drunk chatty dude who rambles and random nonsense but is still kind of cute in a teddy bear way, it's only effective like a stopped clock is right twice a day.

All flirting is is expressing your interest beyond friends in any way that happens to be comfortable to you. That's why it's helpful to try and experiment by just making friends with girls you aren't attracted to at all and just playfully flirting in a way that allows you both to drop your defenses since you both know it's just for fun. A lot of girls like playing that game. In my experience black girls are often really used to it and theyll know you're just being friendly.

Eventually you want it to become a baseline for you and that's the only way. To just suddenly dive into the deep end and try it with someone you are actually attracted to is going to likely go horrible.

The boy in this case, as horrible as his crime may have been, is still a minor and that law recognises that. It seems this ""trying as an adult"" purely exists to punish black minors in an over the top, disproportionate manner.

Also, you should know that ""thug"" is a very common racist codeword that's used when people can't get away with saying ""nigger"". It would be a very good idea to stop using it if you don't want to appear racist."

I feel like it was timely, especially after the R. Kelly documentary. 
And here's the thing: if Gillette made a women's ad against falsely accusing men of rape (like if she was shaving for a night out, and had a one night stand with a guy that was lackluster), I wouldn't be offended. I don't falsely accuse men of raping me. Hell, where I live, prepubescent girls are called ""fast"" for being forced into sex by their nasty uncles, and those same uncles are invited to the cookouts; no sense in telling anyone when adults think you have no innocence.

760,dneksht,"I am sort of in the same boat as OP as to what im looking for. Problem i am having is that majority of these black girls are too ghetto for me. Too much drama, too much gold digging, not much intelligence to offer. I am of Caribbean/latino decent so the attraction is there. I get lots of attention from these girls but then they love testing with this gold digging mentality. Most of the time it is a turn off to have to game so hard for a girl that can only offer me mediocre sex. Right now i am dealing with about 4 different girls, all of whom are pretty and have nice bodies. Have jobs but don't seem to be interested in offering anything other than their good looks, of which they are even insecure about. 
I have my life together more than the average guy they meet(my own apt, luxury car, travel, good credit) I've had them many times ask me to buy them lunch, gifts, etc. To which my response would be, ""im not your sugar daddy"" ""not that im cheap, but anything i give, would have to be earned""
One even got upset because i told her i would not take her out to eat on a first date. And if we did go out to eat for the first time, it would be 50/50. To which her response was a nasty face and her repeating ""omg you would go dutch""

To me the game has changed when it comes to dating these black or just urban women in general because they now idolize the female hip hop icons who have gotten where they are today through their gold digging past. 

Betas and white knights don't make it any easier as I would handle and shut down gold digging shit tests and the girls will just shrug it off with their abundance and just goto the betas to get what they want monetary wise. Which is fine with me, im not trying to be the provider. But my goal is still to be the alpha fucks and give them the D. 

What's a player to do in these days/situations?"
761,djfrbqn,"&gt;Because it affects exactly the same people. It's called indirect discrimination (or ""adverse effects""): when a specific group is targeted by a rule or policy that merely has the appearance of being neutral. It's like when an employer requires a maximum of 5 years of experience for a job, in order to indirectly weed out the older applicants. On the face of it, it looks like it applies to everyone equally, but it doesn't.

So if I high five every black person in the country, is it no different than if I shoot them all? I think you're confused about what is being said here. Just because the ratio of gay-to-straight people is the same whether you're talking about catering a gay wedding or serving a gay person, doesn't mean those two things are the same.

&gt;I'm only objecting against the exaggeration of the role a baker actually takes in the ""sinful"" activities. Functionally, a cake is really only an embellishment to the wedding. The actual marriage (i.e. the creation of the marriage bond) is typically completed before the cake is even touched by anyone; it plays no role in it.

I'm not exaggerating anything. I'm pointing out the difference, and it's a difference that OP has accepted. One is serving a person, the other is serving a person specifically celebrating the thing about that person the baker finds sinful.

&gt;There is no real difference. It's not like straight brides and grooms are also disadvantaged if a baker is refusing to cater to gay weddings. By its effects, the act of refusal because of the event being gay is indistinguishable to a refusal because of the customers being gay.

There is a real difference. The problem is apparently the only thing that matters to you is the RATIO of gay people to straight people. So you can't artificially narrow the scope of what the word ""difference"" means and then claim there's no difference. There is a difference and it's obvious. In one scenario gay people can't utilize the bakery in their everyday lives. In the other, they can't utilize the bakery in one specific example. Those things are DIFFERENT THINGS.

&gt;I don't know if you support race-based bakery discrimination too, but it would be like saying that you don't serve interracial or black weddings, but you're happy to serve bagels to anyone. A judge will see right through this kind of double talk.

Yes I disagree with similar legislation on race, because I don't think the government has a right to make you interact with somebody, even if you think they're refusing on mean or nasty grounds.

&gt;I have nothing against rules or polices that affect all customers equally, such as a prohibition on hateful cake writings, hate symbols (e.g. swastikas), pornography etc.

One of the problems with this is that it is subjective what fits into categories like that. So really what you mean when you say ""affect all customers equally"" is you mean it affects all customers in the way you want, or ""equally"" based on things you care about, like skin color, gender or sexual orientation.

&gt;Equal treatment of groups of customers (especially minorities) is a legitimate and moral societal interest, just like hygiene and rules against anti-competitive behavior. I do believe that society should have the right to demand non-discrimination of minorities, because creating a market where everyone is treated equally in comparable situations will create a market where everyone has similar opportunities, which is also better for the market in the long run.

1. I don't agree that *even if* it's ""better for the market in the long run* that gives you the right to tell people who they have to interact with.

2. It's not *at all* clear to me that these laws do more good than harm. There is plenty of unintended harm in these sorts of regulations in the form of people being afraid to not serve (or employ) somebody based on some protected class status, when maybe they should. For instance, if a group of rowdy young black boys are in your store, you might be wary about kicking them out for being too rowdy because you might get sued. Then what if they end up indeed costing you customers for being too rowdy? I'm not sure exactly how often this happens, but that's the point, it's not calculable. Similarly, how many false lawsuits have bankrupted people or put them out of business over claims of discrimination that weren't true?"
762,fyrt54e,"The 13th amendment still allows for slavery. Also while on the books there might not be laws expressly disparage black people and Other POC, in practice it is much different. It's been proven that black boys are tried as adults more often than white boys, receive harsher sentences, and are denied health services way more often than their white counterparts. The rates of homelessness is higher l, redlining is still a thing, job discrimination still exist, black communities also suffer more under police oppression than other groups 

It is not a small fraction if the whole system supports those people. Qualified immunity literally stops police officers from being punished for on duties crimes. People are protesting cops killing people wait till they start protesting all the cops who rape women while they're being arrested and get away with it. So no we do not have laws in place to stop those evil people especially when our governors and president whip out a pardon willy nilly.

They're not being punished by the law. Starting with our president all the way down. The law is practically meaningless when you're rich and white or a police officer. Also YES THE FUCK we should protest evil people that's how you get rid of dictators and wanna be kings. We must combat evil wherever and in whomever it arises.

It is written in the Preamble 
""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.""
Key words, We The People in order to form a more perfect union. It doesnt say to just accept everyones faults and sing kumbaya. It says to form as much of a perfect union as we can. To consistently strive for it. To establish Justice. Promote General welfare and secure the blessings of liberty and prosperity. Which is what these protesters are asking for."
763,fatmr6q,"&gt;I don't give two fucks about the kid with the MAGA hat getting beat up. Back when I went to PWIs and even when I went to a school that was fairly integrated, those white kids always had some racist shit to say. Whether it was straight up calling your whole family Niggers, or if it was some shit about how black girls are masculine.

So what you're saying is that because someone white did something bad to you a long time ago, all people who are white are evil. You know, there was a group of white people that used the same idiotic ""logic"" to vilify black people. When your actions draw direct parallels tot he KKK, that's not a good look for you."

770,du0lnaw,"""Gamer"" is a weird label anymore, and not because of stupid ""journalists"" trying to say ""gamers"" are dead, more because everyone and their grandmother plays videogames now. And beyond the most basic definition of ""do you play games? You're a gamer"", it would be a nightmare to try to define.

That being said, if you play videogames and you enjoy it, then good for you. Nobody cares if you're a girl, or if you're black. Sure, some children might comment on it to be edgy; they do that. But last time I checked, Bloodborne doesn't have a ""no coloreds"" policy, and there's no sign on the Overwatch box saying ""no gurls allowed"".

Wanting more diverse playable characters is fine, and I can accept that you want to be able to play as your race/gender/ethnicity/whatever else. Surprisingly, this is something you've been able to do for a long long time in many games. Mostly RPGs, and mostly MMOs, have character customization options that let you choose a lot of detail for your protagonist. The Sims does it, Monster Hunter World does it, Sonic Forces does it. Other games, like Borderlands, let you choose between multiple different characters with varying backgrounds, ages, races, and genders.

And this comment you bring up about ""anyone other than a white male""... mobile games by and large don't even have characters, games like bejeweled or candy crush, triple town, even clash of clans don't have a ""protagonist"". The most common mobile game genre is gambling and slots. You're not playing as anyone. After that, you have all the games where you play as non-humans, like sonic, kirby, TMNT, Goat Simulator, Ori and the Blind Forest, and Super Meat Boy. And finally there's the whole host of games where you're playing as... you. You're the person in the FPS, shooting at all the evil aliens (who, I promise, are not a surrogate for brown people) you're the badass bounty hunting parkour enthusiast chasing down targets for a criminal organization, and you're the... disembodied robotic arm trying to make tea or the invisible will controlling all these surgical tools.

Now, if you're looking for games where the protagonist isn't just customizable, is a human, and is specifically, only, a black girl, that's cool too. Like you pointed out, those exist, and they can do really well. There's nothing preventing more games like that, but having a black female main character isn't what makes the game good. It's the story and experience and adventure of the game. Sure, the story might have something to do with the unique experiences of a black girl, and that wouldn't work the same if it was someone else, but you're not playing as ""black girls"" at that point, you're playing as an individual person who is a black girl.

You made a comment that ""black girl gamers deserve to be seen because we exist."" And I don't quite understand what you mean by that. Are you saying that you're being hidden away from the public eye while other groups of gamers are shown at the forefront? If that's the case, I suspect it's because the media that showcases ""gamers"" nowadays are specifically targetting gamers for being bigoted or hateful because they make jokes online. These ""gamers"" are painted as exclusively white males, usually straight, and it's implied that these aren't just the 10-14 year old children trying to impress their friends (and the rest of the world) but actually all men everywhere, and I feel like black girls aren't included in this group because the people shitting on ""gamers"" don't want to shit on all gamers, just the white, straight, male ones. I agree that it's stupid to exclude people from a (specifically non-ethnicity, race, or gender-specific) group based on their ethnicity, race, or gender; but having organizations for ""black girl gamers"" is inherently divisive and exclusionary. You're separating yourselves from the rest of the gaming community. I'm not saying you shouldn't have organizations that cater to different demographics, but I doubt you're going to find many ""jewish fisher gamer"" communities, though certainly there are gamers who are jewish and fishers. There's probably no ""Paralympic medalist austrian gamer"" group. Though in this case, it's probably a much smaller category than ""black girl"", so that's reasonable.

Gamers have historically gotten a bad repuatation, but that's because historically gamers have been the out-group. We were the basement-dwelling neckbeards or the reclusive heliophobic nerds who didn't fit in with people in real life social situations, so we passed our time with activities that didn't require face-to-face interaction. But because we've all been ""the outcasts"" at one point, or even just felt like we belonged online more than at a party, gamers have been very welcoming of anyone and everyone, including girls, and people of all backgrounds. If you're a gamer, you're a gamer. You're not a black girl gamer, you're not a jewish fisher gamer, you're not a white male gamer. You're a gamer who happens to have other identifying characteristics, but those all don't matter, because you're a gamer. You're here to play a game and have fun. So just be a gamer. Absolutely keep focusing on increasing the amount of games with things you like in them. I'm a fan of puzzle-platformers, so I buy as many as I can. You're a fan of games with black female protagonists, so get your hands on them and play them through as well. Preferences are fine; everyone's different. But we are all gamers.

Now comes the part where I have to be a shitlord for 30 seconds and attack you personally, author with a silly first name. I don't truly believe you're a gamer. I believe fully that there are plenty of gamers who are black, plenty who are women, and those two overlap somewhere so there's no doubt there's loads of black female gamers. But you're not one of them. You wrote an article about how so far the only option has been white male, when some of the most iconic and mainstream games featured literally 0 white men (or humans at all). You low-key attack developers for not making games that you want, though you **TOTALLY** know there's loads of different genre of game, many of which have no protagonist at all, but those don't count because... it's inconvenient to your narrative? You bring up good, valid points in your article, but this shit about asking questions and getting a bigoted backlash, needing to be seen in a more positive light, and whatever you were saying about some sisterhood bullshit, none of these are valid, none of these are important, because none of these are relevant. You might have been condescended to because of your inexperience, but it's not because you're a girl or because you're black, it's because you're new; that shit happens everywhere. Just look at common fandoms for examples of people being ridiculed for not knowing what wholock is. Acting like black girls are being negatively portrayed in any way, anywhere at all, is completely false. This isn't happening, nobody is going ""hey look everyone! It's a black girl! She doesn't belong here!!!!"" and rallying a mob to chase her out. You're trying to create an imaginary struggle and share this revolutionary idea of yours that people shouldn't be assholes to each other in order to get internet brownie points from the PC police. And the sad part is it's going to work; people will laud this as brave and bringing important discussions to the forefront of the community. Instead of rightly dismissing it as the discontented whining of a college student (graduate? dropout? who's to say) trying to make a name and get a foot in the door of their first media relations job.

I'm tired and confused by a certain somebody insisting that i'm racist because I think black girls are cute and my gf is black. Even more confused because this person had no clue who I was. For all he knew when he made the comment, I could have been a 15 year old Chinese girl as easily as a 80 year old black dude. 

I'm physically tired from having to walk an hour to work because I managed to warp my car's engine. So real life factors into my reply time. 

Any other questions, or can I go back to my little racist corner and continue hating white people for being nosey little shits who spend way too much time actively looking for reasons to hate things?"
774,f96ntv0,"If you like fantasy, I’d recommend Dread Nation by Justina Ireland. Set in civil war America with zombies, the protagonist Jane and her rival Katherine go to a school where black girls are trained to fight the dead.

It’s really good, and not your typical Mean Girl charade. It starts with girl-girl rivalry but there’s no romance or fighting over boys and they eventually learn to (somewhat grudgingly) respect one another when things go awry in their town. Katherine is the more ladylike and girly of the pair and uses it to her advantage constantly; she ended up being my favourite character in the novel!"
775,f273koe,"I'm not saying they didn't say those things, but that description sounds hilariously one sided.  They're just innocently trying to park and some people come up and tell them to learn how to park and calls them bitches?  Then not only that but then inside confronts them for no reason and calls them black lesbian bitches? 

Those are the cartoonish descriptions of somebody trying to make them look maximally innocent. The reality is probably closer to they took a parking spot from underneath the other white people (or at least that's how they viewed it) and then inside they white people confronted them about it and there was probably some jawing back and forth that the video obviously doesn't show. 

It's always hilarious when people can't see that a description of an event is 1 sided and just takes it as gospel.  The white people are probably douches and acted douchey but i highly doubt the 2 black girls are entirely innocent in the war of words."
776,evvyc9t,"&gt; ‘It is time we admitted that we are not at war with ""terrorism."" We are at war with Islam.’

Out of context. He further said, 
*
""‘we are absolutely at war with the vision of life that is prescribed to all Muslims in the Koran.""*

That's not the same as you make it sound as if we are at war with all muslims.

And in his article where he talks about profiling, he discusses people like you specifically taking the statement out of context, as a conscious, dishonest tactic:

*""Of course, many of my detractors (like Greenwald) have used this quotation in ways calculated to make readers believe that I want dark-skinned people singled out—and not just in our airports, but everywhere. What my critics always neglect to say, however, is that in the article in which that sentence appears, I explicitly include white, middle-aged men like me in the profile (twice).""*

You also took his other statement out of context. He isn't staying we *should* nuke Muslims. He said that if a jihadi group gets their hands on a nuke, that may be the only option available to us.

&gt; that’s shitty.

No, it's not. Religion is shitty. All religions are untrue mythological stories. There is no Zeus. There is no God. These stories hold humanity back and inject a dimension into our thought processes that are counter-productive to everything we want the world to be.

&gt; That’s advocation for explicit racial profiling; not considering ethnicity is “crazy.”

Conceded. But I am ok with profiling. Facts are facts. 4 year old black girls are not blowing up airplanes or taking people hostage. White men and muslims are."
777,efwmvq7,"It's clearly a case of mistaken racism for classism.

Minorities think nice neighborhood means white people. This kind of healthy social life is not gonna do well in the hood. But what is not mentioned, is that it's not good advice for most trailer parks either. Having meth dealer friends is as bad as crack dealers friends.

Plus, a 12 year old white boy and friends look like children to cops. Yet black boys are mis aged by five years up. So, they look like a gang to cops.

Healthy parenting advice like this only works in a healthy community. But somehow we are fighting as races. When we should be fighting as income classes.

There has always been a class war. The middle class are becoming the poor. And the poor are losing. "
778,eadd7bl,"In the mid-90s I went to Mississippi to do a credentialing review of a large non profit social service agency.  My colleagues were from Michigan and New York state.  The racism we ran into was appalling.  We were all white and the white people at the agency seemed to expect that our outlook on race would be the same as theirs.  I recall being at lunch with one of the directors in a small town where a festival was about to occur.  Some celebration of the days before the Civil War ruined everything for them and it featured a parade with lots of little white girls in big white hoop skirted dresses.  My colleague from Michigan said ""but of course black girls are welcome to take part"" and the director looked at her like she was crazy and said 'well, no, in 1840 little black girls didn't wear big fancy dresses'.   Though I agree with all the comments about racism being everywhere, the three of us talked about how it wasn't quite that overt in Michigan and New York and Washington State.   "
779,ebg4stz,"No black girls seems to be the most popular answer. I think , it's like a -2 penalty but people are acting like mixed girls aren't a thing. Blacks so dark they glisten aren't attractive, but I think people are just indulging their racism when they say all black girls are unfuckable. A hot mixed or light skinned black girl mostly looks like they have an extremely deep tan and big lips. The hotel aidss twins from Lord Of War are a case in point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6obos6sz8E. 

People really love their racism and are afraid of miscegenation even though it's already happened enough to make Africans and African Americans visibly different.."
780,e0wdj0q,"I've been impressed with a few debuts this year! I liked *Dread Nation* by Justina Ireland (the civil war ended prematurely due to a zombie outbreak, so it's sort of early Jim Crow where black girls are trained as ""companions"" to wealthy white ladies where the goal is to protect them from being bitten by a zombie). The narrator's voice was great, and the story was interesting and a lot of fun. Ditto *Torn* by Rowenna Miller, which is about a thread/embroidary mage caught in an uprising against the upper classes, where she's got friends on both sides of the conflict and is pulled in both directions. It's great at showing the people who are typically ""unseen"" in revolutionary stories, mainly those who provide goods or services for the well off (and so interact with them on a regular basis).

I thought *Gunslinger Girl* by Lyndsay Ely was a good YA debut, in a sort of blending of modern day tech with the wild west and Annie Oakley. "
781,dyvjdpk,"What does whites being the majority of the population have to do with attempting to universalize their views, political preferences and interests? I notice you sure as hell don't seem to have any stats to back up the stuff that you are spouting about a raising economy benefiting everyone. There was just a massive study published that followed all kids who were born in the last 30 years that shows that what you say is unequivocally untrue. Rich black boys are far more likely to end up poor than rich white boys holding all other variables constant. Not mentioning race sure doesn't fight racism. Again, racism is an economic issue for non-white people in America. The most egalitarian era in America was the post-war decades and those sure as hell weren't good times for black people. I'll wait for you to come up with some actual data backing up your assertion. I will provide mine right now.

"
784,dkbk2os,"&gt; I am curious on how much Argentine students learn about Britain? 

British invasions (both of them) and the war of 82

Thats it, if we see anything about the middle ages its mostly Spain and the industrial revolution is covered as a europe-wide event.

&gt;I was also wondering how do you view the UK and British people people(and culture too)?

Most people are indiferent/don't care. A few are still angry about the war and the islands. There are some anglophiles though

&gt;What are race relations like in Argentina?

There aren't? barely anyone but fringe far-right (and ironically enough far-lefts) talks about race here

We do have a class problem which is only getting worse

&gt;How are non-white foriegners veiwed and treated in Argentina?. Are they welcome?

No problems as long as they behave, just like everybody.

Black girls are always welcome ;)

&gt;Are non-white Europeans

Which are those? 

&gt;European = White to many

Yeah mostly, I mean we also have a lot of Syrians from the times of the ottomans but they are fully ""argentinized"" now. Same with Argentine-Jewish which were mostly from the russian empire to the point most people didn't call them ""jews"" at all but Russians. In fact Ruso (Russian) here is considered almost a nickname for Jewish people even if they are of the less numerous sephardi community.

&gt;What is the LGBT situation like in Argentina?

Actually better than in most of the EU or US from what I heard

&gt;What's the ordinary Argentine person's opinion of Argentina's past

""We were almost USA 2""

Literally...

&gt;present

It sucks

&gt;and above all future?

Grim, very grim

&gt;Whats your favourite non-Argentinian cuisine and why?

Japanese, not a big fan of sushi tho

&gt;And also do you like British food?

Barely any here besides roastbeef 

&gt;what is the opinion about the Argentian state's treatment of the pre-European native peoples?

The left likes to basically copy the US-left discourse regarding natives but here the situation was considerably different. We had even less natives than north america did. The ones here never reached the level of complexity and population density of Pueblo, let alone Mayans, Olmecs, Aztecs and Incas which were true countries completely destroyed by spain. A lot of natives here (mainly the Tehuelches) were wiped out by non-Argentine natives from Chile (the mapuches) armed by that country when we were fighting for control of Patagonia. Then we almost wiped out the mapuches, mostly for being foreign invaders. A lot of the tribes decimated by them actually helped in the 'conquest of the desert' war as revenge.

Most of the hate today gets directed towards Roca and Sarmiento but in all honesty they were following the ideas of their time. They were reformers instrumental in taking the country away from the yoke of spanish obscurantism which was one of the main causes why Argentina became so advanced compared to nearby countries at the time.

Personally I'm far more concerned about the treatment of native Argentines **right now**. The Kirchner regime liked to pretend they were progressive but they treated the natives up north like trash for 12 years.

&gt;Argentina is a very religious country

Not really, nowhere near the zealot level of the US, Mexico or Brasil

Also lots of Muslim and Jewish Argentines don't follow halal/kosher rules

&gt;so is atheism is accepted?

Very, it was only a problem during the Junta years because they would think you were a communist

Ironically a lot of communists here were still christian

&gt;So howcome Argentina isnt like that?. How have you managed to avoid such a fate?

Crime is actually worse here than before but yeah nowhere near the levels of those other countries.

I think the fact we are (despite the jokes) less race-concerned helped a lot, also that we had less inequality with a huge middle class while in those countries you had the super-rich doing whatever they wanted and everybody else had african-quality of life with a very tiny middle class working for the rich or the state.

&gt;What's the level of English proficiency like in Argentina?

We recently made it to the top 10 of non-english countries in term of average english knowledge, even more than india iirc

Probably the highest among spanish-speaking countries

As for #17......we really don't have any of that here. They might call you 'shorty' as a joke if you are short but you're not going to be ostracized like you say happens over there, same with being fat. "

786,fzdfl20,"The most awful thing i only learned recently is how sexualized especially young black girls are.

White people on average, but especially men, judge young black girls as older, more promiscuous and more sexually active and open towards their advances in general. The study found that black girls as young as 11 were seen as sexually active and ""open"" for sexual advances... it was sickening...

I hope i can find the study i was talking about, but just googling a variation of this topic already shows many studies done that prove this.

Association? Wait is this... a paper about **implicit bias**? Which is junk science at worst and highly criticized at best?

https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/

http://archive.is/EDwBg

&gt;Teachers More Likely to Label Black Students as Troublemakers

And are black students actually more likely to be troublemakers? Black communities tend to have high rates of single parenting, which often leads to dysfunction in kids.

Oh, wait, no, it was one of those studies where they put a teacher in test conditions and assume it represents behavior in reality. They also gloss over the idea that a teacher might've **encountered** more **actual** troublesome black kids to *create* the bias.

In fact, this sounds an awful lot like another version of an implicit bias test.


&gt;Black Students Face More Discipline, Data Suggests

...Okay, you know that example I used? Where I implied something happening more to black people doesn't actually prove it's because of racism?

You're doing the **exact same thing here**, but with schools and shootings instead of cops and killings.

So you lead with two studies based on the same flawed idea, and a third that had a mistake I *just* criticized. And the fourth appears to be along the same lines. I don't think it's worth continuing.

And I strongly doubt you've checked all those links, and *their* sources. The first one alone uses, what, dozens?"

789,fnjymp7,"no one wakes up feeling that way. 

what happens is in society young black girls are made to be aware of their different features to young white girls. their hair is different, their skin is different, etc. sometimes they are told awful things. 

then all of a sudden socialites start tanning because it creates the idea that they’re sitting in bora bora like rich girls should. then they braid their hair because it’s cute. they wear chanel (gucci?) durags because it’s classy. they inject filler into their cheeks and lips because they’ve always been insecure about their features~. they can’t stop because this is the image of beauty to them. 

then actresses start doing it. more socialites. then girls all over social media all want to give off the same energy—i’m 16 but i could be in bora bora sitting on my ass. i wanna look like a bad bitch because it’s cool. now you have white girls inspired by their favorite socialites. 

meanwhile black girls are still made to feel different. when they look like those socialites but they don’t spend thousands of dollars looking that way. this has always happened. no one woke up suddenly and said “i want to be black.” they want to be black without having the real experience of being black."
790,flfo273,"I'm so sorry about that, that's an awful thing to say. Black women are gorgeous. I'm a Pakistani girl and I think black girls are pretty - their chocolate skin is very beautiful, but besides that they're very worldly people. This is racist, but based off my observations white girls don't know what it's like to have to adapt to your skin color. They have things handed to them, and they're kind of ignorant. I started going to public school and they wouldn't speak to me because of my skin color and my hijab. But this group of black girls welcomed me to their lunch table with open arms, and I couldn't get over how kind a gesture it was. 

I've wished I had a different skin color a lot as well. I mean, at least a solid one, right? Black or white? I've gotten a mucky color in the middle - yellowish-green it seems to me when I look in the mirror. I can't pretend I know what it's like to be a black girl but I empathize with you, friend. :) 

I hope you will realize that you are beautiful and a lot of men would fall head over heels in for you. &lt;3"
791,fj3exls,"Omg please. I had to stop watching Love Island UK because of the fandom and how dark skin black girls are treated as love interests. 

Remember black men's experiences in dating out their race and black women's experience of dating outside their race are different. For starters, any fetishization of black men (which is awful) does tend to reinforce their masculinity. I don't know why some guys don't have a problem with being reduced in that way or hypermasculinized in that way, but at least they are acknowledged as men. 

Black women also tend to be treated as not being feminine enough for not entering Eurocentric codes of beauty. 

Like look at how both Priscilla and Leanne knew not to bother pursuing someone like Luke M. 

I really wish people got this point that even within racial experiences, gender can affect the outcome."

I'd imagine the 20% who don't have it done will be the ones at the upper end of society. Eritrean girls / women are absolutely stunning as well, or at least based on the ones I've met, really beautiful.

The girl I knew was from Lagos, and actually from the city itself and not some remote village or even around the outskirts where you might expect this sort of thing to be more prevalent. It's also crazy to think that most of these people who do this also follow religious values that consider tattoos and piercings as desecration of the body God gave you, yet here we are chopping their genitals off to try and stop them from being promiscuous - shows how much faith they have in the Bible or whichever book they follow!

My Mrs has a friend who had also been circumcised as a child and she really has never forgiven her parents for it since she grew up and realised exactly what it was. I remember telling her about girls in the UK (or West in general) and how much money they pay for labiaplasty to have their lips trimmed down and this girl just got really angry about it - like, if these girls could see what girls are forced to go through they would appreciate the fact that they've actually still got everything down there and learn to love their natural bodies more. To her, this was the ultimate symbol of ""white privilege"" - choosing to pay a lot of money to have what African girls are forced to go through."
794,f4s9l39,"I totally disagree. A much simpler and more reasonable explanation, in my opinion, is that they just don't think that it will affect *them,* and that's good enough.

Most casual racism isn't any kind of active animosity against a race. It's believing casual lies and stereotypes, or simply not thinking about them at all. It's an inability to empathize with other races in the same way you do with your own, not an active desire to harm them. Yes, it's subconscious. But it's not subconscious animosity. It's subconscious *apathy.* Kind of like how people don't seem to care as much when black girls are the victims of crimes. Nobody (except for the more realized, hateful racists) is actively thinking the black girls aren't as valuable as white girls. Most are just sub-consciously thinking that things that happen to black girls don't affect them. The slightly more racist my also have prejudices about black girls that makes them doubt their stories or innocence. But nobody who isn't a full-blown despicable racist is actively wishing harm on other races.

I'm not trying to downplay the horribleness of casual racism. Its effects are absolutely awful and important. But I think it's absolutely a mistake to misunderstand the reasons behind it or assume that it comes from an *active* effort on the part of casual racists to hurt or disenfranchise anyone. Most casual racism is garden-variety selfishness, ignorance, and apathy. Not active animosity."

It's so bad that just describing it sounds like a joke or an exaggeration but it's a real thing, look up ""Foolish Pride"". Plus he's said faggot plenty of times and I don't see anyone bringing that up...

And if you want more examples of homophobia, A Tribe Called Quest made an entire song mocking gay people, it's called ""Georgy Porgy""

Or how about every DMX song? Or how about when Vinnie Paz said ""I'll beat a faggot till he ain't fuckin gay no more""

All of that is way worse than just saying a no-no word and then not apologizing hard enough

I'm not saying we should tolerate hate no matter what, and you're free to stop supporting an artist for whatever reason you want, even if it's really stupid

I think the thing that bugs me most about this is that it's an example of groupthink, the outrage against her was fairly widespread so now she's an acceptable target, but if there was a random thread about a DMX song, or Eminem or ATCQ or Vinnie Paz or a bunch of other rappers, people would think you're being ridiculous.

799,edl8ssi,"It's great that people are speaking out against these pedo apologist arguments, but we should keep in mind that this problem is multifaceted.

Misogynoir is one such angle. Black girls are commonly stereotyped as less innocent, sexually available, promiscuous or otherwise 'mature'. Combined with the stigma surrounding sex creates the pervasive attitude that whenever sexual violence is inflicted on black girls, it's their fault. Saying that ''They shouldn't have been in that position in the first place.'' denies the sexual aspects of teenhood and is a ploy to relieve guilt from the pedo, because ''the victim wasn't a saint''. The same rhetorical trick is used to justify police brutality.

Another and far more pervasive angle is the profitability of pedophilia. How is acting like a pedo good for profit? It's the fantasy of maturity that makes it profitable. Advertising marketed towards teens almost never feature any actual teens. Most teen don't look mature or sexy. It's mostly 20-something topmodels that get on the frontpage because that's an unachievable bodylook that you can easily sell teens on. If you repeatedly tell them that all good and attractive teens look like they're 23, their impressionable minds will eventually believe it. They will start buying 'adult' things like make-up from an earlier age which means more profit in the long run. 

A secondary aspect is that it sells insecure man an easy answer to his failure in love: Just date a teen. Advertising and media portray teens as sexually and emotionally experienced to fit the narrative that they are emotionally mature enough to date men twice their age. It doesn't matter that teens are easily coerced and very inexperienced, because they're 'mature', that makes it totally consensual and not creepy at all. Just look at the people they use to portray teens and how the camera and narrative in media is framed to convey that message. Their complete lack of sexual inexperience is framed as something to be desired, because insecure man fear to be compared to a more experienced or better sexual partner. Yet they still expect this teens to appear and act as sexually fulfilling as they were advertised. Spoiler alert: Sexually inexperienced people, especially virgins, are generally bad at lovemaking no matter how good they look.
Instead of fixing their bad attitude or awful communication, these men will spend their time and money on companies that enforce this narrative. It isn't a surprise that they'll try to apply this to the real world. They'll espouse dating someone significantly younger. They'll praise virginity as a sign of 'untainted goods'. They'll sexualize and groom kids to make it seem like everything was completely consensual.

Speaking out against pervasive attitudes isn't enough. Industries need to be held to higher standards if we truly try to fix this."

Just remember how beautiful you truly are and that you are capable of achieving great things just like many other dark skin black girls are. You definitely deserve to live freely in your skin, and be proud of your blackness. 

Society has spent centuries trying to make us feel invaluable. Thankfully, it hasn't worked on me, but it still is a struggle being a black woman to this day. One thing, though, is that we are still great people. Most of these itty-bitty little white girls always try to copy our culture and our looks. Don't you see now? And these mixed race girls' looks can't replace our nubian features, regardless of what society tells them. If they can't appreciate you, you don't need them.

I know I've been a little harsh in some of my responses to you, but a lot of that is because of IRL experiences, as well as getting bombarded with PM's telling me what a sexist nazi fascist pig I am. 

I understand your position as a trans man better than you think. I dated a trans woman for a while, and the complications that arose from that was fucking awful. 

I'm not some misogynistic, repressive, hateful person.

But I've been abused by people using the guise of ""feminism"" to excuse all their behavior.

What's more, the university I just received my masters degree from is currently going through a very public ""Metoo"" moment that is based on complete total bullshit. As someone that was unfairly caught up in that shit, I feel like I am completely justified in my stance.

I was destroyed by a woman in power, and was told that it didn't matter what she did because she was a woman and I needed to back off because they needed more woman in positions of authority at the university.

I sat in classes by this woman, where she gave us a chart of math score for students in high school. She talked about how black girls are falling behind all other girls on their math scores, and what we as future teachers needed to do in order to help those girls. Next to those girls scores was the boys scores, which were grayed out, meaning not important, and in every category boys were doing either as bad or worse than the black girls. When I pointed this out she told me I was a sexist.

I was told I was a racist and conservative monster, was excoriated for the horrifying platform of the current administration, despite voting for Clinton. Despite dating a trans woman. Despite my relationship after that being an immigrant black woman from Ghana. Despite working for several years as a teacher and social worker in inner city Akron working with underprivileged kids, teaching special education and working with Nepali and Bhutanese refugees.

I can't support feminism anymore. Or the democratic party. It's become perverse. And anyone who tells me it's all in my head is fucking sheltered or lying."

804,dz030rm,"This is gonna be long, but I’m a black girl and I can give you my personal take on it if you’re actually interested.

I disagree with people being upset that he’s dating a non-black woman. In addition to a shitload of other *real* things, there’s increased sensitivity  (I’m gonna attribute to social media’s circle jerk of depression and pain from personal and societal experiences) that causes what may seem like an overreaction (I.e. “___ hates black women”) and unfortunately it reinforces stereotypes of “anger” and “jealousy”.

There are just certain things that a majority of black women go through, feel, and hear throughout their lives that nobody else will understand. There are certain triggers that are just hard to explain and complex. A lot of it goes back to the history of black women in this country. They should really teach black history and black women history in schools because it explains so much and that is misunderstood, and I’m sure there’s still a shit ton of stuff I don’t even know. But anyway...

There’s also a history of “blerds” (black nerds) saying that they don’t date black women because they don’t like the same things or don’t relate to them. It seems so simple and I don’t think there’s wrong with people having preferences. HOWEVER, whether they mean it or not, it’s almost rooted in the same idea as a black person being told they sound white because they “sound smart”. Nerdiness is associated with whiteness. So when you’re essentially hearing “I’m into white things and you’re into black things, therefore I don’t want to date you” it doesn’t feel too great and can sound like being into black things is a bad thing. 

Is this the exact thought process? Probably not, but hearing “I can’t relate to you” from someone that looks like you and has family that looks like you (at least in the black community a lot of times) just doesn’t sound or *feel right*, and I think that’s why. This whole “blerds” not dating black girls is a “thing” and there are many instances of them badmouthing black girls and other underlying issues.  It’s not an unfair assumption that there’s a dislike of black girls going on there (we’re viewed as the bottom of the barrel to a lot of other races so to feel that from a man that’s the same race as you...it sucks) and that’s because it’s just the reality that black girls face, whether people understand it or not. 

For example, look at all the tweets shitting on black women that celebrities have had to apologize for. Hating black people, ESPECIALLY black women, has become a “normal” stage of people’s self-growth journeys. Those people can apologize and move on with their life, but those people who those hate tweets are written about are left with that hurt. It’s hard not to wonder who else in their lives think/have felt the same way about them...and it’s hard for it to go away.

There’s a recent episode of Catfish with a blerd (I really do hate using that term lol) and towards the end he starts talking about how he doesn’t date black girls and doesn’t like them and it gets awkward as hell. Then they ask him to repeat it in front of his *black* sister’s face (who is taking care of him) and she breaks down in tears. There’s just something about it that goes deeper than just “preference” sometimes, and it makes some black girls feel awful with good reason.

I personally couldn’t care less about who he dates, but I do care about other black girls and their feelings. He should date whoever he wants. Their family is fucking adorable. Do I think Donald hates black women? No. Do I wish people would stop saying it? Yes. I’ll remain a fan of his work (been listening since middle school), but he definitely gets a permanent side-eye from me for a lot of comments he’s made in the past, and I honestly don’t know how I feel about him as a person. I understand why other black girls are offended, and (in the nicest way possible) others just have to step aside sometimes and let people vent (unless they’re bigots or something like that).

At the end of the day Donald will continue to live his talented ass life and the “Donald hates black women” comments will blow over. It will just be written off as another overreaction by SJW and be looked at as “silly” and “not that deep” for for better or for worse. Idk if you actually wanted an explanation (probably not this long ass one of you did lol) but this is just my personal opinion on why some black girls might be saying that. Things that seem simple sometimes are a lot more complex and have a long history behind them."
805,dt88icr,"I dunno if you're trying to mock the girl who posted before, but it sure as hell seems like it and it seems very uncalled for as what black guys go through is completely different from what black girls go through in terms of their own self image.

I've seen far more black man, white girl couples than I have seen the reverse. I don't think black guys have to worry nearly as much about being undesireable due to our skin color (Though there are certainly going to be girls who don't date black guys) as women do .

Did you see some of the stereotyping and i'll be blunt -- racism that was in that thread? I didn't bother calling it out there, but there were comments like ""Black girls are all loud, obnoxious and sassy"" or ""All of them are obese"" or ""They're too ghetto"". The stereotypes for black guys might encompass some of those negative stereotypes, thus making us undesirable, but there's also the stereotype of masculinity associated with black men which makes us *more* desirable.

I don't think that people quite understand some of the self-image issues that seem to be all too prevalent in the black community with girls and women, Chris Rock did a documentary on the type of shit girls will do to be more ""white"". Stuff like damaging their hair by ironing it to make it more straight, some trying to pay for surgery to make their eyes blue, there's also too many cases of girls trying to bleach their skin -- it's fucking awful.

In the other thread it seems as though some of the posters missed this kind of context and don't understand it, thinking that it didn't make sense for the OP to lack confidence that she is desired by plenty of men, but it's a problem that is a little bit more widespread than you might think. Even the female black characters on TV often have physical traits that are white rather than black to make them more ""ideal"" and ""attractive"", so it's not as if the insecurities come out of nowhere."

808,fyxko13,"Based on my anecdotal experience as a teacher, not empirical research:

This is even worse for Black girls. Black girls are treated as sassy, rude, etc., and are less likely to be diagnosed, and additionally less likely to receive their services if they are fortunate enough to be diagnosed. I had to fight to get a Black female student tested last semester, because everyone thought she was “difficult” and didn’t want to help a senior in her final semester. I could not believe she’s never been tested because she had all the hallmarks of autism and ADHD. But because she was cute, female, and Black, nobody thought to help her. 

I am profoundly sorry for your experience and the failure of the system to help you."
809,g0myzij,"Well, straight still works if we come to the understand that I laid out above - heterosexual men are attracted to transgender women and many engage in sex with trans women while homosexual men and heterosexual women are vastly less likely to do either. I did that because the topic at hand calls for addressing who is sexually aroused by transgender women and who is likely to engage in sexual relations with transgender women and as I pointed out failure acknowledge realities of situations like these means that we can't properly address the how's and why's as to why a sex trafficker like Jeffrey Epstein may have trafficked transgender women and to whom.


To use another example of why it's relevant to dig deeper, let's look at the fact that [Epstein wasn't trafficking black girls and women.](https://fox17.com/news/nation-world/new-epstein-documents-detail-scope-of-sex-trafficking-08-01-2020) If we want to understand his operation and who he appealed to we have to understand the decisions that went into his operation, including a decision like this. It's easy to write this off as him being racist but it wouldn't get us anywhere, it's a dead-end for speculation. You could speculate that some of his clients are racist and, sure, that's a given, but even a lot of vehement racists wouldn't turn down their nose at an opportunity like that - never stopped people in the past (take out a $2 bill for evidence of that) and it wouldn't stop many folks today. There's a lot of reasons you could speculate but I think it has something to do with the fact that black girls are already very highly trafficked and thus available elsewhere - Bureau of Justice statistics have shown for years that racial minorities, particularly black and latina girls, are more likely to be trafficked than white counterparts. It's not unreasonable to then make a leap of logic that wealth disparity by and likelihood of being investigated by local authorities by race may have something to do with it and that Epstein and Maxwell had trained their recruiters to try and recruit people who otherwise would be harder to kidnap and disappear than a poor black girl from the ghetto, and thus making the girls he does recruit a, uh, ""more valuable commodity due to scarcity"" is how it would be described in economic terms. We already knew that Epstein and Maxwell focused on catering to wealthy clients but this sort of decision, if that's why they made it, tells us that they know that there's a large market that includes room for less wealthy clients and he, like any capitalist in a market, is focusing on filling a niche. Them avoiding black girls lets us know that they probably have/had trafficking contacts outside of who we know and possibly prior experience trying to appeal to less wealthy clients. 


And there we go, by not going with the easy, shallow answer there's more evidence (through inductive reasoning) that Epstein and Maxwell probably have more trafficking contacts and experience trafficking than we currently know about if their business model has a reason to avoid black girls because there may be a local low end market equivalent of what they do. We already speculated as such but every bit of evidence is another lead and every bit of evidence makes us look less like kooks screaming about Carol in HR. It also helps justify spending taxpayer money on investigations into such matters"
810,fvy94oh,"&gt;In addition, race apparently didn't affect the results of women in this study, but this is never satisfactorily explained in the article;

Honestly, the results aren't satisfactorily explained for any of the outcomes. It's just ""the punishing reach of racism"" while only considering outcomes and inputs.

There are otherof explanations. Black boys are more likely to get in trouble with the law when they're younger and do worse in school than boys of other races. That goes a really long way to setting you up for failure later in life. Now, the school could definitely be racism but that's also not established in the study and Black attitudes towards formal education are so well-known there's memes about acting White if you embrace education. Those attitudes are obviously a reaction to centuries of historical racism and an education system that only cared about inclusion in the last few years, but that doesn't make the importance of education to income any less true.

Maybe what I just wrote is bullshit but it at least attempts to find a cause."
811,fd696xe,"&gt;Feminists demanded mandatory arrest policies in the 1980s in the US, because cops were ""letting men get away with it"". 

You’re confusing domestic violence with child support. In the 80s feminists were demanding mandatory arrest policies for DV after several high profile cases, Look up Francine Hughes, Tracy Thurman, etc. The deadbeat dads law which made failure to pay child support a felony was passed in the mid 90s. 

&gt;As for boys and school, the gap in post-secondary attainment between black boys and black girls is larger than that of other races. 

What does that have to do with the fact that black and Hispanic students are 4-5 times more likely than white studies to be suspended and expelled for the same **disciplinary violations.** were not taking about academics. 

&gt;That doesn't really add up to anti-black bias, since black girls are doing disproportionately better compared to their male peers than white and Asian girls.

You literally just admitted black girls are disciplined more harshly than white girls did you not?

I don’t claim to know the stats in the UK, I’m talking about America."
812,fd9p9jw,"&gt;You’re confusing domestic violence with child support. 

Uh... no, I'm not. And I'm aware of the high profile cases. Such emotionally evocative cases cause knee-jerk overcorrections and are rarely a source of good law and policy. 

We've recently had several judges in Canada rule that a law (passed just a year ago) after a high profile case that spurred tons of public outrage, is unconstitutional. The unconstitutionality of the law was not hidden or subtle--it was glaringly, in-your-face obvious. Yet a parliament full of politicians with law degrees passed it anyway. 

&gt;The deadbeat dads law which made failure to pay child support a felony was passed in the mid 90s.

Not exactly. That was what made willful failure to pay child support a *federal* crime. Prior to that, it was an explicit crime in some state statutes. If it was court ordered, it also qualified as contempt of court. 

&gt;[The first Federal child](https://greenbook-waysandmeans.house.gov/2012-green-book/child-support-enforcement-cover-page/legislative-history) support enforcement legislation was Public Law 81–734, the Social Security Act Amendments of **1950,** which added section 402(a)(11) to the Social Security Act (42 USC 602(a)(11)). The legislation required State welfare agencies to notify appropriate law enforcement officials upon providing Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) to a child who was abandoned or deserted by a parent. 

If refusal to pay child support were not a crime in 1950, there wouldn't be legislation requiring state welfare agencies to involve law enforcement in cases of unpaid child support.

&gt;were not taking about academics.

That part of the conversation started with parahacker bringing up grade discrimination--identical work being graded lower if a boy's name is on it compared to a girl's name, and compared to gender-blinded evaluation. So yes, academics. 

&gt;You literally just admitted black girls are disciplined more harshly than white girls did you not?

Here is what I said: 

&gt;That doesn't really add up to anti-black bias, since black girls are doing disproportionately better compared to their male peers than white and Asian girls.

Perhaps I could have been more clear--when you look at the educational attainment gap favoring girls and break it down by race, the gap is wider between black boys and girls than between white or Asian boys and girls. While a white girl is only 50% more likely to go to college than a white boy, a black girl is 75% more likely to go to college than a black boy.

I would not find it hard to believe that black girls are disciplined more harshly than white girls. However, what I do know is that among all racial groups, boys are disciplined more harshly than girls. Just because there is a race gap does not mean there isn't a gender gap."
813,dlgl90e,"Read through the whole thread so kind of responding to several things.

Sucks that you are getting hate and ones that take it to the racial level. :\ Idk why, At least to me it seems blacks get hated on with higher frequency at random on the internet. If I had a dollar for every slur towards blacks I've seen in a game I might be able to buy myself a fancy Samsung 4k curved Oled tv lol. Outside of that, gay folks get it a lot too I've noticed.


On the topic of race, I'd imagine it could be worse for black girls with the booty thing. Maybe even boobs given how black women are made out to be all busty with all big booties and if not busty then she definitely has a big booty lol. like how black guys have dicks of legend. Shit with the guys they've been recently pushing into the interracial porn seen, shit looks like fuckin hentai brought to real life with as big as some of those dudes are lol. On a positive note (depending on your views of women in porn) more black girls seem to be getting into porn, also boasting different body types but the issue with these stereotypes are that they compound. You not only have the pressures of being a woman or a man but they are further amplified as the bar is raised just because of your race. So you could feel as you fail at being a man/woman and a failure of your race as well. Or simply what you normally would have felt good about yourself had you been any other race you feel like shit because you are black and and blacks are held up to this ridiculous standard that's pushed as if it is just the way things really are.

It is also good to see that you are a black women, which in of itself sucks, the me being glad about your race part, as race shouldn't really matter but given how much sex seems to have been tied to bullshit people have come up with, it does aid in the dismantling of these racist stereotypes. After all black girls are just like any other woman, just maybe a little darker on average so might be better at playing naked ninja lol. True story, my friends and I back in in highschool years back were playing football behind the bleachers during a game at night. (we normally have police in our school at all times) Apparently the police found out and came to make us all stop and send us back to the bleachers or otherwise leave but for whatever reason like instinct I just laid down on the ground when I saw his flashlight, one of my friends (white) copied me and lied down as well. Well long story short after he was done lecturing he noticed my friend and told him to get his ass up, escorted all of them to the bleachers and totally didn't see me as I'm mixed ( I wasn't naked) We were cracking up about it later. 


 I love the girls with small boobs. Flat-small B's. Same with butts, though butts like small-kinda big as I just love butts lol. So many girls being made to feel as if they are inadequate or otherwise lacking when in reality they really truly are not. It sucks, a lot of them feel shitty and to me it is over nothing that they should feel bad for.. if anything feel quite proud of. I don't like when they are the butt of the jokes or don't get the spotlight. I imagine what I feel is a fraction of what those feel that actually have them despite me wishing they didn't feel bad. 

Also titty fucks from small tits look anything but stupid, they are the best &gt;.&lt;  maybe modify your technique for larger guys but that's a pleasure worth trying for. A lot of girls seem to think they can't do it/no one would want them to but good for you, making dreams come true.

Where little black girls are getting kicked out of school for wearing their natural hair. 

For black people, it's way more than hair. Look up tignon laws. Look up how slave owners would shear our hair off and refuse us combs as punishment. Look up how many black women suffer from severe alopecia because of using dangerous chemicals and heat in order to conform to white standards of beauty.

821,ehosczq,"Writer Danielle Young, [@RhapsoDani](https://twitter.com/rhapsodani) has some IMO valuable things to say on #blackboyjoy. This is excerpted from her work for [The Root](https://www.theroot.com/thanks-to-chance-the-rapper-blackboyjoy-is-a-thing-1790856549):

&gt;The climate in America right now is hostile, to say the least. Black men are dying at the hands of authority figures, and witnessing #BlackBoyJoy is a rare, much-needed break from the tragic headlines and hashtags. And let’s be real—the world is highly critical of young black men who express joy. So I want to celebrate this idea that young black men can be happy, too.

&gt;Throughout history, our boys have been denied their childhood. When we learn about the stolen youth of Emmett Till, we’re reminded that young black boys are seen as men by society or, worse, as a threat. #BlackBoyJoy presents a teachable moment to social media that allows us to reclaim the innocence of black boyhood.

&gt;I realize the negative connotation around the word “boy” and recognize the racist history of its use by white supremacists throughout our dismal history. But I did not reach back to the 1800s and yank out the tongues of slave masters to taunt black men with the word “boy”; I wanted to remind all of us that there’s a beauty in black boyhood that’s often ignored and that our boys are forced to be men much too soon. This racist frame of mind is what killed children like Tamir Rice and Trayvon Martin."

823,dwed4wt,"I think black girls are like a black Mercedes with pink upholstery. I will just get it in it whenever I want; drool in it when I want and rub my cock over it when I want. If you were my girlfriend (=slave) I would let you wear something so absurdly tight that your pussy is half exposed and your nipples slip out constantly. While wearing my nice suit, I’d give you tongue kisses in public while everybody is just nodding their heads at you. Nice and uncomfortable, that’s what I like about you!"
824,djabwah,"One of her earliest songs feature her calling herself a slave owner and making a whip crack sound. And there's that ""Pussy"" video where the black boys are oddly sexualised, that video makes my stomach turn."
825,g0hqict,"I believe you are right. Unfortunately though, policies that are advocated for by such people would increase sex trafficking. 

Sex trafficking very rarely starts with a person being snatched off the street against their will. More often than not, it’s a result of a process in which a conman building up trust and then uses that trust to convince the victim to come along willingly. Typical example is that an older man (mid to late 20’s) “meets” a younger girl. He shows her attention, which makes her feel special because he’s a cool older guy. He convinces her that he’s the only one that “understands” her and that other people are just jealous of their relationship. This creates an “us vs them” mentality where the girl starts to think the guy is the only one she can trust. He then convinced her to transgress some minor rules such as not telling her parents where she is or staying out past curfew. And then larger rules such as partaking in certain substances. After pushing this boundary further and further, and her feeling more and more at odds with all her other relationships, he simply comes up with an emergency only she can “fix”. Something like he owes a lot of money and if she could just do this one sexual favor, his debt would be cleared and they could be together. Or he needs to drive to another city but he needs someone to come with him and she’s the only one he can get. This repeats a couple times until it becomes normalized. Some sex trafficking victims realize they are in danger after it’s too late, but a lot of them don’t even realize they were a victim until years after it happens.

All this disproportionately affects minorities. Black girls are already sexualized and seen as adults by the larger culture. Racist policing rarely sees them as victims. When we defund schools and communities, they become more vulnerable. When we make it harder for immigrants to get visas and create an undocumented underclass that can’t go to law enforcement, we make those people more vulnerable. When we defund mental health and criminalize those with mental disease, we make them more vulnerable. When we make it harder for people to get help with addiction, we make those people more vulnerable."
826,fwnvps3,"How is this a Facebook win? There's a lot wrong with this, including phrenology, which is a deeply racist pseudo science. Then there's the discrimination based on common Black hairstyles. This and the assumption that Black girls are adults in children's bodies is a common symptom of white supremacy, where the innocence of Black children is denied and they are assumed to be older, more criminal and more sexual than white children of the same age."
827,fultpo7,"I don't think you are taking into account how systematic racism impacts men differently than it does women. I like to start my analysis of systematic racism in schools. Have you ever looked at the suspension rates and how Black boys are criminalized as children? It really effects their ability to graduate without a record. These boys start getting arrested as preteens before they can even think of graduating high school and applying for college. Black people are not hold the Black community back. I'm not sure how anyone looks at what's going on in America and lay the blame at Black people, men or women."
828,fvmener,"I'm just curious about how you've decided to attribute blame in this instance. If the discussion were about the fact that black boys are more likely to be stopped-and-searched and face criminal action than boys of other ethnicities, would you say that it's due to a culture of criminality in black communities? If not, then why would you say that white boys' underachievement in education is due to a a culture of anti-intellectualism in white working-class communities?"
829,fvmgqjz,Because young black boys are disproportionately the subjects of stop and searches. There have been entire operations that have only targeted ethic minorities and for every criminal they catch holding something that they shouldn't there's a countless number of innocent black men being humiliated and harassed with these searches.
830,fsqt25t,"&gt;Black boys are criminalised from a younger age because of thier race.

By who? Somehow I doubt it's white people tempting young black kids into a life of crime. 

And that's before we even get into why those black kids don't have strong male role models in their lives to stop them turning to a life of crime.."
831,fsrsc3n,"I'm an English teacher for non native speakers so I'm going to expand on this that while it is ostensibly true it isnt in the way nerds who love puns on reddit think.

The typical ""dad joke"" that reddit loves actually dont cut it the way another much better form of wordplay does.

For example the second highest post in r/punpatrol is ""people are usually shocked to find out that I'm a bad electrician."" Now the connection is obviously shocked and electrician. bad electricians get people shocked. This is one dimensional. The book I teach with actually had an entire section on this, and it's actually *the ability to recognize and mock a pun that shows a high level of fluency."" The ""yeah I got all the answers right because they're so obvious and foolish""  shows you have a high enough vocabulary to understand why that pun exists.

This isnt to say worldplay isnt helpful. And in fact wordplay in an of itself does show a high level of fluency. And ironically, the artform with the highest amount of wordplay in terms of helping a student is........hip hop.

Hip hop (when its good) does a level of wordplay that can best be described as the chess to a puns checkers, and because it's a incredibly helpful because it's  listening practice, and listening skills are usually the hardest to master. Let's look at a couple examples that have blown my students mind.

Lil Wayne:""Real g's move in silence like lasagna."" Now this is incredibly complex. One, your first exposure to it is listening. As your processing the information you have to recognize the spelling of lasagna has a silent g. You also have to have a high enough fluency to have some exposure to knowing a g is a fluent shorthand for gangster. You also have to connect ""moving in silence"" to ""acting in a way that isnt immediately observable, the way a criminal would want to act."" This is a triple dimension level wordplay to shock/electricians one.

Heres another one, this one by common: ""my life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it.""

Here you have to recognize that a lot of poetry has a pre-accepted ""scheme"", for example, the sonnet, which then has  further scheme, For example, if it's in iambic pentameter. So here we're dealing with the first definition of scheme, ""a large-scale systematic plan or arrangement for attaining some particular object or putting a particular idea into effect."" Then we deal with the second definition of scheme, ""make plans, especially in a devious way or with intent to do something illegal or wrong"". This also requires cultural context; how many young black boys in bad neighborhoods can only get out through, as has been said, the crime, the rhyme or the hoop. So to say that you have to scheme through your troubles becomes connected to the way young black boys are criminalized, and it feels that your success itself is a crime against a country that does everything in its power to keep you down. In fact, you could say it makes a joke out of you, or a rhyme out of you, something for other people to enjoy at your expense. So ""my life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it."" You could also tie it to, well, the only way to survive is to live inside that rhyme, for your whole life to be a rhyme since it is your only salvation.

Let' go again. J. Cole. ""Ironic that I've been sleeping on the one I've been dreaming about."" OOF, ok, one of the hardest things for no native speakers to learn, yet we English speakers use it everyday. Get up, get down, come up, come down, get with, get around. These terms BAFFLE non native speakers. I have to explain that you have to take the first word as a set up for a secondary definition in the second word. ""Come down."" This implies a verb of movement in a falling or negative sense. They might get it literally, ""come on down!"" but to say I'm coming down off of the medication I was given requires recognizing I'm now speaking about a physical, mental, or emotional state, going from a ""high"" to a  ""low."" This is easy for you, but so is the subjunctive for Spanish speakers, and you try to master that shit. 

So here in J. Cole's song, we can recognize ""sleeping on"" as a literal manifestation, but not have to recognize it's metaphorical implications. ""This new technology will change the world and everyones sleeping on it."" Ah ok, there's no sense of awareness towards it, because when you're asleep, all you know is the dream. This leads to the next part, of ""dreaming about."" This has to be recognized as a phrasal verb to mean ""desires, hopes, future plans."" Again, now were using a phrasal verb in a metaphorical sense. Next, the student has to recognize the irony - that you are not paying attention to someone you in the present perfect (I've) had at one time in the past but perhaps forgotten to pay attention to.

Then you have to recognize what an irony is and why this situation is ironic.

tl;dr you're still a dork for liking puns, and rap is the chess to a puns checkers."
832,fph25pi,I want to add that black boys are particularly adultified. Studies have shown that their teachers and other adults view them as adults and even criminal when they just misbehave in school. No wonder we have such a racial imbalance in our criminal justice system.
833,flnlb5c,"&gt;I’ll focus on #6 because I wholeheartedly disagree.
&gt;
&gt;Education is the best way for us to achieve economic liberation. I’ll use Nigerian Americans as an example. They are the most successful ethnic group in the country. On average making 62,000/yearly. How were they able to accomplish that? Through education. They tend to be in STEM fields and other high earning professions. They are also highly college educated. https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/the-most-successful-ethnic-group-in-the-u-s-may-surprise-you/86885/

Comparing Nigerian immigrants to the whole of native black Americans is not a parallel I agree with at all. For one, in regards to the first step of college admission (there is a bias against native born black Americans for 2nd gen African immigrants.)[https://docdro.id/T7gqvNt] I'm sure this bias extends far past undergraduate admission to post grad programs and the ensuing work force. 

On top of that, you're comparing a group of people who are the middle and upper class of their home countries the the at large population of native black Americans. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Americans

&gt;&gt;The most noticeable exodus occurred among professional and middle-class Nigerians who, along with their children, took advantage of education and employment opportunities in the United States.

Nigerian immigrants are not a cross section of their home populations. It's not the ghettos of Nigeria who are represented in those figures. The immigration process to the US is expensive and selective. If we reverse the situation it would be the same situation of an immigrant group outperforming the native population. Who do you think is more educated, black American expats to Nigeria and Ghana, or the average Nigerian and Ghanaian? It would be the expats, because they have the access and financial power to even get over there in the first place. 

&gt;Let’s dissect the wealth gap for black Americans a little bit. Let’s start in high school. How many black boys graduate from high school yearly? Of that number, how many of those boys go to college? A very small fraction of the total number of 18 year old black boys in the US  goes to college. On average high school graduates make 29,000 while on average college graduate makes 55,000 a year.

This does not account for race. The prior link I posted citing research by The New School and Duke shows the average black highschool graduate makes 3,200 a year. The average black college graduate makes 23,000 a year. 

Furthermore, education leading to wealth is putting the cart before the horse, because wealth is the predictor of who is able to go to college in the first place.

[Yet wealth also plays a role in 
determining who attends college in the first place, and how much 
debt students must take on to get a degree. 7 In effect, education can 
generate a “wealth feedback loop,” as parents’ level of education and 
wealth significantly predicts the level of education their children will 
complete. Thus, the educational and wealth-building opportunities 
directly denied to people of color in past generations continue 
to reverberate in the lives of their children, even those whose 
educational achievements open up opportunities for well-paid 
employment opportunities.](https://www.demos.org/research/asset-value-whiteness-understanding-racial-wealth-gap)


&gt;We can also examine the number of black men in skilled trade work. I had a hard time finding the actual hard numbers, but anecdotal experience is that there aren’t that many black men in blue collar fields. Those fields pay well but are difficult to get into because they are union jobs. Unless you know someone who tells you how to maneuver, those jobs are inaccessible. So by 22 years old many black boys are already behind the curve financially because they either didn’t go to college or pick up a skilled trade. 

Here I will agree that career and technical education programs may be a good idea for black people in lower income situations. I disagree that it will end up putting a dent in the over 100k discrepancy of median white and black wealth. 

&gt;That financial disadvantage is then heightened by making the choice to have multiple children by multiple women. So that 22 y/o making 29,000 has 2 kids and is paying 300/monthly in child support. How much has that black guy loss financially by having 300 withdrawn from his bank account over 10 years? That’s money that he could’ve invested into a 401K or his business.


The vast majority of black men do not have multiple children by multiple women. The number of black men who are fathers between 20-29 are inbetween white and Hispanic males.

[Among men ages 20 to 29, 21.2% of white men, 24.9% of black men, 12.4% of Asian men, and 29.4% of Hispanic men are fathers.](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/mens-fertility.html)

&gt;Now, let’s say that 18 year old black boy goes to his local state school and becomes a nurse. At 22 that black man is making 60,000.  The average nurse makes ~60,000/yearly. When we compare the 22 year old high school graduate vs the 22 year old nurse there is 31,000 difference YEARLY. That’s a 31,000 loss YEARLY to the black community.
&gt;
&gt;let’s say that a black guy works for 5 years as a nurse and decides who wants more education and become a CRNA. The average CRNA makes 160,000/yearly. Let’s say that black man marries an equally yoked black woman who makes 130,000/yearly as a lawyer. There’s household income is 290,000/yearly. Let’s say they have 2 kids and live in a middle class black neighborhood in NC. Your telling me that middle class black family won’t impact their local economy when they shop local and buy groceries in their neighborhood? Your telling me they if 1 million black men entered STEM fields where the average person makes six figures that won’t help the wealthy gap?

I'm not saying there will literally be no change in wealth gap. I'm saying it will not be significant. All of this is assuming it happens in a vacuum. It's not accounting for, criminal records and how that may affect employment. If this hypothetical child gets even as much as a marijuana charge at any age he is an adult, the whole plan goes up in smoke. And let's say he does everything according to plan that's not a guarantee it will work out for him, you can see how that played out in 2008 

&gt;We all know the system is set up against us BUT if we chose careers that are high earning individually there would be a collective impact. The issue is many black boys would rather chase fame and money via sports and entertainment then go into “boring” fields like accounting, engineering, and science.

I don't think there will be a literal zero impact, I think you're overstating the impact. 

[Racial disparities in wealth are not a result of individual or family choices but rather the result of structural racism in American public policy. Many government programs designed to expand access to homeownership, higher education, fair wages, and union protections have largely benefited white households, allowing them to build and transfer wealth across generations, while Black households were systematically excluded.](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2019/08/07/473117/simulating-progressive-proposals-affect-racial-wealth-gap/#fn-473117-4) 

If economic trends stay the same, it will take [228 years](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-average-black-family-would-need-228-years-to-build-the-wealth-of-a-white-family-today/) for a black family to reach the same level of wealth as a white family. And if there is not sweeping government intervention, the gap will never close. No amount of individual choice will make any meaningful long-term impact. I don't believe 1 million new black men making 200k in a population of 37,144,530 black people is enough capital to change this trend."
834,fc3m5y4,"This case is an example of male violence, however, the fact that he chose to predate on black girls is relevant, since those girls have the least police protection. Black girls are more likely to be adultified in the eyes of the law, treated as adult criminals and charged with prostitution when they are trafficked children."
835,fbtxe7t,"Yes, it’s a genuine disagreement. Black boys are dying and murdering at alarming rates and you’re more worried about Salvadorans. When kids come into our schools not speaking English do you think that helps or hurts the black literacy rates (80% of Black boys are coming out of LA high schools unable to read)? 

And you need to stop conflating immigrants and illegal aliens. Legal immigrants have a lower crime rate than natives because we vet them and do not let criminals in. 

It’s not a coincidence that our government hasn’t been tracking the legal status of those incarcerated. Now that they’re starting to, we now know we’ve been lied to about how much better behaved illegal aliens are than Americans. They aren’t and they honestly can’t be when they’re breaking our laws from the moment they sneak in to get free healthcare, free schooling, and cash for their labor that they can send home. 

We have been sacrificing our (mostly black) children’s educations, safety and economic health by allowing illegal immigration for decades. We’re done. You have more empathy for other nations’ citizens than your own. I’m the opposite. The black community are real victims. And they’re American and I will continue to cheer when I see a plant go from 90% Latino, then get busted by ICE and go to 60% black workers staring at $12/hour. The media can tell me all day and night that black people are too lazy to want those jobs, but I know better. And I suggest you consider that maybe the powers that be want that cheap labor more than they want Americans to do well and prosper and have safe communities and high literacy rates. I want the billions that we spend on illegal aliens to go toward Americans. If you want to take a family in and completely support them, you have my full support. Demanding the rest of us to support anyone who can manage to sneak in at the expense of black America is completely amoral and we’re the majority and it’s a huge part of why people elected Trump and while he’ll get a larger percentage of the black vote in 2020."

CBS NEWS November 18, 2019, 12:00 PM

**Documentary explores ""pattern of violence against black girls"" in schools**

**Black girls are punished more at school**

Video: 05:25 *Black girls are punished more at school*


*Time and time again, we've seen disturbing videos of school resource officers and teachers using violence to punish young black girls. As part of our School Matters series, we spoke to a 13-year-old who says she was dragged outside and left in the cold by her teacher in the second grade.*

Extreme punishment of black girls in schools is more common than you may think. 


According to a 2017 study by the National Women's Law Center, black girls are more than five times more likely to be suspended than white girls and are six times more likely to be expelled.


Samaya Dillard, 13, and her family are not surprised by those numbers. Samaya's story was featured in a new documentary called ""Pushout: The Criminalization of Black Girls in Schools.""

&gt; ""I was basically bullied, or felt bullied, by my teacher,"" Samaya told CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan.


She said in second grade, an argument with another student led to her teacher dragging Samaya outside.

&gt; ""She then grabbed my chair that I was sitting in and dragged me across the room to the door and sat me outside,"" Samaya recounted.

&gt; ""And this was the day before Christmas break,"" her father, Jason Dillard, added.

&gt; ""And then what happens?"" Duncan asked.     &gt; ""So I just decided to leave,"" Samaya said.

Their story made the local news in Sacramento. 

&gt; ""You were near a freeway. In the documentary you say, 'Everything could be easier if I just jumped,'"" Duncan said. 

&gt; ""Yeah,"" Samaya responded.

&gt; ""You thought about ending your life at the age of 7?""

&gt; ""Yes,"" Samaya said. 

She said she felt confused and helpless.

Samaya's parents settled a lawsuit against the school and the teacher. The school district issued a statement saying, in part: 

&gt; ""We hope that her story, and the stories of others will help other districts as it continues to help us.""

It's stories like Samaya's that pushed educator and author Monique W. Morris to raise awareness through the documentary.
&gt; ""You really begin to pick up on the stories across the country. You start to recognize that this is actually a pattern of violence against black girls,"" Morris said.


At the heart of the disparities, Morris said she thinks

&gt; ""black girlhood and womanhood is constructed by these ideas in our society — of them being hypersexual, of them being loud and angry.""   
The film was screened last month at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and will air on PBS next year.
&gt; ""I want people to walk away from this documentary understanding, number one, that our girls are not disposable… and to really think about how we can shift our understanding of what constitutes a bad attitude or sassiness or combativeness,"" Morris said. 

Mo Canady, from the National Association of School Resource Officers, acknowledges there is a problem. &gt; ""We are training our officers to go into the school environment and to realize that implicit bias exist, even their own, and how to combat that,"" Canady said. 

&gt; ""At the end of the day, a good SRO really should want to have a positive impact on the lives of students.""     Psychologist Tyffani Monford Dent hopes to make that positive impact.

&gt; ""School systems need to begin to identify prevention strategies and actually buy into them,"" Dent said.

Having worked in juvenile correctional facilities, she now organizes in school group therapy sessions for girls outside Cleveland, Ohio. 

&gt; ""We also need to show black and brown kids that we care about them being here, that the goal is not to push you out of the school system,"" Dent said.

Morris said the relationship between schools and black communities need to be repaired.      ""I fundamentally believe that schools need to be locations for healing, so that they can be the locations for learning,"" Morris said.


Samaya hopes one of the takeaways people have from the film is: 

&gt; ""We are people too, and that we want to be heard. … Black girls are loved and sacred.""


Morris said she has interviewed more than 150 girls, educators, and justice professionals and visited more than 30 communities throughout her career doing this research."
837,f8wsgy0,"Your link is only about federal cases. It doesn't  over state cases and criminal courts, which comprise the largest burden of mass incarceration.

I am not at my computer right now, but I've seen the arrest and detention stats for victims of child sexual exploitation (white girls are diverted through social services while black girls are arrested, detained, and incarcerated) and re drug cases. I'll find the papers later if I remember."
838,f6w5i1p,"Bruh, I'm not someone claiming cultural appropriation but I don't think it's respectful to dismiss African American sentiment. It's not right. especially any black person claiming cultural appropriation. It's the same, fuck the minority believes that led to the genocide of 6mill jews. The problem that black people have is not that culture is being exchanged. Go to an event, go ahead immerse yourself. African Americans love seeing other cultures join in on festivities. However, they have always been limited in how they can manifest their own culture in many countries around the world and are always met with negative connotations. Black girls are always too loud to certain people. Black boys will always be criminals. Appropriation in most cases means blatant stealing and relabeling. Like the Kardashians and European girls rocking breads, getting lip and butt injection, and wishing they had darker skin like... To look like what standard of beauty? if not African american. They will never say my best friend who is black inspired me, It will always the Kylie Jenner challenge."

Women-of-Color-Behind-Bars_Intro and Juvenile Sentencing

Disparities in Juvenile Sentencing

The demographics of America’s women prisoner population are extreme, but not surprising, considering the discrimination that occurs at each level of the justice system. This kind of racial disparity doesn't happen overnight.

New data gathered by the Sentencing Project, a Washington D.C.-based research center, indicates that discrimination starts early. Racial disparities in female sentencing are present even in juvenile courts. Like their older counterparts, girls (aged 12-17) of color are more likely to be incarcerated than white girls. African American girls are 3.5 times more likely to end up in a juvenile justice facility than white girls, while Native American girls are 4 times more likely to be imprisoned. Roughly 134 out of 100,000 Native American girls will be incarcerated at some point, compared to 110 out of 100,000 African American girls and 32 out of 100,000 white girls.""

If you're into reading physical books, you can always pick up the Black Girl Pushout(https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/473718/) to view how criminalization of black girls starts very early and read more on the fact that black girls are *rarely* if ever treated like children as you so broadly claim. 

Perhaps you need to rewatch how black women are repeatedly brutalized my police and other law enforcement for talking back or how black girls are body slammed at schools and at pool parties, while I can probably count on my fingers openly belligerent white women have been poorly treated. Or the fact that we're looking at a trial for an openly racist white woman being hand held while I dare you to find anything similar happening to a black woman or othet woman of color for lesser crimes?.

There are a plethora of easily Googable and verified sources proving *my point* that the only women who get coddled at all in the justice system are *WHITE. WOMEN.* Certainly not black women and other women of color. *You're * objectively incorrect sir."
841,ewyizf2,"You make some good points here. Beyonce is definitely portrayed as an untouchable goddess, on par with the greats like Aertha Franklin and Dianna Ross, but she does not make herself very available to the public. I don't know if that's intentional or not, but it does contribute to the perception of her as a cold black woman. I'm not sure how fair that perception is, though. I've always gotten the sense that she's much warmer in private than her public image makes her seem.

I can't say I've ever felt she didn't want me as a fan, though. I think it's more a case of her music simply not being made for me because I am white. Which is totally fine, in my opinion. Black girls are criminally underserved in nearly every form of media. If Beyonce wants to fill that void, I'm all for it."
842,eyvfbvs,"A part of what bothers me about people making arguments to ""emphasize for CC!"" is the fact that, beyond just having a baseline empathy for all human experiences in general, it's actually another layer of her privilege. It reminds me of the discourse on how young black boys are often portrayed as ""men,"" in the media, a narration that has been use to justify the killings of Tamir Rice (12 years old) and Trayvon Martin (17 years old). Meanwhile, white criminals such as Brock Turner (19 years old at time of crime), and Brett Kavanaugh get to have their exploits emphasized as the folly of youth, of being a boy. The question must be posed: who gets to be a boy in America? And who must be a man? 

So in terms of extending the benefit of the doubt to Caroline, I think what draws a lot of us to this snark, and certainly a huge part of what draws me, is her absolute flaunting of her layers of privilege. Her White privilege, her wealth privilege (yes, wealth privilege, even though she may not be a trust fund baby, she went to Exeter, she went to NYU, she went to Cambridge, and she has had that apartment in the West Village for 8 years - all without any income? You can't tell me there isn't a bit of wealth/consistent access to money going on there), her class privilege, all of these things ALLOW HER the benefit of the doubt. When it is encouraged that we cut her some slack, it is to say that SHE DESERVES SLACK. But who deserves slack in America? Who deserves chance and chance and chance again? Who is allowed to fail? 

These issues, are of course, bigger than herself, and it is not fair to pin them on her, which I'm not actually doing. But her insistence of her ""young gorl""-ness is, I'd posit, an insertion of her whiteness and privilege to label HERSELF and be safe in doing so, she is cloaking herself in her privilege, at the expense of those who cannot afford to.

This is done in multiple areas.

For example, when it comes to talking about a child's right to have an abortion, you will often see 'young women' used as well.  When it comes to talking about how black boys are punished by the criminal system, you can almost guess the publications view just by seeing if they use 'boys', 'teens', or 'young men'.  When it comes to letting 17 year olds votes, 'young adults' is very common.  When it comes to teens who are victims of crimes, 'children' is common, but when the teen is the perpetrator, 'teen' is far more often used."

So you're presenting an argument that I didn't as mine, then disproving it, then going on to say it proves your point? That's a stunning strawman my dude. The reason I didn't give that argument is because it wasn't an example of institutionalised racism. Please do not put words into my mouth.

&gt;Youre just looking at disparities and saying it just be racism.

Okay, answer me this - Where do you think we of these disparities come from?

1. Do you think that college educated black people prefer lower paying jobs than non-educated white people? Why do less qualified white people make more than more qualified black people? What could it possibly be?

2. Why do you think that white applicants with criminal histories are more likely to get callbacks than black applicants with no criminal histories? What possible explanation is there for this ""disparity""?

3. Why do you think that black people receive inferior medical care to white people? Explain this ""disparity"".

4. Why do people think that young black girls are less innocent and need less protection? Why this ""disparity""?

5. Why do realtors show black homebuyers less houses in less neighborhoods? Why this ""disparity""?

6. Why do black defendents get longer and stricter punishments for similar crimes? Your explanation was ""more likely to have priors"". You still haven't provided any research to back that up. Is is just your gut feeling?

7. Why is there such a high proportion of unarmed black women being shot by law enforcement? Why this ""disparity""?

8. You can see where I'm going with this. There's plenty more, but if you provided satisfactory explanations for these 7 points, it'd be a good start.


Your problem is that you're way to invested in your worldview to let facts change your mind. Your response to this discussion is emotional, not rational.

I'll extend an invitation once again though - answer these questions I have presented to you, and back any claims you make with research or evidence.

It shows how racism still deeply affects African-American men’s lives, even if they grow up in the country’s richest neighborhoods and have high levels of education.

860,dru7x1z,"Comparing individuals to other individuals will always inevitably bring you to different conclusions, every time.  Because every individual and their circumstances will be different to every other individual - even within the same groupings of race/ethnicity, culture, religion, sexualities etc.  But it's not about the individual vs the individual, it's about the group vs the group.  
One black family can have it way better than one white family, but, predominately, black people as a group have it worse than white people as a group for numerous reasons in numerous ways.  Even if somehow magically every black family was able to make bucket loads of money, legally, that still doesn't mean very much in other areas.  Having more money doesn't take away the fact that a black person can be assumed to be a criminal just for existing and may get shot for no reason at all.  It doesn't change the fact that black girls are highly sexualised in the media and thus in the minds of white people everywhere, and this translates to action and how we treat those black girls.  It doesn't change the fact that a group of white men is more likely to lynch a black girl than a group of anyone is to lynch a white girl.  It doesn't change the fact that some medical institutions are less likely to seriously treat a black person than a white person (or more likely to have the family investigated so the child is removed from the family and the family is considered neglectful or even abusive when they aren't).

All of the things that can make a person privileged or unprivileged don't cancel each other out.  A white person can be poor, and so financially be less privileged than a rich black person.  But the black person will always be less privileged than the white person when it comes to racism and how racism (even when it isn't anti-black, but simply pro-white) can extend into other areas such as law, sex, safety and so much more.  Even the most downtrodden white person who is unprivileged in every aspect of life (money, sex, sexuality, religion, educational status) is still a white person who is more privileged than a black person when we look at race.  Maybe only in that one single area are they more privileged, but it's still a privilege - and maybe they don't notice the privilege of not being black, but it still exists, because the black person will never be able to not notice that they lack that privilege.  And yes the black person may be more privileged than that downtrodden white person in every other way, but it doesn't remove their one disadvantage.  

The point is to not compare one type of privilege with another, is being poor worse than being black? Is being gay worse than being poor? Is whatever worse than the other thing? That isn't really the point and it probably doesn't matter what is worse and what isn't.  The point is to recognise all the different ways we can be privileged or disadvantaged and then to find ways to make these things not exist anymore.  We can work on more than one problem at a time, but we don't have speak about all of them at the same time.

Like #MeToo.  Didn't you know men get raped too? We all know that is not what MeToo was about, and mentioning that men get raped when speaking about women getting raped is derailing and silencing.  But this doesn't mean we don't care about men getting raped, that we don't think that needs to be stopped as well.  It just means it is not relevant to the discussion at hand.  So rich black families? Not relevant to the fact that little black girls have been given a bad hand in life."

I spent a good 3 years working in 3 different low income middle schools in my area while I was still considering becoming a teacher. 

I don't think that white women in education are the problem, I think that *women* in education are the problem. Specifically the fact that there are just way, way too many of them in the education system.

The schools I worked at had a vast majority of black female teachers but the problems were still apparent. The boys in class would receive different treatment than the girls. The girls would be held as the model of good behavior and the boys would be given a much, much shorter leash when it came to discipline. They would often come to me complaining about the way they would get treated. 

So basically what would happen is the young black boys (the schools were almost entirely black) were basically already being treated as criminals from the moment they got into the classroom. But what's funny is that in the classes I worked in where there were black male teachers, the boys would actually make so much progress and they'd be treated fairly, while the girls who would normally get away with acting up all the time would actually get in trouble when they deserved it.

869,fxfvtfc,""" The racism is in thinking all other black girls will be ""too ghetto."" If I encounter a few racist white people and then say all white people are racist, that's hardly fair of me, right? Same thing here. Saying all black girls are ""too ghetto"" because those you've met were ""too ghetto"" is inherently racist because it involves generalizing about a racial group based on a small sample and no additional evidence. ""  
Now, to be fair, if we accept the exact wording of what he said you might actually have a point-but I doubt he actually really thinks black people, by virtue of the color of their skin, are all universally ghetto. I mean, we already have blatant proof of this via multiple black people who are popular-nobody would call, say, Terry Crews ""ghetto"". And, as I said, from what I've observed about the son so far I don't really take him as being that foolish, either.

"" For the most part, I think that's fair to say. However, I doubt she would put such specific words into the son's mouth like that.  ""

If you were ideologically motivated to fight all forms of racism you could find, real or imagined(and I do mean IMAGINED), it'd be easy for ""black girls are too ghetto for me"" to become ""**All** black girls are too ghetto for me"" via reinterpretation, rather than interpreting it as ""Black girls are too ghetto for me **in general**"". These 'Antiracist' types tend to be extremely prone to ideologically motivated confirmation bias, as is elaborated on in [this](https://newdiscourses.com/2020/01/identity-politics-civil-rights-movements/) article.

"" Of course not. I never said they are. The racism isn't just in making a generalization; it's in making a generalization about a racial group based on a small sample.""

A generalization is typically not a hardcore rule that is always true, but an association based on observed reality. What he is saying is not that black girls are always ghetto by virtue of their skin color, but that being black and having a ghetto demeanor have a strong association in his experience. Making an association between A and B is not racist, otherwise the statistics you showed me earlier would be indeed racist, but insisting A **always** leads to B probably is. I'm skeptical the son actually went to the latter assumption.

"" In fact, stereotypes often come about as a way for those in power to remain in power and oppress others. Take, for example, the stereotypes of black people as unintelligent and uncivilized that were used to justify slavery. ""

And you're saying there is a faceless council of white people hidden away somewhere perpetuating this specific generalization, instead of it being passively perpetuated by the degree of truth it DID hold? 

&amp;#x200B;

"" Show me the statistics that prove that black girls are ""too ghetto."" For that matter, how would you even define or measure how ""ghetto"" a person is? That's just nonsensical; it's a charged and derogatory term. ""

If ghetto is associated with poor, and black people are disproportionately poor... connect the goddamn dots. Of course there isn't empirical evidence on this subject, so really it's a matter of opinion to everyone, though we're certainly free to argue about it. I just believe the associations are painfully self-evident.

"" Encouraging a friend or family member to do something new is not indoctrination. He said no, and so he didn't have to go. He wasn't being forced to go. Introducing someone to new people is not indoctrination and, again, he had the choice to say no, which he did. ""

You seriously don't believe a girl who was raised by a political activist, introduced him to things in a manner people in that ideological camp would likely do, and even went as far as to try to invite him to a rally for the same cause her mom is a political activist for, was trying to manipulate him in some capacity? It doesn't stop being attempted indoctrination because there is no lethal force involved.

"" Also, the BLM protests should hardly be considered 'political.' People are just asking for rights and equality. ""  
The very fact that you trivialize the BLM movement down to that speaks volumes. They're speaking out against a perceived, *not proven*, injustice and claiming police racism where none is immediately evident. 'Just asking for rights and equality' **does not begin** to describe the situation surrounding them.

They will also call you racist for suggesting all lives matter, because according to them anything that goes against their dogma is racist.

"" That intent doesn't seem clear to me at all. It seems you're just trying to read in some anti-white narrative when there is none.""

I realize this one might make your head spin, but BLM is inherently identitarian, choosing to **accentuate** racial identities(""support Black businesses"" ""Listen to Black voices"") rather than trying to erode their significance as MLK did. The entire concept of [Acting White](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-acting-white/) is blatant proof of trying to reinforce a racial identity (which is hilariously itself a fucking stereotype, one they show their belief in as they shit-talk Terry Crews on Twitter) in a false us-vs-them setup. Considering the cult-like manner in which Antiracism operates, it's not that hard to see."
870,fye7s4g,"The girl was already hit once, I guarantee you she expected it again and swung first when the other girl got in their space. I agree, it’s idiotic, you don’t give a group of aggressive assholes anymore reason to hit you again but the black girls are 100% the aggressors here based on the video evidence above."
871,ftqngef,"You want the lowest rung of respect in American society, the black woman. She is violently confronted by police, ignored by 'polite' society, and overly disciplined in school for 'attitude' problems. The level of racist hate towards Venus, Serena, Michelle, Michelle's daughters, among others is despicable. BTW, the things I mentioned are all things I have witnessed play out in front of my own eyes. It probably shouldn't shock anyone that BLM and these protests are driven, in a very large part, by black women.

I was reading a story about a black girl in Alaska who, after destroying all of her competitors in a swimming race, was then disqualified after the fact. Her offense? The team issued swimsuit she was wearing showed too much of her butt. Despite white girls who, showed the same percentage of skin, but had a different body type. How embarrassing for her! But it speaks to a deeper problem. If black boys are assigned overly mature and aggressive traits for their age (as is described by many articles), leading them to be punished for offenses based on a level of maturity they can't possibly have; black girls have a different problem. They can be perceived as overly precocious when their age and maturity preclude it almost entirely. Neither of those situations are fair, but they go back to the same problem, white people interpret black children as older than they are. So that black girl, she wasn't simply a competitor who had an ill fitting suit, she was a potential seductress using her body as a sexual tool - instead of an athletic one. Just like the black boy, he wasn't just screwing around, he was *menacing*, in a way that portends worse problems down the road, so he must be punished. Somehow, when it comes to black kids, the urge to punish is abnormally strong.

I can't cite all of the studies, but if you google ""age and maturity perception by race"" you will get many, many, many hits. It is such a profound issue in education that we are just starting to get our heads around this. Some school districts have implemented a board whose only job is to evaluate suspensions without the student's name or sex because black kids are prominently suspended or expelled for offenses that would not expel or suspend white kids."
872,fuv2zxm,"&gt;eg Black men are often perceived to be more dangerous, which leads police to act more aggressively in case anything goes down.)

This is the same with early childhood education. My books(Going to college for ECE management-heavy on the equality) have said that black boys are generally seen as more aggressive and thus get in trouble for things that they shouldn't. Yes, I know that's bullshit. Going by that means that we as teachers should allow black children to be more aggressive but not white boys.

&amp;#x200B;

The 15/50 is the same for ECE too. Though black kids make up for less than 20% of the preschool population,they make up 50% of the suspensions. Yes, suspensions in *kindergarten*."
873,ftpv62c,"Those girls were always rewarded, too. They are racist and aggressive one minute, then poor innocents who just need everyone to stop being so mean to them! Cue some tears, and they get exactly what they want. And the editors make sure it looks like the black girls are loud and aggressive and rude."
874,fr3nl0r,"  I thought I already established that being around any kind of man of any race isn't safe, but I'm not going to pretend like black men aren't really aggressive.

I just feel like a lot of black men are more aggressive towards black women and girls because they know 9 times out of 10 they'll get away with it. There's so many black women and girls missing and not a whole lot of people care. We're really the most disrespected. The majority of black girls are sexually assaulted before the age of 18. There's way too many stories of black girls getting molested by one of their male family members and the family ignoring it or their mother turns around and beats them. The not all black men thing isn't really useful if it seems like the majority of them are predatory."
875,fs3jadc,I really hate how black girls are portrayed as aggressive. Like yes there are some girls who act aggressive but it doesn't represent the majority
876,fsvoeyl,"Saying there is a masculinity problem, doesn't make the racism go away.
Also: 

A 2014 report released by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund found that although black and white girls have similar rates of misconduct, black girls are subjected to arrest far more often. These disparities result from and perpetuate false stereotypes that black girls are inherently aggressive, sexually deviant, threatening and dangerous, and not deserving of empathy, nurturing and attention.

Again not saying there isn't a masculinity problem. But pls, can we talk about racism? Just once? (you don't have to answer, I'm done)

878,fbqupvi,"Naw, it’s racist. It harkens back to the belief that black men are more sexually aggressive than others, especially towards whites women. That’s where they hit the whole large penis stereotype. It’s physical proof of their sexuality (black women face this as well. People assume that black girls are more sexually mature than others, even at a very young age). Plus, there’s that “defilement” element.

Ain’t American racism fun?"
879,fcndvzc,"Yes one thing they had in common was how passive aggressive they were. There was this one guy I had huge  crush on. He was really my type physically but he was so sensitive for no reason. He did tell me he was bullied when young, but he was 27 when I met him. He’s old enough to control his defensiveness and he couldn’t. Then he wouldn’t hesitate to say things like black girls are unattractive or very racist things. I still remember what he said of Cuba. I asked him if he used tinder there and in which he replied “ ofc not, girls there are really poor and I know that they’d do anything for money”.  I was shocked but didn’t say anything."

black women physically have the highest

testosterone levels of any women. There are black

girls at my gym who can lift more than Asian men.

No man wants a testy or angry woman.

Also, black women tend to be in worse health than

other women, physically and emotionally. Plus,

everyone knows how much black women worship

slut culture, it's very likely any black girl you date

has been gangbanged, sandwiched, etc, used up

by her early 20's. There's a reason roast beef pussy

and black women are synonymous

Also, black girls are picky and blunt. I commonly

see obese black girls talking about above average

men as if they are on the same level. They are less

appreciative because they follow social media so

heavily.

TLDR: Black women are less feminine, less

appealing to look at for obvious reasons (hair, lip,

noses), are the most aggressive and also there's

the psycho risk where if something goes wrong

hooking up she 'goes ghetto', which happened

to me the only time I allowed a black woman to

date me. It's not even racism, it's observation of

behaviors. Raise better women if you wanted to be

treated like better women. Black women complain-

ing nobody wants them is like a Toddler smashing

a cake and complaining how he can't eat it.

883,ezagv54,"theres a difference between typecasting based on personality and typecasting based on race. Day and Kemi are very different, but Kemi said they explicitly tried to make her play into the stereotype, meaning casting/production thought that they were similar. They also went out of their way to make Kemi seem rude when she was just quiet, and used her most aggressive DRs. 

plus, when it comes to representation, numbers are a big deal. if they cast more black people then it wouldnt be a big deal if some of them are typecast. It's fine that some of the white people are typecast because theres 12 white (or white passing) people with very different personalities, so no one thinks that a personality trait is due to their race. Meanwhile, racists in bumfuck nowhere who dont know any black people irl will see how every year the 1 black girl they cast has certain similar character traits, and that will just reinforce their subconscious belief that all black girls are like that."
884,ezstqu5,"This girl is probably retarded or something, but why do people feel the need to become physical.. Black girls are always so aggressive.. fuck off"
885,et49775,"The problem is A LOT of times in the black community especially men do bash dark skin women. Most of the time honestly and they try to defend themselves by saying its a preference. I'm not going to lie I might I have a preference for light skin men.... I've dated dark skin dudes, brown skin dudes, and light skin dudes but usually the light skin guys were the ones I liked the best If I'm being completely honest maybe its coincidental I'm not sure. But I don't go around announcing to every two seconds that I like light skin guys way better like a lot of black men do. The only reason why I even noticed that I might like light skin guys better is because a friend pointed out to me that recently all the guys I've been dating have been light skin but its not like I think to myself.... hmmm he's light skin so automatically he's better. Dark skin women are constantly disrespected you know this. They play songs on the radio with black men calling them roaches and black bitches but talking about how they love those redbones.... Not to mention the prejudice that comes with being dark skin too a lot of men even claim that dark skin women are too aggressive and ghetto etc to date. Its ridiculous. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm from New York where there are a lot of afro latinos and its so interesting because you'll see a dark skin black girl acting angry and crazy and suddenly all black girls are like that but then you'll see a light skin puerto rican afro latina acting the same way and all of a sudden its sexy and she's feisty. I mean come on....

&amp;#x200B;

Date who you want to date I don't care but its really intellectually dishonest to pretend that A LOT of these black men aren't out here bashing dark skin girls. If thats JUST your preference why do you need to make tweets every other day degrading them. And a lot of these dudes really are fucking dark skin girls on the low but a light skin girl is a status symbol."
886,ej0lnfl,"It really is a two sided thing. 
On one hand, I've been straight up told bluntly by clients ""I only get dances from white girls."" ""Black girls are too aggressive"" ""A lot of black dancers look manly."" ""You are really pretty for a black girl."" etc etc.

On another hand, I've had a customer of color (who was an absolute sweetheart) ask for a particular girl, and she wouldn't dance for him if her life depended on it simply because he was black and begged me to dance for him instead. I've even heard a girl mentoring another newer girl explaining why she never dances with Mexicans/Indians/Foreigners/etc and that she should do the same. "
887,ek9ca9g,"That’s the reason I watch reality TV.

From my experience growing up in a white neighborhood as a black girl, a key difference I’ve noticed is the amount of sheltering about race. We as black girls are made very aware of race from day 1. We’ve been told by our parents and elders how much our race is going to affect our lives negatively and hold us back (reflecting on this, I think this really harms black children’s potential in ways). We’re told we have to be aggressive and fight hard for everything we want in life. I think we also learn to live life on the defense, anticipating attack and pushback.

However, many white girls get the privilege of NOT being made aware of these things. This means they can go through life with a sense of confidence and a carefree attitude (which we in the black community view as entitlement.) This confidence is very helpful in a lot of ways, and can making connections and advancing in society much easier. But it also means when they are faced with racial conflict it is intimidating and jarring.

I personally wish that more black girls were afforded the opportunity to be a bit more sheltered, so we can have the same kind of confidence. I think the “Carefree Black GirI” movement needs to make a comeback. There needs to be balance."
888,eh5auzd,"I can totally do that. 

Black girls are naturally more aggressive. 

Done. "
889,e87tdq6,"Wooooo boy I wanna get into this one.

So black women get the brunt of the black man's stereotype; aggressive, masculine, strong. So people outside see us as such and we are considered to be the least feminine group of women. In the black community the darker your skin the less likely you are first to get chosen... Not only that but essentially you are competing with non-black women, mixed women, and light skinned women. So black men are dumping on you because you're too dark, society is dumping on you because you don't fit the standard of beauty and don't get me started on what it's like to be black and then decide that ""since black men won't love me, I'm gonna broaden my pool"". The entire black community will dump on your ass if you think of getting with a non-black man and call you a race traitor or a bedwench.

A lot black girls are brainwashed to only date black men which is why we are less likely to interacially date while black men are the ones least likely to marry and when they do most likely to marry interacially."
890,e5kuoc3,"TEA! Posts like this give me flashbacks of high school. I attended a predominantly hispanic school, but it still had a sizeable non-latino black population. The black and Latino boys loved to clown black girls and then go hug up on their latina girlfriends. There were times when they were confronted about the comments they make about black girls and that always led to dating preferences. They (the black and latino boys) always said something along the lines that black girls were loud, aggressive, and had bad attitudes when questioned about why they weren't open to dating black girls. Funny enough it wasn't very rare to see an angry latina smacking and pushing her boyfriend around when she got pissed. The latinas were just as loud as the black girls, and the majority of the fights that occurred at school was between them. :/ It is weird how they get fetishized for their anger while black girls are constantly looked down upon. "
891,e38ddj0,"As someone in an interracial relationship herself, I have no issue with black guys dating other ethnicities. My issue is always with some black guys having to shit on black women as a reason to date other ethnicities. 
Also how their excuses are always rooted in stereotypes. Like nerdy black guys complaining that black girls are either too aggressive or not checking for them because they aren’t stereotypically masculine. But they are always going for the same type of black woman. It’s like saying the same about white women not liking nerds but you are always hitting on the “vapid, cheerleader type.” There is a myriad of black women just like every other race. I’ve met just as many controlling types as i have met meek ones. 

I’m not gonna pretend that they aren’t black women who shit on guys in interracial relationships but I think most of it comes as a defence mechanism after being told over and over they are the least desirable. If all the other groups reject us, we’re just left with our own, and when they reject us too..."
892,e3nv161,"Besides the stats its logical. American white girls are almost all trash thots with zero homemaking skills or personality besides pop culture and slutdom, but theyre hot. Asian girls from america are typically the same BUT have a white hot fever and are perceived to be more traditional because of asian family stereotypes from hollywood and asiatic countries. Black girls are overly masculine and aggressive besides having the highest rates for stds and out of wedlock birth stats so almost no one wants them. Latinas are hit or miss theyre either literal goblins or very beautiful but both of them will have the biggest bitch personality possible, they will have the highest rate of homemaking skills though (at least in terms of cooking)."
893,e2jo4en,"Awakened early on for sure. Colorism is intricately related to romantic value, which smacks everyone (but particularly girls) in the face around middle school. Other aspects of colorism such as dark skin perceived as dangerous or aggressive are something that we generally attribute to black men, but black women also experience the brunt of that starting young (nationally, black girls are 4 times more likely to be suspended than white girls). So it’s complicated, but it’s not. You see what the boys like which is usually light skinned girls with a particular type of hair. And the boys like them because they see how the world values them diffently. Proximity to whiteness is intoxicating, it fucks everyone up. 

Even the “inoffensively brown” girls (Kerry Washington/Gab Union) often come from a light mom and darker dad. So the examples are at home and everywhere. 

Tips: literally look at more dark skinned people / women. I went down a rabbit hole a few years ago looking at dark skinned Instagram pages, and the only thing I left with was “black women are fucking GORGEOUS, these dudes out here a nuts.” Expose yourself, otherwise you can’t see the variations and therefore beauty. You have to go out of your way, just like black women, to see black women’s beauty represented. Then you’ll start to realize how much looking at these pages and sites affects how you feel and your “preference,” how easy it shifts. Then you’ll get angry because you can see how much of a head start other type of women had. "
894,dzetbq7,"Lol ? Black girls are the most outright sexually aggressive girls especially towards White men that straight up say they want to be bred by White men so their kid is cute with good hair. The black community acknowledges it all the time and say ""dat deh black women give White men better treatment then den dey own men."""
895,dwwmt6p,"I can see it from both sides, on one hand there has always been a narrative where black girls are perceived as more aggressive/confrontational just because they're black. And the other queens shouldn't be telling Vixen to tone it down if they're not also going to say the same thing to Aquaria. But on the other hand, it's not Aquaria's fault how she reacts to things, including when she cries, and however Vixen believes she will be perceived, and how she is actually perceived is not Aquaria's fault, it's a societal problem. But to me, I don't think either was more confrontational, they were both being equally as bitchy to each other."
896,durhhb9,"Here it is , the classic asian who knows that not every asian man is feminine but will not hesitate to call all black people aggressive. Apparently black girls are incapable of being virgins or calm. "
897,dvh9twh,"Dude, fuck off. You know damn right black girls are louder, ruder, more brash and aggressive than a group of Asian girls. Stop being a fucking bro and let’s talk the truth here."
898,ds6fife,"A lot of asian girls in Anglo countries tend to have a form of internalised racism where they tend to believe that white is best. It's usually because western media tend to hypersexualise asian females to appear exotic. You'll probably notice that there are virtually no asian male role models in the media. All the asians that are in Anglo entertainment and news tend to be asian girls married or dating white guys. All experiences about growing up as an asian is written from a girls perspective. Any asian guys in Anglo movies tend to have emasculated guys that are nerdy(white guys are smart and that's ok but asian guys being smart is a bad thing) and gay but the underlying theme is that they never get the girl.

As an asian guy and a father it's very obvious from a young age and I need to protect my kids  from this so that they grow up without internalised hate. It's difficult when the home is also a battlefield.

The message is so pervasive in western society that nearly everyone is conditioned to believe that white is best. Imagine watching movies, tv, luxury ads, friends all talking and praising white masculine features since you were born...that's how pervasive it is.

Even if they don't appear self hating, being a parent and seeing a lot of these white male asian girl marriages (my workplace has a lot of these couples), the racism is subtle but it's there. I have a guy that has never wanted sons only daughters? Why? Is it because his sons will look asian? Or another couple where both of them only praise their children's white features. Another who has told me he likes asian women because they're more 'traditional' and she does reciprocate. My best friends wife behaves like a hypersexualised lucy liu with the makeup to go along with it to appear 'exotic'.

It's a bit long winded but it's because of this general praise of asian girls (black girls are never praised they're too aggressive...) and the continual whitewashing on them since birth that makes them internalise their racism and leads a lot of them to talk bad about asian guys (emasculate them) and to believe that marrying white is an improvement in social status and white is their saviour and proof of their integration into western society as the honorary white person.

In my family when I said about half were married including myself all the women have been international students where they've come from an environment where they aren't subjected to the white is right mentality. They do find asian me  attractive and don't think dating us is like dating their brother...

Sorry for writing so much but I feel that you do deserve a well written explanation to understand I'm not some jaded asian guy being a racist asshole.

If we're talking about the typical very loud, obnoxious, ""Thick"", aggressive black girl, it's a hell no from me, and the only thing reason it's because of your skin color is because of how YOU believe you should act because of it.

900,djptgmu,"&gt;The assignment of more adult-like 
characteristics to the expressions of young 
Black girls is a form of age compression. Along 
this truncated age continuum, Black girls are 
likened more to adults than to children and are 
treated as if they are willfully engaging in 
behaviors typically expected of Black women .... 
This compression ... [has] stripped Black girls of 
their childhood freedoms [and] ... renders 
Black girlhood interchangeable with Black 
womanhood.

&gt;Girlhood Interrupted: The Erasure of Black Girls’ Childhood
These perceptions are consistent with viewing Black 
girls as older than their age

&gt;In the words of one 
teacher captured in a recent study by Professor 
Edward W. Morris, “[T] 
hey think they are adults too, 
and they try to act like they should have control 
sometimes.”

&gt;Such comments demonstrate that 
stereotypes of Black girls, interpreted as “loud,” are 
imbued with adult-like aspirations, and perceived, 
in turn, as a threat. The same study recorded 
teachers’ describing Black girls as exhibiting “very 
‘mature’ behavior ... socially (but not academically) 
sophisticated and ‘controlling at a young age.’ ”

&gt;This interpretation of Black girls’ outspokenness 
may be associated with the stereotype of Black 
women as aggressive and dominating.

&gt;Differences in physical development based on the onset of 
puberty may also play a role in adultification, in light 
of evidence that “on average, African American girls 
mature physically at a faster rate than [w] 
hite girls 
and as a result can be perceived as older.”

Regardless of the odd participant selection, I'd say the quoted sections hold true."
901,dj868qy,"This is a very large and nuanced topic but I'll try to explain briefly.

SJW: An insult used against anyone left-wing (usually against feminists). It implies militancy because right-wing people believe ""SJWs"" are aggressive, petty, and want to silence anyone who disagrees with them. The term has also been reclaimed by the Left using it to jokingly refer to themselves. In many ways, the word ""SJW"" is the new popular way to say ""feminazi"" except the qualifications to be an ""SJW"" are far more nebulous.

Safe Space: A designated area where people of certain identities (rape survivors, LGBT people, racial minorities, etc) can meet each other and talk about their experiences without fear of being discriminated against. Conservatives  believe this concept is anti-free speech despite safe spaces being (for the most part) voluntary associations.

Microaggression: Microaggressions are a concept discussed and talked about in leftist/SJWs/feminists circles. Microaggressions are seemingly trivial, often subconscious, actions or remarks which communicate a prejudiced message about people of a marginalized group. A prototypical example is saying ""You're pretty for a black girl."" This communicates the idea that black girls are less pretty than girls of other races. Another example would be someone asking a lesbian if she's ever had sex with a man in the past, the lesbian replying no, then the other person saying something like ""Oh, so you've never had real sex?"" This implies that sex between a man and woman is the only kind of ""real"" sex. This also enforces the idea that heterosexuality is the correct sexuality and all deviations from it are abnormal. ""SJWs"" talk about microaggressions and the way they are ostracizing to marginalized person. Microaggressions create a culture where certain people feel unwelcome. Conservatives disagree and basically say ""suck it up, no one cares about how you feel."" Conservatives tend to believe that calling out or caring about the effects of microaggressions is petty, unnecessary, and whiny.

Cultural Appropriation: The act of a dominant culture stealing aspects of a oppressed or marginalized culture, typically to sell for profit. The problem of cultural appropriation mainly comes from the fact in many cases the cultural item is culturally demeaned or suppressed when used by the culture where it originated (or is being lifted from). For example, aspects of Native American culture (such as their language and religion) were illegal in the US for Native Americans to practice for a long time. However, the mainstream American culture adopted and commercialized the Native American headdress (a religious item in many Native American cultures) as a part of a stereotypical ""Native American costume"" These sort of costumes, which I'm sure you've seen in your life, reduce Native American culture to an offensive stereotype for other people to dress up in. I'd compare it to a scenario like this: Imagine Christianity is illegal. Imagine Christian practices such as going to church, attending Mass, or celebrating Easter were outlawed. Religious symbols such as the cross are outlawed and demeaned as well. Now imagine the people who outlawed those things selling Christian Crosses and priest outfits for the dominant group to wear on Halloween. It'd be pretty offensive, right? Regardless, conservatives typically see discussing the concept of cultural appropriation as whiny. They also believe the Left, by discouraging cultural appropriation, is acting in an authoritarian way. Conservatives have often used the argument that opposition to cultural appropriation makes the Left support complete cultural segregation. Many more nuanced right wing people bring up the concept of cultural exchange and the difficulty of who determining who ""owns"" which cultural practice, item, etc. However, the Left often counters this point by saying that exploitative power dynamics and racism are what makes cultural appropriation wrong, not the actual exchange of cultural items. There's also a discussion to be had about the idea of cultural appropriation vs cultural appreciation as well as the idea of assimilation.

Triggered: A term, when used correctly, often relates to being forced to mentally relive or re-experiences aspects of past trauma. For example, a rape survivor may be triggered by seeing rape depicted on TV, people making jokes about rape, or hearing other people's experiences with rape. This means that she/he may enter a dissociative state, become anxious, or severely psychologically unconformable. Someone who is ""triggered"" may have an anxiety attack or panic attack as a result. In recent years, trigger warnings (warnings that a particular piece of media or conversation contains elements that may trigger someone) have become a topic of debate. Conservatives believe trigger warnings are, again, whiny and demonstrate weakness and thus believe trigger warnings should not be allowed. As this ""debate"" has progressed, conservatives have begun to mockingly call anyone who is passionate or upset/frustrated ""triggered"". Example: Person A says something ""racist."" Person B replies ""That's racist. Stop."" Person A replies ""Why are you so triggered?!"" (This is a very simplified and less volatile representation of what those discussions actually look like.)

Snowflake: A word used by conservatives to imply that the person they're using it against thinks they're special or unique. I'll be brief: This term is used as an attempt to illegitmize transgender and non-binary identities.

Bernie-sucker: Never heard it.

Anyways, I hope I helped you understand. There's a lot more that I could have said but I wanted to be somewhat brief. I know my explanation of snowflake wasn't very good, however there are people in this comment section that have answered that question way better than I could've."
902,do7tgzp,"&gt;Calling out shitty behavior regardless of race is a-ok in my book. But occasionally you see dogwhistle terms (""these animals"" is one I see a lot) or implicit bias that people probably don't even realize they're showing.

I've seen the word ""animals"" to describe white people there as well. When you have a group of people, regardless of their color, jumping around and hooting and hollering while beating the shit out of each other, that's animalistic behavior. There's also people that get pissed when someone calls a black person a thug while they are beating the shit out of a special needs kid, even though ""thug"" isn't a racial word and perfectly describes what that person is being.

&gt;Example (on a video of a girl resisting arrest and ending up bloody): Emphasis mine. Like I have to wonder if that person would have questioned it had it been a black girl.

Why would you question that? Did you ever consider the commenter was black and people generally refer to the ""other"" by race? Why assume the worst? Like, what would you even question? Is there some sort of racial stereotype that says black girls are better at fighting cops or something?"
903,fxfrqjc,"&gt;It doesn't sound like I took anything out. You are just mindlessly parroting your talking points again. You are saying ""this is racist because it's racist"" I won't continue to address your circular reasoning.

Alright let me make it a little more explicit.  Generalizing is not inherently racist (or discriminatory).  I can say, for instance, that Marvel movies tend to be successful.  That's a generalization, and there are exceptions, but it is largely true and can be backed up with evidence.  There's nothing problematic here.

Generalizing about racial groups isn't even necessarily racist.  For example, I can say that black families tend to be less wealthy than white families ([source](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/)).  That is not racist because it is backed up by data, by evidence.

However, when you generalize about a racial group just based on your experiences and without sufficient evidence, *then* it becomes racist.  At this point, you are ascribing a certain behavior or characteristic to a racial group without evidence that that behavior or characteristic applies to most or all of the racial group.  That is what the son in this situation did.  He saw some black girls who were ""ghetto"" and generalized based on that.  That is racist because there is no reason to believe other black girls are ""ghetto.""

This line of reasoning is also problematic because of confirmation bias.  If he developed the idea that black girls are ""ghetto,"" then he likely only noticed ""ghetto"" black girls in the future, thus wrongly reinforcing his belief.  This is a well-known psychological phenomenon that makes it dangerous to generalize based on our experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;He doesn't owe them anything. He is not responsible for putting in the time to get to know every black person on earth so that he can decide exactly what percentage of them are ""too ghetto"" for his tastes. He can eyeball it and say ""too many"" of them are ""too ghetto"" so no thanks! This doesn't make him a racist.

Of course he doesn't owe them anything.  I'm not saying he has to date black girls.  However, his reasoning is racist because, again, he's generalizing about a racial group without sufficient evidence.  If we want to eliminate racism in the world, we all need to examine our own views and subconscious biases to ensure that we are not being racist or perpetuating racism.  It's okay if he doesn't want date black girls, but he shouldn't go around generalizing and saying they're ""too ghetto.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In truth, age is probably a far less determinate factor in how people tend to act than culture. There is nothing about the color of one's skin that makes them behave a certain way but you're either incredibly naive or just flat out being intellectually dishonest if you refuse to admit that certain behaviors and attitudes run very deep within different cultures.

Yeah, different cultures.  Not races, cultures.  Those are two very different things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If this young man doesn't hold the same values and beliefs or espouse the same attitudes then that will reflect in his willingness to associate with a certain group of people at large. Again, this is NOT racism.

Refusing to associate with a certain racial group because you think everyone in that racial group shares a certain characteristic is racist.  Not all black girls are the same.  However, by claiming that black girls are ""too ghetto,"" he is reinforcing a racial stereotype about black girls, which is racist.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;He never even said that being ""ghetto"" is inherently bad.

The word ""ghetto"" is derogatory.  No one ever uses the word ""ghetto"" as a compliment.  It was obviously meant as something bad.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Now, I could argue with you and say ""you have no right to say that about nuts. Not all nuts are salty. You can't generalize nuts based on the limited number of nuts you have tried, and the only way to make this right is to eat one of each and every type of nut on the entire planet until you've tried them all and judge them individually.""

Wait what?  Most (all?) nuts aren't inherently salty.  They become salted in the factory (i.e. as a result of their environments), so this entire analogy is just stupid bullshit that, if anything, supports my point.

And anyways, I never said you should ""try every nut"" or examine every black person.  But like, just treat people as people and don't judge based on race.  It's really not that hard.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I know you understand what I'm saying, you're just too scared to admit it because you feel the need to keep framing the racism narrative.

I'm not trying to push some ""racism narrative"" here.  I just want us all to acknowledge the racism in the world so that we can make the world a better place.  I'm not scared to admit anything lol.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Based on the story, the only thing we know for sure is that his sister tried to set him up with a friend and he declined citing the reason that black girls are ""too ghetto."" Now. If he knew the girl in question there is NO way he would resort to a stereotype. He would have said ""nah, Tatianna is too ghetto"" or, if he felt like being a little more sensitive, ""nah, Tatianna is not my type."" So the question remains, how did he know the girl his sister was trying to set him up with was black? I'd put $100 on his sister being dead set on getting him a black girlfriend so that she can improve his blackness quotient.

Maybe he just knew who she was (and thus knew her race) but didn't know anything about her.  Hell, I know who plenty of my sister's friends are (and thus I know their races), but I don't know anything about any of them.  It's perfectly normal to just meet someone in passing (and thus see their race) without really learning anything about them.

You're really grasping at straws to try to read some deeper agenda that just isn't there.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Struggling with reading comprehension again I see. Go back and re-read the original post, smooth-brain. The OP literally says that her daughter has been trying to introduce the kid to black friends, take him to BLM protests and tried to set him up on a date with a black girl. Christ, the girl's mom who spent the first 39 years of her life exclusively dating black men, was even upset that he doesn't listen to Reggae for fuck's sake. Black black black black black. It's clear that they venerate blackness above whiteness and view his lack of blackness as a deficiency that needs to be fixed. Stop fumbling around in the dark and open your damned eyes.

Nowhere does it say she specifically wanted to set him up with a black girlfriend.  One of her friends happened to be black, and she tried to set him up with her.  That's it.  Stop trying to read some anti-white narrative that just isn't there.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How the fuck would you know how he ""treats"" black women. He just doesn't want to date them. That's his choice, it does not affect them at all.

He referred to them as ""too ghetto.""  That's poor treatment of a racial group.  That kind of outlook needs to be changed in order to make the world a better place.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And sharing with somebody who isn't interested is no longer sharing, it's forcing something upon them. Or does consent not matter anymore? Would you like it if a stranger ""shared"" his genitals with you even though you didn't want him too?

Of course consent matters.  He has the option of saying no, and he clearly did.  That's not the core issue here.  The core issue, like I said in my original comment, is that he was racist towards black girls by racially stereotyping them as ""too ghetto."""

907,fqzod72,"It's okay for people who were hurt by HB to ""bury her."" It's 2020, she's 25. At these times I think of how 25-year-old white women are still growing, while 14-year-old black boys are considered dangerous men and the dialogue around young black girls can be even more pernicious. This is not a coincidence, this is systemic racism.

ETA: Ignorance is not an excuse. I grew up in a largely anti-black immigrant Asian household as an immigrant from a homogenous county. I could've been ignorant and passive, but we make choices and I made the choice to learn more. I call my family out on their shit every time, with no jokes and no comfort. I recognize my own privilege as an Asian but have been frequently misidentified as Black due to my physical characteristics and tbh at first I was bothered, but that led me to actually confronting what the root of that is . I also began reading Toni Morrison at the time, and her, among other authors and examining how the physicality of blackness is violated through many aspects of American culture and dialogue really made me understand both the root and wrong in my thoughts (AT 16 MIND YOU). This is without anyone canceling me, this is without me being told by other people I need to learn, this is without anyone even knowing I felt that way, and it was honestly wrong to feel. These things should feel wrong the moment we feel them, truly the moment we think them, and we should figure out why we feel that way, or at the least not act on it. I can't imagine Hannah who knew not to say fuck, but could say the n-word, has ever come close to examining that, but she should have."
908,fht68ep,"&gt;	Saying that white people can experience racism ignores the history of white supremacy and colonialism

Seems to me like you’re equating “racism” to the experiences of oppressed people. Of course race was more often than not used in attempts to justify said oppression, but you’re saying that because of the different historical context, racism directed at a white person is *fundamentally different* than other racism. Hell, you’re saying they can’t so much as *experience* racism in the current state of the world. That’s a silly take.

“Because i’ve never met one, and media hasn’t taught me otherwise, I believe white boys are all sweaty, angry, low-aspring scumbags who live by cheetos and playing guitar hero.”


“Because i’ve never met one, and media hasn’t taught me otherwise, I believe black boys are all sweaty, angry, low-aspring scumbags who live by cheetos and playing guitar hero.” 

A silly example definitely, but nevertheless both are examples of racism, they are generalizations made about a group of people, and are based solely on their race, leaving room for perhaps a minutia of consideration into the differing state of the communities. What about the two statements is different? Are you arguing that one is more harmful or dangerous to society, considering the historical and current social contexts in which PoC exist? 

A better way of putting it would be to say white people don’t experience the same societal effects *of* racism (oppression!). But you can’t say they are unable to experience racism unless you were to fundamentally change the definition of the word “racism.”"
909,ffg87jj,"Colorism is a thing, beauty standards are a thing. These have mostly come out of racism and massively influence us. 

Our preferences all come from somewhere and we’re influenced by society. If society has been upholding racist stereotypes for the longest time like black girls are ratchet and loud and Asian men are feminine, those views become a norm which is very dangerous. It’s not direct racism but it’s all linked."
910,fecjhdj,"It is supposed to only be used in an emergency, and an emergency is a situation where someone is in danger of being seriously injured or killed. 

What happens is in certain situations children escalate and become difficult to ""control"" and it is used for that instead of a *Positive Behavior Support Plan.* Every child who has an IEP (Individualized Education Plan when they are qualified under a disability to receive Special Education Services) should have a Positive Behavior Support Plan.

For example 9 year old Jon has Dxs of ADHD, ASD and an Anxiety Disorder. He has 1:1 support, which means he is supposed to have 1 adult paying attention to him and his cues at all times. 

Here is a typical way that restraint comes about: 

 Jon was about to play a card game and is listening to the rules. But the other kids in the group are talking and not listening. So the teacher tells them they are not listening so they won't play the game. (Strike 1: adult is not paying attention to Jon's good behavior. Just acknowledging it and that Jon has a right to be disappointed goes a long way in making Jon feel heard, which all by itself, can de-escalate troubling behavior.)

Jon protests loudly, teacher reiterates that they can't play. Jon protests more and calls the teacher a bad name. Teacher asks Jon to ""take a break outside."" Jon doesn't want to miss anything in class so doesn't want to go outside, and is still feeling angry at not getting to play the game when he was quiet and listening to the rules. So he says he's not going.

Adults around Jon are feeling stressed as Jon escalates. Jon is escalating because the 1:1 support is not happening. Instead, an adult takes Jon by the arm and begins to move him outside. (Strike 2, putting hands on an autistic child who isn't touching anyone or being dangerous, just in the staff's eyes, annoying and ""misbehaving."")

Jon, having sensory challenges, does not like being touched and is now in fight or flight mode. Now 2 staff are holding him and leading him outside, half carrying him. Because he cannot get away, he is now in full fight mode as they wrestle him to the ground, screaming.

Jon is held in a prone restraint until he ""has a calm body and a calm voice."" 

Would you be able to have a calm body and voice with all of these feelings running through your body while 2 adults have their knees on the back of your legs and holding your arms down and away from your sides with your face down?

Is this a true emergency? Could it have been prevented? Is it helpful?

Jon ends up being held in this *emergency* position for 93 minutes. 

Restraint is harmful because
1. He has missed instruction
2. His peers have watched the scene unfold and Jon is humiliated
3. Jon is bruised and sore from being held down so long
4. The staff has been traumatized because nobody actually likes to hold children down.
5. The staff now sees Jon as trouble, and are more likely to interpret his behavior the same way the next time he is upset leading to the same result and causing a cycle.
6. Jon now has ptsd.

All of this to say that this kind of scenario is very common, where staff fail to catch the issues early on and escalate the behavior themselves through poor training, not following the IEP or BSP, ignorance or inattention.

Very rarely is there a true emergency situation.

Edited to add that children with disabilities and black boys are the most likely to be restrained."
911,f83yonb,"A couple things about this. 

Firstly, and I'm definitely going to get flame for this one, I think that she is working under the misguided notion that math is apolitical. The way math is used and taught, who can learn it and who should learn it, the canonization of the Western narrative of progression (mainly due to special, great, white men), and just any social interaction between people with varying levels power all have political ramifications. It may be convenient that everyone uses standard mathematical notation around the world but it's a result of imperialism, and math education towards this norm was used as a tool for control, domination, and erasure of native cultures. Furthermore, it is harder to access math if you're Hispanic or black, a woman or LGBT. This is largely because mathematicians are constructed as straight, white, cis men and this is pervasive in our culture. Black boys are treated different in math class than white boys. Young girls interested in math not only have to do the mental labor of learning and doing math at a competitive level, but must also engage in the added labor of being a girl in a masculine space. Math can get away with this because of the myth that it is apolitical and just about getting proofs right or wrong. There is so much more that goes into learning math, doing math, and communicating math that has nothing to do with the content of math and these aspects of doing math prevent people from succeeding in it. So her argument that it is bad because it is political is not really satisfactory since math itself is political and painting math as apolitical is a political act. Also, the comparisons to McCarthyism reek of ""both-sides"" enlightened centrism, which pairs well with this perceived apolitical-ness of math. There is a huge difference between signing an official document that you're not of a political party, and having a rubric to assess how well they understand and engage with diversity issues. I just find it stunning the people still think that we can justly navigate the world while being colorblind and genderblind and ""don't ask, don't tell""ing. That's just a great way to perpetuate the unjust status quo, and no wonder the MLK thought the apathetic white middle class was more dangerous than the explicit racist groups of the day.

Second, I do agree that these kinds of diversity statements are BS. These are attempts to solve complicated systemic issues through bureaucracy. Moreover, they probably function more to protect the institution than to encourage faculty to engage in social issues. If they get people with high diversity scores then the institution can't be held accountable when something bad inevitably does happen. They have the bureaucracy to clear their name. Based on the rubric, as long as you go to a diversity training and say ""huh, micro-aggressions *do* exist and seem like they must suck!"", put a rainbow sticker on your office door, and help the ""Girls in Math"" undergrad club run a meeting or two a year, you'll probably be able to pass. It doesn't really check for any substantive knowledge or engagement with social justice, it's ineffective and exists to protect their ass and image. Bureaucracy is not the answer to systemic social issues."
912,ezcqyp5,"Very well put together. This perfectly illustrates how patriarchy is bad for both women and men. I’m pretty sure innocent men don’t enjoy being perceived as dangerous by default. As a black women i can’t help but think in particular of the way white women tend to perceive black men even more as threat. For real, for a very long time, it felt like black men were the default suspects when a white women claimed she had been attacked by somebody. And to this day, black men are way more scared of being perceived as an aggressor when they find themselves alone with white women in the streets, because they know that if they slightly step out of line, very few people will have empathy for them and it will end up badly if the police is involved. Black boys are already killed for playing rap music or ~being tall~ oh excuse me! « Looking menacing ». Many of them grow up thinking they will be perceived as the bad guy by default.

914,emcxhgp,"Yes there is a problem. I’ve seen it in my own life and heard of it from accounts of my friends who are also desi but grew up in the west.

“Don’t associate with blacks, they’re all dangerous/crazy/etc”

“Don’t go for white women, they’re all morally loose”

“White men are not trustworthy”

“Black girls are crazy”

“Hispanic people are stupid”

“Blacks are all animals”

I’ve noticed it less directed towards Oriental people, probably cuz there are some similarities culturally, but I’m sure if a desi were to try to marry one then more often than not race would come up as an issue.

Even in this subreddit I’ve noticed it. Not just towards other races but bigotry and hate towards desis of different origins.

It’s unfortunate and I honestly thought that with my generation racism would decline but after what I’ve seen on some parts of Reddit, the recent shootings and attacks (though some of those can be credited to incels), and what I’ve noticed in the workplace… There is a decline but it will be more noticeable in the next generation.

(I should really wear my glasses in public.) If I don’t recognise anyone, I don’t shit myself - why would I? The amount of times black boys in and out of school have offered me help carrying stuff or to get my buggy up and down stairs when my child was little...so many example of young men who had a mum and/or dad that raised them right. 

Of course some black boys are not good people, same as white boys.

I don’t know if it is just because that’s how it was first presented, or if it is suggesting that black boys are less intelligent by being dumb enough to use a glory hole.  It is racist by today’s standards because *everything* is racist today. It certainly doesn’t post the child in a positive light, and those exaggerated features show that it was trying to be demeaning. I just know I wouldn’t have it hanging in my bathroom, much less my furniture store. "
927,fxdwqfu,"I am so sorry that you went through that and without going to deeply into my own experiences, I feel you and understand you.  Handling trauma is different for everyone, so I definitely understood to an extent him using his trauma as dark humor jokes because I do that as well with my own mental health and other issues. I don’t want to take that away from Shane, because I understand how much it can help cope.

But there is a line and I think Shane has crossed it.  I could go on and on about the willow smith situation and how sexualized young black girls are and how they are constantly seen as older by everyone around them which opens up young black girls to being victims of CSA and predatory people. But also like, some of the jokes are disturbing to hear as a victim. The idea of him calling the cheerleader sexy? Saying he looked up n*ked babies and said they were sexy? All of his other tweets and old forums? Piece by piece I think people would be okay with calling it a joke, but all of that together  is what pushed it over the edge.

I hope he changes and will eventually give a genuine apology, but as you pointed out him constantly hanging out with other people who have been known to say racist things... the outlook is looking not so good for me. Thank you so much for this thoughtful response"
928,eeq05km,"I agree with you. Black girls are seemingly always expected to be stronger, louder, more self sufficient, more sexual.

&amp;#x200B;

When in fact, due to the intersection of gender and race, they are more vulnerable. More in need of protection. Because of the need to support the black community against racism sometimes pressure to not disclose, to not make waves, is more intense. They aren't believed in the same way. Their tears and pain seemingly do not have the same impact.

&amp;#x200B;

R Kelly has been a predator for decades, and he's been talking about it in his songs, and no one did a thing until now, except black women. And once its done, they won't be remembered for it despite doing the bulk of the work. Like Tarana Burke.

929,efzboka,"The reason is that many crimes perpetrated against  vulnerable populations go unsolved. Black girls are underrepresented, and crimes against black people in general tend to have a power solve rate. I don’t think there is any question that the news focuses on disappearances involving white girls and women. This mans point is that if a predator knows which victims will have the most vigorous investigations, they will prey on the others.

This isn’t to say all cops are out there just helping white victims, what we are talking about are societal trends. This bears out most clearly in homicide statistics in high black neighborhoods. Why they go unsolved goes beyond just matters of race and is a rather complex answer."
930,e1l60ou,"Because (according to CNN) a shockingly overwhelming majority of African American women molest their children. This is why so many young black men knock up the neighborhood hoodrat, then dip on them as soon as they’re old enough to know better. 

Apparently they think that any chick that can’t possibly remind them of the trauma they went through as an adolescent at the hands of their own mother is better than the alternative. 

It also partially explains why there are so many homo black dudes. 

The lesson here seems to be that in addition to being horrendously displeasing to the eye, black girls are disgusting predators that most sane people wouldn’t willingly fuck even with a stolen dick and someone else pushing. "
931,dvvx422,"Fuck off with that shit. I’m Arab myself.

This attitude is common everywhere outside of white Northwest Europeans.

I met an Angolan who said white girls are for fucking black girls are for marrying. Ive met Afghans and Pakistanis who do what these kids did. There is absolutely a type of Muslim guy who goes out to fuck drunk white women while sober because they are seen as whores. 

Ive seen this firsthand, but the guys i met werent rapists but they fucked drunk girls met at clubs while sober. But there is absolutely something predatory about it.

Its true that they wouldnt do this to women from their own community."

Like tbh they’re really overestimating their desirability when they lay down their standards too, but a lot of it is based in racism. If I had a dollar for every time I’ve heard “Black girls are just too loud for me, and they always looks so fake and made up” I’d actually be fucking rich"
938,fw0es5x,"Yeah but not just that, it is more evident on a social level. Like Latinos will always be nice to their own but they will also be super nice to whites and even black people.

It’s sad, and thank you for the comments. I will never ever get with a guy that even has the assumption that black girls are loud/ghetto, and act as if I am the exception to those stereotypes.

941,frvl73d,"Maybe, but I doubt it. 

I'm black, so I have heard a lot of men (online and IRL) explain to me why they don't date black women. It's never just about physical attraction. No matter what excuse they start out with, it always ends up being based on stereotypes -- black girls are loud, angry, classless, ghetto, greedy, have no jobs, fake hair, 10 kids from 10 baby daddies, etc etc. Even if they try to say it nicely, like ""I'm just not into that body shape,"" or ""I don't think she would fit in at my favorite places,"" it's a weak argument. Every single black woman in the world has the exact same shape? There are no black women anywhere who would fit in at a country club? Bullshit.

In my experience, physical attraction is almost always an excuse."
942,fmtxrr3,"There is a strong difference between preference vs racism. If he thinks all black girls are loud, have fake hair and nails or can't be attractive then he has some racist views.

Its not just superficial, it's also racist.
(A lot of them are really, really, really racist- on god bro they'll say the n word quicker than you put your pants back on! One actually had the audacity to say that raping me was ok because I'm black.)

A shit ton of them mix in stereotypes with the attraction, which is why the minority that don't get the shit they do.

I'm not taking ANY chances.

948,fcg0r0a,I’ve never heard a loud Asian girl they’re all quiet. If anything black girls are loud
949,fdplhid,"I don’t mean to say this as a thing against Asian males because really it’s an issue regarding both. Black women do like Asian men, it’s just Asian men are too scared or even racist to go for one. I’ve talked a few of my buddies about it. The norm they all seem to say is that they couldn’t see themselves with one, for many reasons. One of them said black girls are too loud, one straight out said he didn’t want a “ghetto ratchet” girl. Most Asian males that I know of aren’t with AMBW. Won’t lie though black girls are ignorant. Apparently my wang size was an on going discussion between her friends. One day one of her friends straight up asked us about it. We didn’t give her the answer she wanted. Dick size seemed to really matter to her friends. It matter to her too. I asked her why her friends kept going on about it. She simply said “It verys from girl to girl but most of us like the average or higher” I asked her why and she replied “Because nobody wanna fuck a 2 incher for the rest of they life”. I came to the conclusion that size really does matter, to most black girls at least. And maybe for that reason, black females aren’t  actively going for asian males. Due to the rumors of course. 

Quite honestly I’ve always liked black girls more then asian girls. Yes they maybe loud but they aren’t afraid to speak their minds. Communication is key to any relationship. And as for a the ghetto part, Asians are just as ghetto or more then Black people. We’ve been together for 2 years and we’ve stayed happy with each other. Happiness is what matters in the end."
950,f8p4rm5,"It’s okay to have a preference. 
The issue is when people demean black girls instead of saying they just don’t like them. 
Often I hear black girls are too “ Loud” and “ Ghetto” when talking about attraction. Not all black girls are like this, and shouldn’t be demeaned for it."
951,f3orqhz,"So it's racist, but is it wrong? In my experience black Americans are *significantly* louder and more, uh, ""lively"" than their white counterparts. Generally speaking, people that have evolved to live in colder climates, not just white Europeans, but also Asians, Eskimos etc. are much more reserved and less loud than that have evolved in hot climates and in Southern hemispheres for the past thousands of years. And that generally is true for the African migrants here in Europe, too. And it's also true within races - or do you think the average Scandinavian is as extroverted as the average Italian or Spaniard? Certainly not.

And the thing about black girls getting mad when the black boys go for white girls... I mean, websites where black women tend to congregate are full of that kind of thing (see lipstickalley for example), there's subreddits here where you see it frequently, there's thousands of these cases on Twitter. It's undeniable that white women are generally seen as the most desirable by all races. And black women as the least desirable. There is a lot of data on that, from Okcupid to other dating websites, to empirical studies and various polls. It's pretty much a given that some black girls are not going to be very excited at having been dealt the short straw on the dating market."

The stereotype that black girls are loud and obnoxious really irritates me because I’m not like that. I’m calm composed and don’t have attitude 24/7 but then I interact with other black girls in my class and it just makes me disappointed. Don’t get me wrong they’re semi good people, but the fact that you’re 18 and giving the teacher who’s trying to give you help and tell you to stfu and listen and you still give him attitude like he’s at fault just irks me.

990,egt7h3j,"It's multifactorial:

1. Our society pushes ""european features"" as the standard for beauty so many young white AND black boys are socialized into loving straight blonde hair, light skin and european facial features. Black beauty becomes ""exotic"" and ""the other""
2. There's a stereotype of black women being loud, angry and obnoxious so white guys shy away from flirting or approaching them 
3. There's a lot of gatekeeping by black men in black society (""we don't allow OUR women to date THOSE people"") similar to what white society once did. So white men are intimated by that. 
4. Teenage pregnancy rates are huge in black communities so a ton of black women in their 20s are already moms. This decreases the interest from a lot of young white guys 

&amp;#x200B;

A caveat to all this of course, is that when I say ""black"" I specifically mean ""African American"" because this is not a universal phenomenon. White men + Black women couples are incredibly common in Brazil (where I'm from) and black and brown women are highly desired and coveted by white men.  "

It doesn’t imply that anyone should prefer tomatoes on their burger. 

Secondly, this does suggest a dislike of black people. There is a specific mention of race, “the black girls “ associated with a behavior, “being too loud” that doctor octopus and his friends do not like. The joke here is specifically targeted at the stereotype that black girls are loud and that is unlikable. Take the “black girls “ part out and it immediately makes the joke less funny. This joke is relying on that stereotype, a stereotype that is often used to demean people of color. By making a joke, it’s reinforcing this idea that black people posses this quality of loudness that is unliked, thus making black people unlikable. "

It doesn't matter if it's actually true or not to these white men because they believe what the media tells them about the opinions of black women because they aren't communicating directly with black women that often. It's not really about not liking black girls, honestly, for white men. If white men were convinced that black girls were ""safe"" to engage with (meaning they wouldn't be interacting with someone who hates them and is angry at them), they would engage with black girls. If black girls want to be loud and angry at other people, a lot of guys of any race can look past that-- they may even find it quirky and endearing.

Maybe 10+ years ago, but the media has more black people in modeling, entertainment, and advertisements than their demographics would suggest. 

&gt;There's also the loud, uncouth, controlling black woman stereotype. The stereotype is that white women are less trouble and meeker compared to black women and so less trouble. Haven't you ever wondered why some crazy people say Michelle Obama is a man?

I mean if you've lived in a city you'd see some merit to loud black chicks, not that there's anything wrong with that, it's a stereotype for a reason. But obviously it's still a stereotype, some black girls are incredibly sweet and reserved.

As for claiming Michelle is a guy, that's really rude but Id say black women can have some masculine features and generally are more muscular than white, and asians being the smallest and most femanine, from my perspective.

People are pushed as trend by all types of media (from mass media to social media). e.g.  black women and asian men are not hot right now. and white men are in the decline (cis white male). 

Examples would be a number of acquaintances say black girls are too masculine (ghetto, loud, standoff-ish, don't need no man), they want an asian, latina, or white girl. it's in a lot of rap songs as well, along with a rise in non-black girls as music video dancers.

Not all black girls have wide noses

Not all black girls have kinky hair

Not all black girls have big lips

Not all black girls are loud

The only unifying thing the group has is that...they're black. If containing blackness is a deal breaker (with no basis in looks, but because they are black), then that is the problem. 

To recap, saying, ""I dont like big lips on my girls"" makes a set of girls from all races. But this means one will date a black girl who does not have big lips, ceteris paribus.

Kids may have been prevalent in the theaters but it isn't just small children watching these movies nor is it just them enjoying it. That's clear by how angry you come off when someone has a different opinion, black little girls can enjoy this but this is the laziest and most racist form of representation. Ariel the now black little merimaid, ""see we are all for diversity now!"" This is just throwing those black little girls and boys, those black families a bone. 
If they wanted more representation and genuinely cared about diversity than why not make an original black princess, not randomly make a white character black for money and diversity points. 
How am I racist for pointing that out?

This isn't about slavery or related to it but black Europeans.. You mean the ones who live in Europe but typically have hertiage that is from a different environment. Right? I am talking about the natives of a specific culture, if Ariel was Celtic then I am talking about natives of those culture not individuals who were brought there either through slavery or migration for economic interest. The Disney version is based off European culture with the use of Greek culture and with the appearance of the the original creator of the little mermaid. Also I've looked into the location, it is either in the Mediterranean or Caspian which like I said does have European inhabitants. 

How am I being racist? I disagree with the casting, just like I disagreed with Emma Watson as Belle or the desire of Ariana Grande as Ariel. I am not saying there should be no black princesses or characters in European settings but to replace character that we already know is white as black is ridiclous. There is something wrong, you made a point on how they're clearly doing this for diversity sake. Black Ariel is a slap on, this isn't a story where black culture is on focus or it is a  character that is tokenized, those black little girls you care about so much will still see Ariel being promoted as white. 
A normal person would be able to carry on a normal conversation, this isn't normal. 
I expected to at least follow the original, I wasn't asking for disney to add in anything new but keep it original. Young black girls are happy with Tiana the original black princess not Ariel token black princess. 

I didn't have a reddit account when frozen came out but most disney movies don't stick to the original, that is something most people accept when it comes to disney. Plus it being in Norway doesn't incite lazy representation of a demographic. The little mermaid live action does."

1057,eh5o9h3,"&gt; You're conflating different axes of privilege. Obama's daughters may suffer less racism due to their wealth, but (AA proponents believe that) most black girls probably do compete at a disadvantage with your daughters in academics and jobs.

Odd that there's no evidence for this. According to The Root, [black women are the most educated group in America](https://www.theroot.com/black-women-now-the-most-educated-group-in-us-1790855540), and they'd likely have a higher average income too if it weren't for the astronomical single-motherhood rate in the black community (which is not caused by racism).

&gt;Off the top of my head: (1) people, including admissions, HR, and bosses, are generally biased towards others like themselves; (2) kids relate best to role models of similar demographics to themselves; and (3) black girls are stereotyped as lazy or unprofessional.

(1) is dubious, especially when you have a goal of diverse hiring, (2) isn't caused by racism, and (3) affirmative action does nothing to help this.

&gt;Are you implying that poor whites and Asians cannot get need-based scholarships?

Scholarships, including racial scholarships, are not affirmative action, so this isn't relevant.

&gt;Hyperbole/demonization doesn't help you here.

I disagree.

&gt;Is it more likely that AA proponents want to ""punish success"", or that they aren't looking hard enough for the factors causing success?

The former, clearly. All the rhetoric is oriented around punishing those who are successful. This is why demographic representation is the primary justification for AA.

&gt;And even if you meant that AA has the effect of punishing success, well any effort whatsoever to help the unsuccessful - public or private - will to some extent have the effect of punishing success.

Completely untrue. Charity and voluntary organizations do not punish success.

&gt;If you soften your claim to be that too much focus is put onto race, compared to economics, then I'm right there with you.

This difference in focus is the reason I believe it's a form of systematic racism. If it were *only* based on individual circumstances, similar to how needs-based scholarships work, I'd probably have little problem with it. But because race is factored *over* individual circumstances, the only rational conclusion is that the policy itself is racist.

Now, I'm sure people *tell themselves* it's not racist. Most racists don't really think of their beliefs as racist, they think of them as simply ""how things are."" *Those people* need assistance because *those other people* have an advantage, and therefore we need a policy that treats people differently according to their racial group, *even when individual circumstances are known.*

True racism involves treating people differently according to their race even when you have enough information to be able to operate outside of stereotypes. And when you establish it as a matter of institutional policy, it's now systemic. Therefore, affirmative action, *because* it does not take into account individual circumstances even when those circumstances are know, is systematically racist.

If individual circumstances disqualified someone from AA, I probably wouldn't mind it, but at that point there'd really be no reason to include race as a criteria, because frankly race doesn't tell you very much about a person."

Are you too intellectually lazy to even seek out the original story? It's 2 clicks buddy. From said story:

&gt;The students will still participate in the main commencement ceremony, too.

and

&gt;The event, which took nearly a year to plan and is scheduled for the morning of May 23, is an effort to acknowledge the struggles and resilience that black students have had to possess in order to thrive in higher education, an environment where minorities are typically underrepresented.

Does that sound racist and Jim Crow like to you? Tell me, when there were segregated proms where the white students held their own whites-only prom separate from the official school prom, did they also plan going to the official prom? Were their motives for holding a seperate prom similar to the above? 

From your next link:

&gt;Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, said it was necessary to prepare for such an option because so many black boys are failing to get good GCSEs.


So, you're saying that they separate black students from white students in the Jim Crow era because they were concerned about their grades and academic performance? Is that why they also gave them substandard and underfunded schools and barred them from colleges and universities?

Probably because we weren't in the same laughably ignorant activist laden sociocultural environment we are in now. I have little doubt that if these series/movies came out now there would be great condemnation of them, from a non-insignificant amount of tumblrites/activists.

I guess it’s the norm to prefer being demure, timid, restrained in women. In that vein it’s also traditionally expected that the man will shoot his shot, be more emotionally composed, earn more, and be older than his woman. 

What really gets me going are type A bossy bitches. High achieving, go getting women who make a lot of money and aren’t afraid to step on toes to get what they need done. The women who will be transparent even if it means hurting your feelings. The equitable ones who will put more work in to the relationship than you thought was possible. 

It’s also sad that this is the case, but black women aren’t really seen as conventionally attractive within our Eurocentric beauty framework (this is slowly changing). Which is a god damn shame, because black girls are magical. And in my experience, they’re not afraid to express their interest. "
1066,elm2xd9,"When I was around 11/ 12 I went to the doctor for a physical for cheerleading and the female non-black doctor repeatedly asked if I was sexually active and when I said no she said “you have to tell me if you are” and I was so confused I said “but I’ve never even had a boyfriend” (and frankly felt kinda scared and uncomfortable because my mom hadn’t even talked to me about sex at that point but for some reason everyone assumed the black girls were just doing it like rabbits) then she switched her line of questioning and began to ask if I was aware of any firearms in the house, I said no and again she insisted I answer truthfully despite my already having done so. All for a fucking physical. I couldn’t understand it in the moment but I look back and feel righteous fury. The idea that black girls are hyper sexual is so damaging and dehumanizing, and adults are always the ones perpetuating this myth."
1067,enfetvo,"Not sure if that's true. But if it is, then maybe because the giggling uwu Asians are seen as non-threatening and harmless, while the black girls are seen as hyper-sexual and hyper-curvy. So maybe this is why the awkward type feels attracted to those allegedly non-threatening, while the masculine and athletic type feels attracted to those allegedly hyper-sexual. The latter wants to tame a black beast, the former cuddle with his kawaii princess and play vidya with her."
1068,dnraeng,"Black girl here. First of all you must be very attractive. There's no doubt about that.  You might find that black girls are ""worse"" specifically because of your majority white environment. They see you as almost like a unicorn. Trust me. I went to a majority white/Asian high school and there were only a certain amount of black guys there. And when they dated white girls it was seen as a bit of a disappointment and a loss. Nothing much you can do about that. 

I suggest just treating people as normally as possible. Almost pretend like you don't notice. If they start doing weird shit say ""Are you okay?"" or pretend like you really don't see their advances. If someone asks if you're gay, which is inevitable, just admit you're asexual. If they have a problem they can miss you. Bye.  If you get compliments accept them and keep trucking. 

Focus on your studies and social life, but don't pretend. Black men are always perceived as hyper masculine or hyper sexual. No need to buy into the hype if it's not you. Just be comfortable with yourself. "
