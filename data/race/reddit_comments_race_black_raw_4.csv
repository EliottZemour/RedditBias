0,fy1nsxh,"Why am I comparing the species of incredibly greedy aliens with big ears to the race of people with the same negative stereotype? Why am I saying that the race of dark skinned warriors might be going off the notion that dark skinned people are violent?

I dont share these beliefs but the racist asshats that live all around me do. I understand that it's a tv show. I understand that they are alien races.
I'm simply saying that there is a lot more racism in between the lines than we'd all like to admit"
1,fqofutp,"You make a very good point. People are so quick to point out that the dark skinned people are the east are the bad guys and the white people in the west are the good guys, but that's probably the way it is because of what lands Sauron took over. Also people claim that orcs are like Africans, but are they really?  They're just depicted as a primitive and violent race and if Africans are the first thing that come to mind when you think ""primitive and violent"" you probably need to look at yourself."
2,fspiow1,"I think every race is racist one way or another. American blacks are as racist as whites. Asians say europeans have big noses, europeans... Well. They can't say anything anymore. Even us latinos, assume that dark skinned people are good at sports, good lovers or whatever.

This is fact, and no amount of politcal correctnes can wash it away.

So there's that. Now. The second part, and this is the part where latinamerica is decades ahead of the US: Hating someone doesn't give you the right to step on his neck and choke him.

For example, us dark skinned latinos get called the N word. The people using the word are fully aware of everything it means, but they use it in a kind of sarcastic way. Just like you'd call your friend fat for eating two burgers, or you'd say ""You lazy motherfucker"" to a close friend but not a stranger. Is this racist? Absolutely. Do they feel better than me? Probably not. Would they give their life to save me? Many of them.

We do have racism, we do have problems. But on much much smaller scope, and that's partly because we tolerate non-violent racism, but crack down hard on anyone who actually acts on it. If you go to our jails, skin colors are the same you see downtown; nobody goes to jail because of their color of their skin, but they could have trouble finding a job or a good home.

The only case of a black person being killed by cops here, is a black woman who had no ID and didn't speak spanish, which was probably the real reason she got hit with a stick. But still. We treated it as a racist cop, public officials apologized and some heads rolled.

In the US they doubled down and guarded the house of the murderer. One of the reasons you're 3 times less likely to be murderer here is because we don't have guns, and we don't hate each other enough to actually want to see our ""enemies"" die. But we do insult them mercilessly, so it's not heaven either!"
3,fstc9co,I play video games and i love nature you are just using a stereo type s’immoler to the one that all dark skinned people are violent
4,fhnpjjk,"I'll tell you this as a biologist, animals do not have melanin for the same reasons humans do, and, most predatory animal have very LITTLE melanin in their skin. The premise of their argument doesn't work, it merely disguises a cultural bias that dark-skinned people are more violent. What we accept as a psychological premise, as well as in sociology, is that violence is predetermined by other socioeconomic problems. Its important to understand the science behind the information you spread. If you don't, you might end up spreading misinformation."
5,fjckne3,"We do and this is a good place to highlight that yes, whileq racism here is not violent like it is in the West, there are multiple daily microaggressions that local minorities face. From discrimination in the rental market and certain jobs, MRT ""random"" bag checks, comments on how ugly/scary/smelly dark skinned people are...  just because it is less visble and overt doesn't make it any less isolating and hurtful."
6,fajkxfw,"I understand what you're saying is coming from empathy and care. Your intentions might be good but they aren't scientifically correct to say the least. 


&gt; this not the use and throw approach that I am talking about? do you think this is morally right? many Americans are turning vegans because they have realized this truth

If it's the use and throw approach why even domesticate them. Keeping them locked with their freedom curbed, forced to mate. Using them for dairy is akin to locking them up in a prison. So again that's subjective. 

Now look at what's actually happening. Since the cow slaughter ban, dairy owners are just abandoning the cows once it stops giving milk. Earlier they were moved to slaughterhouses and their meat used. To them they are a business asset. That's resulting in them dying on the roads or in shelters that dont find it  profitable to keep them. Also did you know India is right up there with the biggest exporters of beef ?

https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/more-than-70000-cows-died-in-a-gaushala-during-bjp-rule/article26072773.ece

Also people are turning vegan due to the fad. Cows contributing to global warming, the cruel conditions in which they are kept and killed in factories for meat. They are doing that with all animals not just cows by the way. It's in the name. 

&gt;civilizations with utilitarian approach to life risk descending into Nazism.

Honestly in the most polite sense this is just bullshit. People were and will be bigots. They are afraid of outliers. Mainly because we are good at differentiating and finding safety in same numbers. Dark skinned people are looked at differently in white dominated areas and vice versa. They justify their fear in various forms. Nazism if i may call it relied just on this.  Made the Germans think they are genetically superior than others. Which isn't scientifically true. Evolution doesn't necessarily mean 'progress'. It's just random change and adaptation to it. Like human intelligence might not be a step ahead in evolution, it could lead to our demise. 

&gt;I am not saying empathy can be cultivated ONLY by not eating beef - this was one of the tools used in India -

Elephants crows etc. have also shown signs of empathy. So it's more genetic than a developed trait. Same as how some people have anger issues. So there is not merit in saying indians are more empathetic than the rest of the world. It's just wishful thinking. 

&gt;But it is because empathy is lacking in the Western civilization that we have had: 1. Nazism - where millions were suffocated in gas chambers (genocide) 

There is no scientific connection between the two. It was more propoganda/agenda driven that lead to people killing each other. 

Akin to cow lynching. How is a person who is empathetic to a cow killing a human ? More empathy for an animal than a fellow human? How does one function opposite to your core genetic makeup ? Propaganda - sorry to burtst your bubble but you're also part of the problem here my friend. 

&gt;Colonialism, and plunder of riches of other nations (which is how Europe got the money to progress) 3. Genocide of red indians and usurpation of their land by Americas (that is how they too became rich from natural resources) 4. It is the lack of American and European public's empathy which has caused them to support the wars in iraq, afganistan, syria, libya, vietnam etc....where millions lost their lives - all for oil and other resources 5. A lack of empathy and blind pursuit of control and theft of others has led the West into World Wars I and II and maybe even III.

It's easy to point fingers and not look at our history. Human by nature are violent. Some more than others, i give you that. But before the British came 'India' too was fighting wars within. I can assure you they were brutal to say the least. 

Also as you say if indians are more empathetic because of cows how did 2002 riots happen ? How are children in Kashmir being killed ? What about the at atrocities in the North East? Empathy doesn't just stop there. We have one of the highest mortality rates in the world. Most of our polulation is hungry. Where is your empathy then ? 

These are extremely complicated issues and again I'm fairly certain cows aren't involved. 

You're confusing human morality with life. One is a human construct and the other is just random."

We could go on and on. At the end of the day, anyone can read anything into whatever they want. Some read the Bible and are convinced it teaches that dark skinned people are inferior. Some read the Bible and are convinced it teaches it is ok to kill nonbelievers. Neither of these are taught. Some have read the Bible and have greatly improved their lives and are much happier. Why the difference in comprehension? It depends on what a person really wants in their heart.

15,ehv24pi,"Explanation: Pit bull is literally a short haired and body faced dog. It’s not technically a breed. Although the pit bull terrier is a pit bull (because it looks like one), that is still a visual description. More in depth, pit bulls are legit just some sort of bulldog or bulldog mix, or not even a bull dog, just a boxy face. If all pit bulls are aggressive, then all dark skinned people are aggressive, but if a black perdón is albino, they are not aggressive because they don’t “look black”, and a white person with a tan is automatically violent because they “look black”. See how racist you sound when using your logic?"
16,e5zowil,"In general, pretty okay. There are of course exceptions here and there. But most of the time, out of what I’ve seen, the fact that a character is black, Indian or Hispanic or whatever is incidental. Which is the way these things should be, unless you’re writing a historical piece. In that case, yes racism and cultural context matter a lot. 

I’m Indian of origin ( not entirely )  and my favorite series of all time is Berserk. There is an evil, demonic Hindu empire in that story, but it doesn’t matter because it’s easy to see Miura don’t think Indians are actually demonworshipping sadist lunatics. And also, everybody is a fucked up, violent monster in this world.  

I’m sure there are tons of exception in 80s ova schlock. But out of the big franchises they’re pretty well written and treated like real characters. 

I don’t think japanese are known for being super tolerant or anything and they would probably seem ignorant to a westerner. But they also don’t profess to the same type of racism as here, where everything is a loaded topic and race pretty much defines who you are in the eyes of people for whom it matters. Which I think is probably why dark skinned people are treated as real characters and not vehicles for hypocritical Hollywood liberals and hack SJW writers to advance their career.  As a side note I hate the word people of color. It makes my skin crawl and is just a way for white people to say “colored person” and get away with it. It’s like saying “muncher of curry” instead of “currymuncher” .

17,e46j9s8,"My step mom is from China. On the border between China and Myanmar. A lot of her family lived on the Myanmar side and were unfortunately part of the war. My step mom was lucky to be in China, because China put a stop to the war crossing the border so she was safe.

Burmese people have dark skin compared to Asians from the eastern side of China. My step mom was always extremely tan and it’s not true that this is a result of them doing hard labor. Even though she worked outside in the farm her whole life, when she came to the states and started being a SAHM, her skin didn’t lighten very much. And when my brother was born (half pasty white guy, half dark skinned Asian girl) he was still pretty dark. If you’re not sure what kind of skin I’m talking about, it’s [this](https://www.gomyanmartours.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Burmese_People.jpg) 

So, it’s way more than just “poor people are tan because they’re in the sun all day”. No, Burmese people are a different race than the people from eastern China. They’re looked down upon, yes, because they’re generally poor farmers, but also because they’re a different race. The people of Kachin, where my step mom is from, are like one big family. They understand that they’re different. In fact, there’s a race war going on right now that affects them all because of their family ties to Burma (Myanmar).

Look at the Burmese people and then look at the women China puts in magazines. It’s not coincidence. Light skin is “pretty”. Dark skin means you’re old, poor, generally just not as good of a human being. There’s even a thing in China where if you have a dark labia or dark vaginal skin it makes you a slut. They say skin darkens with “use”. Dark skinned people are used up.

Now look at how it is in America. Why are black people looked down upon? Not simply because we don’t like their skin color, but because we think that skin color represents something deeper. If you’re black, you’re poor, you’re violent, you use drugs. It’s the same trope. Classism is racism. 


Edit: also, when I told kids in my class that my step mom was from China they asked if I spoke Chinese now. I told them she doesn’t speak Chinese... they told everyone I spoke Chinese after that lol (they didn’t even like me why lie in my favor wtf lol)

There are many languages in China and some people, like my step mom, speak no Chinese at all. She speaks multiple western Chinese languages. The main one is Jing Pho which has less than 100,000 native speakers in the world."
18,dzxty6m,"&gt;Post literally one thing showing her to be a white supremacist. I guarantee you can't because there's nothing to indicate she is except your own opinion.

I already explained this. She calls herself a ""cultural supremacist""  which is a coded phrase meaning white supremacists. She thinks only culture which came from white cultures is valid and that all other cultures need to be erased.

She attributes all advances in humanity to white people. She thinks dark skinned people hold humanity back. She thinks dark skinned people are violent, rapists, and murderers.

Wathila ibn Al-Asqa’ reported: I said, “O Messenger of Allah, is it part of tribalism that a man loves his people?” The Prophet said:
لَا وَلَكِنْ مِنَ الْعَصَبِيَّةِ أَنْ يُعِينَ الرَّجُلُ قَوْمَهُ عَلَى الظُّلْمِ
No, rather it is tribalism that he supports his people in wrongdoing.
Source: Sunan Ibn Majah 3949, Grade: Hasan

Love for one’s people is normal and healthy if it leads to good deeds, but such love that comes at the expense of justice is no true love at all.

Tribalism by this definition has been rejected by Islam in the harshest terms. Tribalism is a form of “blind following” whose adherents live in “ignorance,” an allusion to the pre-Islamic worship of idols.

Jundab ibn Abdullah reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:
مَنْ قُتِلَ تَحْتَ رَايَةٍ عِمِّيَّةٍ يَدْعُو عَصَبِيَّةً أَوْ يَنْصُرُ عَصَبِيَّةً فَقِتْلَةٌ جَاهِلِيَّةٌ
Whoever is killed under the banner of blind following, who calls to tribalism or supports tribalism, then he has died upon ignorance.
Source: Sahih Muslim 1850, Grade: Sahih

The Prophet disowned anyone who lives by the ideology of tribalism or supports it in any way. Tribalists might be outwardly Muslims, but in reality Allah will not count them among the true believers.
Jubair ibn Mut’im reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:
لَيْسَ مِنَّا مَنْ دَعَا إِلَى عَصَبِيَّةٍ وَلَيْسَ مِنَّا مَنْ قَاتَلَ عَلَى عَصَبِيَّةٍ وَلَيْسَ مِنَّا مَنْ مَاتَ عَلَى عَصَبِيَّةٍ
He is not one of us who calls to tribalism. He is not one of us who fights for the sake of tribalism. He is not one of us who dies following the way of tribalism.
Source: Sunan Abu Dawud 5121, Grade: Hasan

The Prophet delivered an instructive parable to use about the likeness of one who adheres to tribalism:
Abdullah ibn Mas’ud reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:
مَنْ أَعَانَ قَوْمَهُ عَلَى ظُلْمٍ فَهُوَ كَالْبَعِيرِ الْمُتَرَدِّي يَنْزِعُ بِذَنَبِهِ
Whoever supports his people in oppression is like a dead camel that falls into a well and is pulled out by its tail.
Source: Musnad Ahmad 4141, Grade: Sahih

The tribalist who falls into this sin is destroyed, just like a camel that plunges to his death inside a well. The corpse of his sin will poison the well for an entire town, while the townspeople must endure the hideous sight and stench as they remove his carcass from their drinking water. Like the rotting camel, all throughout history we have seen the deadly presence of tribalism in oppression, murder, and genocide.

Tribalism takes many different forms, but the mindset is always the same. When tribalists justify themselves in terms of race, this is classic biological racism. Sometimes tribalists justify themselves in terms of culture, claiming their culture must dominate others, in which case they are simply practicing cultural racism.

Religion itself can be used to construct and justify an ideology of tribalism. If religion is used to violate the human rights of others and rationalize injustice against out-groups, it has become nothing more than religious racism.

Rather, the religion of Islam teaches us to uphold the rights of all human beings, to walk with humility, and to leave the divine judgment to Allah alone. Even our enemies deserve their basic human rights. In this regard, Allah informs us about the story of Moses, peace be upon him, when he accidentally killed the Egyptian man. Moses felt regret and sought forgiveness for his mistake, although the Egyptians at the time were oppressing the Israelites under the Pharaoh.
  
The method of tribalism is to issue blanket indictments of an entire race, culture, religion, or group of people. They will condemn an entire group for the crimes of a few, or misrepresent an entire group by only examining its worst elements. Thus, the purveyors of Islamophobia claim all Muslims are terrorists, the purveyors of anti-Semitism claim all Jews are supremacists, and the purveyors of racism claim dark skinned people are natural criminals. In every case, the tribalists construct a false caricature of their victims to be the straw man for their vicious attacks.

Islam teaches us to reject such blanket indictments and false generalizations. Some of the Prophet’s companions began to have bad thoughts about all of the Jews and Christians, but verses were revealed making clear distinctions the righteous and unrighteous.

Allah said:
لَيْسُوا سَوَاءً  مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ أُمَّةٌ قَائِمَةٌ يَتْلُونَ آيَاتِ اللَّهِ آنَاءَ اللَّيْلِ وَهُمْ يَسْجُدُونَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ وَيُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْخَيْرَاتِ وَأُولَٰئِكَ مِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ وَمَا يَفْعَلُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلَن يُكْفَرُوهُ  وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِالْمُتَّقِينَ
They are not all the same. Among the people of the Book is a community standing in obedience, reciting the verses of Allah during the night and prostrating in prayer. They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to do good deeds. Those are among the righteous. Whatever good deeds they do will never be denied, for Allah knows well the righteous.
Surat Ali Imran 3:113-115

It would be wrong to negatively stereotype an entire religious group with all its unique individuals and diverse interpretations. For this reason, the Prophet firmly censured the poets of his time who had a habit of excoriating entire tribes.

Aisha reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:
إِنَّ أَعْظَمَ النَّاسِ فِرْيَةً لَرَجُلٌ هَاجَى رَجُلًا فَهَجَا الْقَبِيلَةَ بِأَسْرِهَا
Verily, the greatest of people in falsehood is a man who insults another man by disparaging the entire tribe.
Source: Sunan Ibn Majah 3761, Grade: Sahih
In another narration, the Prophet said:
إِنَّ أَعْظَمَ النَّاسِ جُرْمًا إِنْسَانٌ شَاعِرٌ يَهْجُو الْقَبِيلَةَ مِنْ أَسْرِهَا
Verily, the greatest criminal among people is a poet who disparages the entire tribe.
Source: al-Adab al-Mufrad 870, Grade: Sahih
If we accept blanket indictments of an entire group, then we are making a claim of collective guilt that will ultimately lead to collective punishment, and collective punishment is a crime of war. Islam rejects collective guilt and punishment, in word and deed, as innocent people may never be held accountable for the crimes of others.
Allah said:
وَلَا تَكْسِبُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ إِلَّا عَلَيْهَا وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ
No soul earns anything except it is upon itself, and none shall bear the burdens of another.
Surat Al-An’am 6:164
Abdullah ibn Mas’ud reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:
وَلَا يُؤْخَذُ الرَّجُلُ بِجَرِيرَةِ أَبِيهِ وَلَا بِجَرِيرَةِ أَخِيهِ
No man is to be punished for the crimes of his father or his brother.
Source: Sunan An-Nasa’i 4131, Grade: Sahih
Hence, tribalism is the ideological core of all militant terrorists, regardless of whether they support state terrorism or renegade terrorism. The Prophet renounced anyone who fights for tribalistic reasons and who eschews the principle of non-combatant distinction in war.
Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:
وَمَنْ قَاتَلَ تَحْتَ رَايَةٍ عُمِّيَّةٍ يَغْضَبُ لِعَصَبَةٍ أَوْ يَدْعُو إِلَى عَصَبَةٍ أَوْ يَنْصُرُ عَصَبَةً فَقُتِلَ فَقِتْلَةٌ جَاهِلِيَّةٌ وَمَنْ خَرَجَ عَلَى أُمَّتِي يَضْرِبُ بَرَّهَا وَفَاجِرَهَا وَلاَ يَتَحَاشَ مِنْ مُؤْمِنِهَا وَلاَ يَفِي لِذِي عَهْدٍ عَهْدَهُ فَلَيْسَ مِنِّي وَلَسْتُ مِنْهُ
Whoever fights under the banner of one who is blind, raging for the sake of tribalism, or calling to tribalism, or supporting tribalism, and is killed in this state will have died upon ignorance. Whoever rebels against my nation, striking the righteous and wicked alike and sparing not even the believers and he does not fulfill the pledge of security, then he has nothing to do with me and I have nothing to do with him.
Source: Sahih Muslim 1848, Grade: Sahih

When the connection between tribalism and terrorism is understood, it will not be difficult for you to see that every violent extremist group, whether white supremacists or Kharijite terrorists or others, all share the same basic tribalist ideology even though they express it in different terms.
In sum, Islam rejects all forms of tribalism, racism, and bigotry. We must not construct a false caricature of other groups in order to justify oppression, blanket indictments, and collective punishment against them. We must take the lead in upholding justice and the natural rights of not only Muslims, but of all human beings."
21,dk4uzi2,"Cherry picking is discussing unarmed people to frame something. This is not the threshold for deadly force. If you go this deep then you need to look into other variables like crime rate of area (more on edge than in countryside), time of day (dark skinned people are harder to see at night), and the criminal history of the suspect (black people more likely to have a violent history, so officers might approach differently).

It's fair to discuss these variables, but you can't dismiss a general argument with one that is clearly dependent on others.

Are police officers dicks because they like power, or because that's the optimal strategy for self-preservation in America?

I've seen racism of all kinds growing up in a very liberal court system. Look up Dale Akiki and Sagon Penn. One guy got labeled a paedo for looking a certain way, and the other got away with murder because the jury was stacked with actual peers of his that turned a blind eye. Bias is human nature, it does exist, but you can't shout down people because it gets in the way of the narrative you believe in.

"
22,dhe2wap,"Poor women, women from minority racial and religious groups, immigrant women, women with a history of substance abuse or mental health problems, abuse survivors, etc., - want to pull the numbers and see what the rates of criminality are for all of them?

I'm willing to bet that depending on how you manipulate the data, you could make it look like it's a lot higher than the general average. And in some cases those rates might actually be higher than average - especially since ""crime"" also includes survival crime like theft and prostitution, and crime associated with poverty and abuse like drug use.

Hell, any demographic that is consistently treated like shit is likely to have higher than average rates of crime. I guess that just proves that these demographics are inherently criminal, because clearly it couldn't be that widespread discrimination and abuse against them might possibly be causing the problem.

So are alt-right fears about minority women, Muslim women, homeless women, ""urban"" women, etc, justified? Maybe Muslims are just inherently violent, and dark skinned people are inherently prone to criminality, and we shouldn't dismiss the fear of ~~alt-right~~ white supremacist nationalist nazi women as being ""hysterical"" when they say that allowing these ""women"" into their communities endangers their safety!"
23,dhlykgy,"You're right. Dark-skinned people are more likely to be the victims of violent crime than whites. On the other hand, women are much *less* likely to be the victims of non-sexual violence than men. For example, about 75% of murder victims in the US are male. And with sexual violence, most of it occurs on dates or within relationships, not strangers on the street.

Oh, and don't even try to pull the ""But that's male on male violence!"" or ""but those are mostly gangsters shooting each other!"" card. That is literally *identical* to the rhetoric conservatives use to dismiss the higher rates of violence against ethnic minorities.

Either profiling men as violent criminals is wrong, or profiling ethnic minorities as violent criminals is okay. You can't have it both ways."

Bigotry against black people poisons the Arab world, too

' Day after day, week after week, the cars pulled up outside the Ethiopian embassy in Beirut and ejected their passengers: tired-looking black women, their modest possessions stuffed into cheap suitcases (pictured). With the economy in free fall, many Lebanese families could no longer afford to pay their domestic workers. Nor could they easily send them home. The price of repatriation flights had surged because of covid-19. So their solution was to dump the women outside their embassy. Dozens were left to fend for themselves.
The protests in America over racism and police brutality have drawn much interest in the Middle East. Some people reacted with shock, some with Schadenfreude. For others, though, America’s unrest was an opportunity to discuss the problems with race in their own countries.

Most Arab states have a black minority. Black communities in north Africa trace their roots to antiquity: the Nubians, for example, called Egypt home long before their country acquired its Arab identity. In the Levant and the Gulf many people are the descendants of slaves taken by Islamic empires, or of African Muslims who made pilgrimages east and decided to stay.

All face discrimination. Dark-skinned people are referred to with terms like abd (“slave”). Egypt’s dark-skinned former president, Anwar Sadat, was called his predecessor’s “black poodle”. Blackface is a common sight on Arabic television. In a widely shared video a black Palestinian actress, Maryam Abu Khaled, recounted the casual bigotry she encounters, such as a mother telling her daughter to get out of the sun lest she, too, turn black.

Skin colour can make marriages fraught when families see it as a marker of socioeconomic status or pedigree. Discrimination exists in the workplace, too. Black Iraqis, a community with more than a thousand years of recorded history, struggle to get government jobs and are typically relegated to menial work.

The worst treatment, though, is reserved not for citizens but for migrants. In wealthy Gulf states it manifests in a tacit racial hierarchy. Fancy hotels might employ black migrants as security guards or porters. They are less common in jobs that require interaction with customers, like waiters or hairdressers. Those better-paid roles often go to lighter-skinned workers from Asian or Arab countries.

25,fz3q41x,""" Most Arab states have a black minority. Black communities in north Africa trace their roots to antiquity: the Nubians, for example, called Egypt home long before their country acquired its Arab identity. In the Levant and the Gulf many people are the descendants of slaves taken by Islamic empires, or of African Muslims who made pilgrimages east and decided to stay.

All face discrimination. Dark-skinned people are referred to with terms like *abd* (“slave”). Egypt’s dark-skinned former president, Anwar Sadat, was called his predecessor’s “black poodle”. Blackface is a common sight on Arabic television. In a widely shared video a black Palestinian actress, Maryam Abu Khaled, recounted the casual bigotry she encounters, such as a mother telling her daughter to get out of the sun lest she, too, turn black.

Skin colour can make marriages fraught when families see it as a marker of socioeconomic status or pedigree. Discrimination exists in the workplace, too. Black Iraqis, a community with more than a thousand years of recorded history, struggle to get government jobs and are typically relegated to menial work.

The worst treatment, though, is reserved not for citizens but for migrants. In wealthy Gulf states it manifests in a tacit racial hierarchy. Fancy hotels might employ black migrants as security guards or porters. They are less common in jobs that require interaction with customers, like waiters or hairdressers. Those better-paid roles often go to lighter-skinned workers from Asian or Arab countries.

26,fw3l44g,"I just want to add my two cents as a South Asian woman. There's a lot of bias towards ""fair"" people in our culture. 

In movies dark skinned people are usually cast as the villains/goons. 

I know a very open minded woman who's at the height of her career. She regularly gets her skin bleached to get a fairer complexion (her skin darkened due to menopause). 

There's a movie in which the mother of a dark skinned girl treats her fair skinned niece (who she's adopted since she was orphaned) treats the fair skinned girl badly (no abuse or anything) just because the niece is more beautiful than her own daughter. 

A friend of mine in university had gotten tanned before her brother's wedding and she told me she'd have to go through a full de-tanning procedure to look good for the wedding. 

With the whole pandemic situation a neighbor of mine commented that it must be nice to not have to worry about catching too much sun. 

Fair and Lovely and other such products just add to the obsession and bias people have towards ""fair"" skin. These companies spread colorism (don't know if that's a word) to sell more products, especially when they show fair skinned individuals being more successful in ads. 

Almost every major skincare brand in India will have a fairness line. Makeup shop assistants will automatically match you for one shade lighter foundation/concealor, makeup artists will emphasize how they'll make your skin ""glow"", and if you get slightly tanned people will definitely mention it. Skin bleaching is a service that's commonly available in most ladies salons.

I sometimes get caught up in the biases because I have some pigmentation issues. But I also love the sun too much and I love how I look when I'm slightly tanned. I definitely use sunscreen, but tanning can't be prevented completely.

I love the way skin changes colors with the season. Our skin changes with the seasons, just like trees, and I find that there's beauty in that."
27,f452guz,"Oh dang, I'm sad I'm a little late to this one! My 2 best friends are Mormon and I worked at a Mormon-owned video game company for a while. I spent a lot of time hanging out with my friends at their Young Women's youth group and Singles Ward as a kid/teen. Here goes!

* Dark skin was a curse from God to punish and 'mark' one of the first tribes of people as sinners (the Lamanites). Today's dark-skinned people are viewed as carrying the same curse, because they are believed to descend from these original sinners.

* If a married couple wants to use birth control for any reason, they need to meet with the Bishop of their congregation so he can pray over it and give them his decision. Spoiler alert, it'll probably be no.

* There is quite the debate on the whole ""can't drink coffee"" thing. It's not actually caffeine that is frowned upon in the Book of Mormon, it's any hot beverage. I've met a ton of Mormons who had no problem drinking iced coffee, iced tea, and caffeinated sodas but would refuse hot coffee or hot tea. It seemed like there are some Mormons who eschew all caffeine anyway, and then use this to act like they're better than everyone... that was the impression I always got anyway. 

* Utah has the highest rate of drug abuse (prescription pills) in the entire country. Addiction is something MANY of my Mormon and ex-Mormon friends struggle with well into their 30s, now.

* MANY Mormons secretly drink alcohol in their homes. But they would never drink in front of a fellow church member (the old ""Why do you take 2 Mormons fishing?"" joke comes to mind)

* There is a pretty big rift between Mormons who support gay marriage and those who don't. A lot of Mormons are much more progressive than you would think (at least here in Washington State) and some have threatened to leave the church if they don't change their stance on homosexuality.

* If you're a man who hasn't served on a mission, you are, as JRod would say, going to be SEVERELY looked down on

* On the first Sunday of the month, everyone is encouraged to 'bear their testimony' in front of the congregation. Maybe it's just a local thing but I was told that whatever you shared during this time would absolutely be made fun of and ripped apart behind your back later. Anecdotally, Mormons especially women are some of the cattiest, most judgmental, gossipy-behind-your-back people I've ever met in my life. They are constantly trying to retain their footing on the moral high ground and love to look down on other church members.

* It's widely joked within the church that the only reason Mormon women go to college is to get their ""M.R.S degree""

* Adults are encouraged not to watch R-rated movies. My boyfriend had a Mormon coworker who, any time they would start talking about movies, would brag that he had never seen an R-rated movie in his life. He was 35.

* BYU students have a strict curfew (8PM I think?) and are not permitted to have members of the opposite sex in their apartments/homes after a certain hour and NEVER in any bedroom (so definitely no boys allowed in a girls dorm at any time). If they get caught breaking these rules, they can be expelled for life.

* They don't believe in the cross

* It's EXTREMELY difficult to officially leave the church. Missionaries do frequent home visits to inactive church members and it can take years and years for them to leave you alone. From what I hear, you can forget about having your name ever removed from the official membership list.

* The Mormon Church took it upon themselves to baptize Hitler. They don't believe he is in hell. 

&amp;nbsp;

And a personal story about one of my formerly VERY Mormon friends. Due to an argument with her mentally and verbally abusive husband, she went into labor at 26 weeks. The husband was then killed in a car accident 2 days after she gave birth. They would not permit her to seek accredited medical counseling or therapy, only faith-based church counseling. And they would NOT allow her to be unsealed from her first abusive husband when she remarried years later. (it's believed that whoever you are sealed to, is who you will be with for eternity in the afterlife. And as a kicker, women can't be sealed to more than one man, but men can be sealed to more than one woman...) So it was at this point that her and her second husband left the church and are now attending non-denominational services and living an awesome fun life with wine and coffee and birth control and all that fun stuff :)"
28,etsnqnb,"My own false beliefs and those of my collective self are always represented within the themes I've explored.

In what you've written here, I've seen so many gut wrenching false beliefs which could manifest in so many different topical and dramatic treatments.

For instance, you're exposed to the false beliefs which can manifested as someone lightening the skin complexion, even when they themselves can hold privilege over someone with a darker tone. Could that some rationale push someone to other manifestations which abuse their privilege?

Could someone engage in bullying people who are darker to try to court favor and inclusion with the lighter (or white) people in their social environment?

Could they be culpable in getting themselves cut by a darker peer and then hide behind the ""dark skinned people are mean"" excuse while they leave out the next forty years of their life behind a lie with no character growth?

Could someone suffer mentally from being forced to pass as straight? Could that person shun allegiance with someone who is out and suffering socially for it while they hide behind that privilege?

If you're a singer, you have the vocal range you have. If you want to do the most beautiful work you can, you need to respect and protect your voice. You can help someone else write for their voice, but that's not your voice and it may not sound the same if you sing it in your own voice, Particularly, if to do so would be too high or low for the nuance masterfully explored in the original voice you wrote for.

Mentor people who have a different, captivating voice to present their own stories for those issues which are foreign to you yet you want to see explored to their fullest rather than ghostwriting for people who don't exist in your world."
29,eczhhxr,"&gt; No, but implying that someone's point is invalid if they are emotional around a subject is derailing at its finest. You've done a lot of that in your responses and I've chosen not to dignify it with a response.

It's not merely because you're emotional. It's because you literally disregarded everything I said and just responded back with emotions. How is that a valid argument? Is that how you respond to the consequences you face in real life? With just emotions? It's not bad to be emotional but this is not the time and place to become too emotional to the point when you just ignore everything someone says just because you want to do it and you don't agree. Furthermore, you never responded directly to anything I said. You can't respond to everything with ""Dark skinned women are oppressed."" when I literally already know this and it doesn't address the argument. 

&gt;This is due to the fact that your responses read like someone who has an intellectual understanding of colorism, but no real-world experience with it.

No it's due to me not *agreeing* with you. It doesn't mean I don't have real world experience with it. For all you know, I could be darker than even *you*. Just because I share the same experiences with you doesn't mean I will respond in the same way or have the same solutions. Why rob me of my individuality just to decrease your cognitive dissonance? Plus, **if I'm already here, I obviously do know about colorism, since thats a common topic here. You're not the first woman to say this and you surely won't be the last.**

&gt;That's not what I'm saying. I am saying that I support her in creating a space that centers the experiences of ds women. I understand that some people feel that her vetting process is problematic and I can see/understand both sides of that argument. **At the end of the day I believe that she will do more good than harm, and I respect the means she has deemed necessary to achieve that end.**

You clearly don't understand both sides of the argument if you're still here getting emotional in my face as if I personally attacked you and going on a spiel about colorism when it doesn't address the argument. The crux of what I'm saying is I believe she will do more harm than good, not only to her audience but to herself. She's  only fueling ignorance about the opinions of black people by thinking that dark skinned women only safe spaces are impenetrable and not subject so abuse by dark skinned women themselves. Dark skinned women are not inherently saints, despite their struggles, and newsflash, they don't all have the same exact struggles, so even if she screens by skin tone, she is *not* screening by mindset, which is clearly her aim here.

&gt;I never said that and I don't see where anyone here implied anything close to that.

You did the minute you vetted her process and said it would keep trolls or derailers out. You act as if dark skinned women are incapable of contributing to the problem. As I said, they're not saints. No one is. Treat them like it. **Do not judge someone by the content of their skin, but the content of their character.** If you weren't implying it would be a utopia of peace, you can't have it both ways. You can't say it would be less content to derailing and then say it wouldn't be a utopia of peace at the same time. 

&gt;It goes without saying that she'll have to deal with the ever-present hassles of moderating an online group, but this will weed out a lot of fakers trying to get into the group and her method of vetting members will save her a lot of time/headache in the long run.

As I said that's where you're wrong. Anyone can just get a picture of dark skin from Google, or from their family or friends. Dark skinned people are not a unicorn. In fact, this process is prone to  fakers. If you read what I suggested, that would actually be less prone to fakers because you have to do a lot more work in filling out an application than just taking a simple picture and saying ""hey I'm dark skinned"". If she's trying to take shortcuts like this, she has no business running a forum. Getting moderators to help her with the platform she has should be no problem either. I've been on multiple forums and the best forums were the ones where the administrators were actively involved. 

&gt;No, it's really about how much time/energy I want to give to a stranger on the internet. 

Yet you invested a bunch of time and energy quoting and replying to me. Besides, how is giving time and energy to judging a *complete stranger's* skin tone any better? A stranger whom *you* know nothing about. 

&gt;You're also mistaken in the assumption that I care about 'being right.

If you don't care about being right, you would have actually address everything I said in the first place and wouldn't have tried to cover up by saying that I'm derailing. I wouldn't say it's mistaken because you clearly don't *want to be wrong*.

&gt;I mean, to be fair I'd like to be heard--hence taking the time to clarify my points--but it's not going to impact me if I am not, and **I honestly don't care if you agree or disagree.**

If you didn't care if I agreed or not, then why waste so much of your precious time and energy? Why go on an irrelevant spiel about colorism? Why pretend like *you're* the victim and as if I'm wasting *your* time. Everything you've said has amounted to ""poor me and poor dark skinned women"". Just because you care doesn't mean its going to significantly impact your life either. However, you do a pretty bad job at trying to be neutral while ignoring my side of the argument. It seems you can't reciprocate with the time and energy I am investing into expressing *my* side?

30,e5u0cm0,"Yes I've been to Singapore. They are completely different from Middle East Muslims. A lot more secular, there is also a significant Hindu population there as well as other religions. All of which seem to coexist nicely.

Middle Eastern Muslims treat women and foreign workers (who are not white) like shit. I've seen them abuse them openly on the streets. It's sad. They respect white men as equals but dark skinned people are abused and treated poorly. 

It's basically what Libertad Americans think is happening in America, they have no idea what kind of shithole these Muslim immigrants want to turn America into, it's their worst nightmare but they refuse to see it because ""muh precious minority!!"" Virtue signal."
31,e48l2bo,"The orders came in. Upvotes to the left. Obviously there were no comments on the Catholic Church rampant abuse of power, either. Just because here dark-skinned people are involved the alt-reich is in full swing. Don't think for a second that your agenda is not showing. "
32,e0zwy81,"Well, to begin with, it is wrong to say Brazilians are black people. Historically Brazil has been through the process of Miscegenation. In Brazil it’s very rare to see a person 100% black or 100% white. This is true to such an extent that foreigners who are totally white or totally black stand out in crowded places.

About the sausages, I think it is a little bit racist because the humor relies on the fact that Brazilian’s skin tones usually are darker than Germans’. What I mean is, of course, Brazilians’ skin tone is different than the average Germans’, however this is a fact, not a joke. Unless you consider the white ones to be better, there is no reason for it to be funny.

And this is without touching the subject of WHY the german population is white in the first place. 

Racism is a huge problem within Brazil. In poor areas, such as slums, police abuse is very common, specially targeting dark skinned people. Also, at job interviews, prison sentencing, racial stereotypes and so on, dark-skinned people suffer from racism on a daily basis. That’s why it’s such a delicate topic.

This sort of joke reinforces the mentality that dark-skinned people are worse somehow and escalates the racial problems everywhere.

About the 7x1 part, of course I would take it as a joke and not be offended by it at all."
33,drpbm66,"One of the more unusual elements to questions like these is how often the participants deny the already-is and act like we are debating the ought-to-be. Racism isn't nearly so strongly the position of white nationalists so much as the air we all breathe and the fashion in which the world functions. China is for the Chinese and is wildly racist against dark-skinned people, for example. Look at India. When other posters comment something like ""we seem to exist in society fine"", this observation to large extent discounts how little we coexist at all. Dark-skinned people are and have always been heavily segregated from lighter skinned people. People cite absurd exceptions like the occasional time and place or circumstance, like Barack Obama, or some quantity of multicultural aristocrats existing during the Roman Empire, but the bulk of ethnicities in the world *are* segregated. Black people in the United States lost *half their wealth* in the financial crash of 2008-2009, and barely anyone discussed it. There is a heavy amount of normalization going on constantly within race itself: black people didn't talk about it, either, and they didn't bring consequences upon the Democratic party.

People like Jared Taylor both are and aren't excessive, unnatural freaks, depending on your philosophical position. They are people who awkwardly speak out loud what everyone is thinking, and take the fact that everyone is thinking the same thing to an even more excessive and immoral position. And society's reaction is much like a public debate on spanking: everyone did it and probably it was dealt with as a fairly ordinary thing for all of human history (lightly abusing children, that is), but because we fear abusing children so broadly, the subject is spoken of in hushed tones and with terror or approbation. 

Why? Well, it's just how we're built. This is how we view morality, we abuse the abuse, we run from the category itself. We abolished child labor, and we have no great cogent argument for why adults should do the same nightmarish jobs we protect children from, nor why adults and children are OK to take those jobs overseas from us; nevertheless, we cannot speak rationally about the subject. Children can and do participate in labor when the need is there. Yet naturally we are obsessed with them as a receptacle of our goodness. And now, as our divorce rates are high and we have less children, we tell ourselves we figured it all out morally, because we don't now allow 14 year olds to have children or ""serious relationships"". So it goes with race: we want to be Good, so we want racism not to exist, and we mistake that argument for Not Being Racist. Someone like Jared Taylor disturbs people by basically inverting that position, concluding something bizarre like Racism Definitely Exists and Endures, So It Must Be Important.

What in the hell is my point? Basically, if you want to do better philosophy, stop talking and thinking about racism like it's this weird proposal placed freshly on the table and start recognizing how ubiquitous and successful it always is as an underlying framework for the world already. Racism cannot be ""justified"" - it is one of the pillars of our very existence. Racism needing justification is a statement as unusual as suggesting sex needs justification. Like sex, racism is something which, under various circumstances and to varying degrees, quite simply *is*.

Have you ever read that traffic jams are caused by an additional 10-20% of traffic, not by what we suspect, which is something more like a 200% increase? It's just the additional fractional amount which slows everything down. I think of racist ideologues the same way. Their position is generally something like 10% more racist than everyone else's. Which is why they are the thermometer reading of a constant ongoing problem (civilization and resource management and encroaching threats of ethnic/nationalist war) much more than they are ""wrong"" or ""insane"".

The cure for racism isn't anti-racism. The cure is having enough abundance to allow people to pretend racism doesn't exist."
34,dw3r0fb,"&gt;I need some help from a atheist

&gt;(THIS IS NOT FOR AGNOSTICS) 

You seem confused about what those words mean.

There are people who believe in the existence of one or more supernatural beings called ""gods'. We call these people ""god-believers"". Or, if we want to use the greek-derived word, ""the-ists"".

Anyone who is not a god-believer, we call a god-not-believer, or in greek, an ""a-the-ist"".

There are people who claim a high enough degree of confidence in their belief as to whether or not gods exist to say that they **know** one way of the other. We call these people ""knowers"". Or, if we want to use the greek-derived word, ""gnost-ics"".

Anyone who is not a knower, we call a not-knower, or in greek, an ""a-gnost-ic"".

These terms are not mutually exclusive. Most atheists are agnostic. Most agnostics are atheist.

&gt;What exactly is the Big Bang?

A term describing the first few seconds of the universe-as-we-know-it, in which it expanded from a hyperdense singularity. Before that point, the physical laws we currently understand kind of break down.

&gt;How did it start?

No one knows for sure. For the current state-of-the-art of speculation, you should be asking a cosmologist.


&gt;How long ago was the Big Bang?

13.7 billion years.

&gt;How does the process of evolution happen?

Here's the five minute version of what you should have seen in your 9th Grade Biology textbook:

1. Within populations, individuals vary along certain traits. Some people are shorter, some are taller. Some moths are lighter, some are darker. Some bacteria can metabolize citrate without oxygen, some cannot.
2. At least some of this variation is heritable from parents to offspring. The children of tall people will likely be taller than the children of short people.
3. Sometimes, individuals with a certain trait have an easier time surviving and reproducing in a certain environment than individuals without that trait. For example, in a forest where all the trees have light bark, lighter moths will have an easier time blending in and avoiding predators. In a forest where the bark is all dark, the darker moths would have an advantage instead.
4. Given 2 and 3, if a trait is advantageous, more organisms with that trait will survive and reproduce, and the frequency of that trait within the population will increase in the next generation.
5. If the trait is advantageous enough, for a long enough period of time, then after many generations every organism in the population will have that trait. If there's so little sun that most dark-skinned people are vitamin D deficient, the population is going to get lighter. If there's so much sun that most  light-skinned people are getting skin cancer, the population is going to stay dark.
6. If this happens over and over again over a long period of time, you can end up with a [population of creatures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale) that look very different from [their ancestors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulocetus).

This is the result of simple rules applied over and over again for very long periods of time. It's a completely natural process. There's no need for a ""guiding mind"" anywhere in this process, any more than you need a guiding mind for a rock to roll downhill.

35,fqaf973,"Your mom is blowing smoke; you caught her wrongfooted with a contradiction in the bible, so she passed it off with, “well that’s different.” 

It also says homosexuallity is wrong, yet the KJV was put into circulation by a homosexual king. 
Yes, King James I was gay! 

The bible also says dark skinned people are inferior/cursed because of Noah’s son, Ham; that’s justification for fundamentalist types to push racist ideologies, because ‘the bible says these people are inferior.’

It also says murder is wrong, yet anecdotally advocates killing ‘witches’ (who were, at the time this verse was inserted, actually healers and midwives, not hags). 


It’s up to you to make your own decisions about these things, and to do the research for yourself. Your mom is not perfect, omniscient or infallible, so don’t assume she has all the answers.

When he said that he was the Chosen One, there’s a set of people who weren’t at all upset.  They got excited.  They said, “See?!  I knew it!” and were happy to have Trump himself confirm what they’ve suspected all along.  Those are the people Trump was talking to.

It’s like when he says that Nazis are fine people, or suggests that we should murder or deport Muslims, or that countries with a lot of dark-skinned people are “shit holes”.  Those aren’t gaffes.  He means what he said, and his fans are happy he’s saying it.

It’s an intentional strategy.  Say all the things his rabid fan base wants to hear, stirring them up to the point where they’re ready to murder all the nonbelievers.  Then, after the fact, pretend like he didn’t mean it, like it was taken out of context, like it was just a joke, or like he didn’t even really say it and the “mainstream media” is lying.

37,el92ko5,"It depends what you mean by barbaric. Is it wrong to expect justice against those who have taken lives? Why should murderers be rewarded with decent living conditions (what we would expect from a humane prison)? Is the objective to disincentivise people from murder or trivialise the crime? And if your argument is that they can be reformed, I would disagree in most cases of murder. However even if it were true, would society trust murderers out on the streets? Anymore than they trust pedophiles on the streets? And how is it justice to deprive the victims of justice against those who have wronged them and their family? If the family wants to forgive the murderer because it was an honest mistake and the murderer has sincerely repented and didn't want that outcome, I can believe that and do not believe the death penalty should be applied. However in extreme cases, for example where dark skinned people are being gunned down century after century for doing absolutely nothing wrong, where is your limit? History has shown the only time action gets taken against racism is when black communities rebel and smash up their plantations. And then to calm people down, they pass in token laws that change nothing but breed the same tensions that result in the same killings not long after.

Regardless though, I think it's best to just agree to disagree since we'll go on forever like this."
38,e2z8dc2,"Centrist means you think light skinned and dark skinned people are both humans, and race isn't the first and foremost issues that needs to be shoehorned into everything, like you just did by mentioning race---literally is no part of this discussion.  The far left are the ones fixated on race, I just want everyone treated equally.

I have no stance on abortion.   But I can understand some might consider it murder.  I don't, but I don't feel I have the right to tell someone they can't either.  Nevertheless, Roe V Wade is here to stay despite the fearmongering so it is totally a non issue to me (female of reproductive age here btw.)

The Russians who may have interfered with the election didn't do so to help Trump, the objective was to sow discord.

40,dw6gjtf,"&gt; After re-reading your latest comments, I don´t think we actually disagree on that much in terms of the current situation.

Glad to hear that we've found some common ground.

&gt; While I am aware of the Belgian Congo example and definitely agree with you assessment on that particular case, I just disagree on where the overall balance lies.

How so?  I'm still waiting to hear about all the ""massive benefits of ... colonial rule.""  Let's start with Congo, since you agree that there were colonial atrocities there.  How do you think that Congo ended up, cost-benefit wise, from colonialism?

&gt; I guess the issue is selective choice of moral standards for European colonizers, which you would not apply to local states and rulers.

I certainly hope I don't selectively choose moral standards based on my personal views/biases.  I do think that there's a difference between cruelties by a government in its own sovereign state vs. cruelties for fun abroad.  Again, context.  Hitler (or Napoleon, or Timur, etc.) ventured abroad to murder.  Suharto [stayed home] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965-1966).  So I do think that conquest is worse than internal repression in general - because the victims have no voice in the government, for one thing.  Agree?

&gt;  For example, I don´t think that British rule over India was more brutal or barbaric than that of local rulers in preceding centuries (and maybe less barbaric in some aspects). Yet, I doubt you would characterize entire history of pre-British India as a ""carnage"" in the same way you characterized the British colonial rule.

Again, I try pretty hard not to have double standards.

The British went abroad to take over India, which is bad.  And I'm not sure exactly what prior rulers you are referring to.  But not only were the British ruthless, using famine as a tool of oppression, they also bled Indian wealth dry:

&gt;During the Mughal Empire, India was the world leader in manufacturing, producing 25% of the world's industrial output up until the mid-18th century, prior to British rule. Due to its ancient history as a trading zone and later its colonial status, colonial India remained economically integrated with the world, with high levels of trade, investment and migration. India experienced deindustrialization under British rule, which along with fast economic and population growth in the Western World resulted in India's share of the world economy declining from 24.4% in 1700 to 4.2% in 1950, and its share of global industrial output declining from 25% in 1750 to 2% in 1900.
[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_India)

Remember what Columbus was looking for when he found the New World?  The riches of India.  Under British rule, India was impoverished, and is only now starting to come back strong.  Why aren't these facts already in general knowledge?  For the same reason that the Soviet mass rapes in 1945 Germany are not - history is written by the winner.  Antony Beevor, IIRC, estimated that as many as 2 million German women were raped by the Communists.  And think about this?  If a country as rich as Germany has a hard time getting the word out about atrocities it has suffered, how hard do you think it is for poor, third world countries to counter the propaganda juggernauts of world empires?

I would really love to read a fact-based analysis of what ""benefits"" India got from being colonized.  I am not a historian, and maybe I've been lead astray.

But I do try hard not to have double-standards.  The Japanese rape of Nanking, for example, was particularly brutal, and it was in the 1937 - pretty recently.  Japanese treatment of Chinese and Koreans
and Filipinos during that period is probably as bad as anything Hitler ever did. 

So I don't think that Western governments are alone in committing murder abroad.  And I don't think that dark-skinned people are the only victims.  What the British did to Ireland, for example, is probably worse than anything the Brits did to India - Ireland *still* isn't back to the population it had in 1845, pre-potato famine.

But remember, this thread is in response to a somewhat alarmist headline that there is a ""genocide"" going on in SA.  I find this ironic, given that there is *actually* a genocide taking place today, in 2017-18 in Yemen.

I do think that colonialism was, generally, evil.  The colonial powers didn't build railroads, for example, to help local populations, but to loot and pillage.  Each case is different.  And sometimes, sure, the subject peoples got some tangible benefit out of the arrangement.  But the brute facts are that in every case I've ever read about, colonial rule came at the barrel of a gun.  So I do believe that talk about ""benefits"" of colonialism is largely revisionist history.

But you know what?  I might be wrong.  

I would really appreciate if you could give me some examples where you suspect I might employ a double-standard - knowingly or unknowingly.  I am, for better or worse, kind of a genocide geek.  I read a lot about all sorts of atrocities.  And, believe it or don't, I am especially keen to read stuff that conflicts with my still-evolving world view.

For WW2 history, for example, I read Antony Beevor a lot - a relatively conservative (and excellent) British historian.  For current events, I read that liberal rag, The Economist :)

I can't guarantee that I'll agree with your arguments, and I certainly can't guarantee that I won't tick you off.  But I can promise that I will do my best to listen with an open mind, and to evaluate facts as neutrally as I can."
41,dtwdjhn,"&gt;That's a joke. You are getting offended by a lousy joke and compare it to literal mass-murder. 

Irony. Great reading comprehension. Also ""dark-skinned people are so not sexy that half of them are still virgins"" is a ""joke"" too, and it would get you fired at any normal company. I don't see how that helps your case, at all.

Moving on, I'm gonna post this ONCE AGAIN since you people are so goddamn thick-skulled.

A statement like that can make be true (not that this dev is particularly concerned with being ""truthful""). It can also be fucking racist as hell. The two are not mutually exclusive.

""N-ggers commit higher crime rates relative to other races. Kick them out."" -That's true, that person makes a point that's technically true. That person is also acting like a fucking racist. It doesn't fairly reflect *why* a group might commit higher rates of crime, it is not nuanced, it is expressing prejudice against a group.

""Black families are more likely to be in poverty than other racial groups in America."" - From the US Department of Housing and Urban development. This is an example of a not racist statement/ group making the statement. Simple, right? 

""Black families are more likely to be in poverty than other racial groups in America."" - From Stormfront or the KKK. Now, with the authors switched, the statement still isn't inherently racist, but BOY can you know for sure it was said with racist intent. 

The dev made a very negative statements against foreigners with a slight nuggets of truth. That slight nugget of truth means nothing. The statement is racist. It's not rocket science people. It's a dickish thing to say in the same way that ""you're a divorced loser who lost his family, haha!"" is a hurtful statement. What, because its ""honest"" you can't (or worse, SHOULDN'T) be fired for it? You people are so lacking in critical thinking its fucking scary. And then when you finally get called out on THAT bullshit, you go with the defense of ""well it wasn't racist because x minority thought it was funny!"" Just stop.

If you listen to reddit over the past few years, you'd think the only way you can actually be racist is to lynch black people while burning crosses 24/7."

46,fg7h22a,"OK, you asked for it  

1. The Mayans had stone boxes, like the Book of Mormon was found in.  

2. Mesoamericans had advanced written languages, some of which appear to be in Book of Mormon script.

3. Archaeology supports that millions of people lived in MesoAmerica - as the Book of Mormon suggests.

4. Archaeology supports the timetable that the Book of Mormon suggests. The Olmecs abandoned their cites at the same time as the Jaredites (400 BC).

5. The Olmecs built cities of cement, as did the Jaredites.

6. The system of weights and measures detailed in the Book of Mormon is still in use today.

7. The Book of Mormon says that there were towers throughout the land. It also talks of temples, palaces, and thrones. This is supported by archeology.

8. The Book of Mormon says that they had silk, barley, and copper, silver and gold. All have been found.

9. The Book of Mormon talks of a great earthquake that occurred at the death of Christ, and cities buried beneath the sea. A massive earthquake and volcanic eruption hit the Maya Highlands about 2000 years ago, according to anthropologists. Cities have been found “buried” in the ocean off the coast of Belize. There is also a legend of three days of darkness after the earthquake, when no fire could be lit, also in harmony with the scripture.

10. The Book of Mormon talks about swords that can be stained with blood. The Mayan had wooden swords. Wooden swords do get stained with blood.

11. The geography of the Book of Mormon matches Mesoamerica - this includes hundreds of geographic details.

12. The Book of Mormon talks about going to a mountain to prepare weapons for war. It turns out that they used obsidian for sharp edges, and there were only two sources - both in the mountains.

13. Hebrew and Semitic language elements have been found among the Maya. The Popul Voh has Semitic elements.

14. Geneologies of the Maya include Jawbone who came by boat with his family. The Hebrew word for Jawbone is Lehi, the prophet in the Book of Mormon who came to Mesoamerica about 580 BC.

15. The Mayans knew about the great flood and the Tower of Babel. They even suggest that the Tower of Babel was being built as a place of refuge from further flooding.

16. The Book of Mormon mentions horses. Recent finds include the bones of horses that pre-date Columbus.

17. The Book of Mormon suggests the vast majority of the genetic heritage would have come from the Jaredites, and the families that came with them. This cannot be refuted by genetic sampling, as we don’t know what their genetic makeup would even look like.

18. The Book of Mormon uses the phrase “river of water”. This is unnatural for anyone in the Western Hemisphere, but normal from a middle-Eastern perspective, where many rivers are wadis, or dry rivers.
19. The Book of Mormon contains many examples of chiasmus, a Hebrew literary device virtually unknown at the time of Joseph Smith.
20. The Book of Mormon contains examples of Topos lists, another ancient literary device.
21. Odd names like Lehi, Nephi, and Sam are found among the Arabians of Lehi’s day, as they are today.
22. Lehi’s journey through the Arabian desert is described in detail in the Book of Mormon, and the same places have been found by modern archaeologists. Some of the place names still exist, like NHM, or Nahom.
23. Many cities in the Book of Mormon were fortified with balustrades, moats, and walls. These have been found in Mesoamerican cities.
24. Chickens are mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Chickens were not thought to have existed in Mesoamerica until last year, when their bones were discovered at an archaeological dig.
25. Lehi named the site, where they buried Ishmael, Nahom, which in Hebrew means place of peace. This is an appropriate name for a resting place.
26. A large stone has been found which details the kings and wars of the Olmecs going back several generations. A similar stone was found by the people of Nephi, which recorded the kings and wars of the Jaredites.
27. Three miracles found in the Book of Mormon are without precedent in the Christian bible, but are found in the history of a Christian town that once existed in the Arabian peninsula, as recorded by muslims. They are the dodging of arrows, the speaking of a baby, and the inability of the wicked to stand in a confrontation with the servant of God.
28. An Arabian town called Dedan, through which Lehi probably passed on his way the sea, started calling themselves Lihiites at about time that Lehi passed through.
29. The three wise men, who probably came from southern Arabia, knew about the birth of the savior. Lehi prophesied about the birth of the Savior while he was still in Arabia, and gave the date of his coming. Frankenscense and Myrrth are both products that come exclusively from trees in southern Arabia.
30. Many examples of ancient script on metal plates have been found.
31. A tapestry hanging in the Museum of Anthropogy in Mexico City shows a man holding a spherical object going from place to place followed by the people who came with him out of the ocean. The device resembles the Liahona in the Book of Mormon, which was used to lead the people of Lehi from place to place. Liahona translates to compass or director. The device in the Mayan tapestry is known as the Giron Gagal which translates to compass or director.
32. Place names ending with ha or hah, in the Book of Mormon, are found near water. The Mayans also used this convention.
33. The Book of Mormon tells of the Jaredites and Nephites having steel. Traditionally, according to biblical usage, steel is a copper alloy, ususally bronze or brass. The word steel means hard, or durable. Bronze and brass were hard and durable metals. Hardened copper alloys have been found among the Mayans and Olmecs.
34. The Book of Mormon tells of the Nephites using iron. Tons of iron implements have been found.
35. The Book of Mormon tells of 14 stones that were touched by the finger of God to give light to the Jaredite ships. Jewish tradition holds that Noah’s ark was also lit by glowing stones.
36. The Book of Mormon describes populations well beyond what Lehi and his children could sired. Archaeology confirms that there were many people living in Mesoamerica when Lehi arrived.
37. Both light skinned and dark skinned people are described in the Book of Mormon, and they had many wars between them. Many murals among the Mayan ruins show warfare between dark and fair skinned people.
38. During the earthquake, new lakes appeared. Lake Ilopango in El Salvador is one such lake that scientists have dated to the time of Christ."

48,f0sl3h6,"Some look at the horizon and believe the earth is flat. Some look at a bull charging at a red cape and believe red enrages bulls. You cannot convince them otherwise. At a superficial glance and without taking the entire context into consideration, anyone can draw an indefinite amount of wrong conclusions.

Yes, anyone can read anything into whatever they want. Some read the Bible and are convinced it teaches that dark skinned people are inferior. Some read the Bible and are convinced it teaches it is ok to blow up a building. Neither of these are taught. Some have read the Bible and have greatly improved their lives and are much happier. Why the difference in comprehension? It depends on what a person really wants in their heart.

Pulling 1 verse out of over 31,000 and using that to form an opinion about someone is a bit disingenuous. The Hebrew word ra' (used for ""evil"" in the translation you are choosing to use) can mean “bad,” “gloomy,” “ugly,” “evil,” “calamitous,” “malignant,” “ungenerous,” and “envious,” depending upon the context. The context shows the word has the sense of calamity. Jonah 3:10 says that when the Ninevites repented, God changed his mind regarding the ra' (evil or calamity) he had planned to bring upon them as punishment. Same meaning. Eze 33:11 says that God takes no pleasure even in the death of the wicked, but rather gives them opportunities to turn back. Nowhere does the scriptures indicate God is the source of all evil. You perceive that because that is what you want.

You pull out of it what you want to pull out of it. Depends on what you really want in your heart."
49,erwwryr,"I feel my post will only be in vain in trying to explain this to you. So I'm going to make it as short as possible.

The children that are dying are often dragged through hostile terrain for days with poor health by their parents. They are not given proper healthcare and are usually beyond the constitutionally obligated aid of the U.S border guard. 

So when they do *die* under their medical care, it has to be officially recorded as a death on their watch and because of that, the circumstances are skewed as they're either unknown or not included in the report.

The other part is that a lot of immigrants have no documentation or papers to show where they were officially from. Policy is that if they find them and they have no documents to show, detain and process them in due time to ensure they don't simply just find a detour and slip into the United States.

When people arrive in a country without documents, it is against the law to send them anywhere else because their country of origin is unknown. They are detained until bureaucracy sorts itself out and decides the best course of action according to their government and the United Nations.

And this is the big, juicy but misinformed part. Supposed parents who are separated from their children often have no documents proving they are indeed the biological parents. And when they refuse to consent to DNA testing (because forcing them to do so is a human right violation) that brings a lot of suspicion upon them.

Human traffickers, drug traffickers and other such cartel members often use this tactic and for the most part, it works with forged documents. And because 9,000 people try to get in every year, some manage to slip by because of their appearance as a family unit.

This whole situation has become bigger because more people are trying to get in now. It's a bureaucracy and human rights nightmare. It's not as simple as you think it is and if anything, the U.S border guard is actually more humane than most of the world when it comes to this stuff.

Most countries I've been to will deliver three warning shots before engaging with total and utter discrimination until the targets are dead. If they find unarmed illegals, they detain them, often torture them if they feel like it and deport them to the nearest random country. 

That usually entails sending families to different countries broken up and alone. It's ridiculous. And some countries don't even let their detainees go. They die in captivity.

I understand that it is the mantra of the left to act like as if the U.S is a totalitarian dictatorship but it's the furthest thing from it. And it is the mantra of the right to act like as if immigrants and dark skinned people are the devil.

Both are fighting over tribalism and have no clue what actually goes on at the U.S borders. These are not fucking concentration camps, people are not being put into showers and gassed in an orderly fashion.

People are trying to illegally cross into a country without documents and refusing to tell the U.S their intentions. They are detained for it just like the policy of any other country in the world. Almost every country in the world has an official policy that is triggered when too many people attempt to cross their borders to do exactly what the U.S is doing right now.

And not to mention, this has been going on for decades. So to act like that orange buffoon is the main problem is playing into your obvious bias. 

You want to actually solve these problems? Start looking at how our civilization operates and what influences our society to do the things it does. Not screech at some orangutan who can't even count to ten.

Research shows that people are less likely to smile or sit next to indigenous people on the bus, pick indigenous people for jobs. 
Racist stereotypes affect people and influence people’s perceptions and ‘stereotype threat’ is also a thing. 

Then there’s the high incarceration rates, and death in custody rates.

53,do2f1x6,"It's easy why they hate us. It's a short, simple answer. But the explanation of the answer requires more. So why? WHY hate us so much? The same reason Jews are hated so much. The same reason blacks and hispanics are treated like evil monsters that one should hurt even at the cost of one's own life.

The Bible. Jesus.

That's it. By itself. Nothing else. No great schemes, no illuminati, no control methods. Just the Bible and Jesus.

Now the long answer: Mormon-influenced American Protestant Christianity. And this was birthed from Colonial era Christianity explained by pagans who didn't understand their own book to pagans who understood even less.

The Bible actually isn't against Homosexuality. The curse of Noah was never ever revealed, so it's not dark skin. Nobody knows what it was. Jews were never seen as evil or bad, there were people who honored G0D and those who did not.

Why hate Jews? Because Paul ""the Apostle"" hated Jews. But Paul hated the original Christians too. Because Peter and the Apostles caught him in lie after lie after lie. They hated him so much that they called him The Liar, and...the anti-Christ. Paul was humiliated by Jewish and Christian theologians, philosophers, or just people who knew their faith. And he got humiliated and his bullshit called on often. So, hed have a temper tantrum through the New Testament (which completely contradicts Jesus and Christianity completely) and when pagans who did not quite understand Christianity run to it through Paul's method, they started hating Jews because Paul hated Jews. That simple.

Why blacks, Hispanics, and dark people?
Because one day people were struggling to understand just what was the curse mark on Noah's son. The theories ran the gambit from dog heads to Little Person syndrome, to retardation, to albinism, to hermaphroditism, and so on. Well, the theory that won popular vote was dark skin, because Noah's son ran to Kush(Ethiopia), where dark skinned people are. So, instead of using common sense and realizing that the book never tells you what the mark is and that the man just so happened to run to a place that happened to be populated with dark skinned people, they had a fanatic gasm and started theorising, ON THEIR OWN, not backed by scripture in any way, that dark people are evil and cursed. And thus began the holy war on the Native American, the African, the Aborigine, and the Indian. And let's not forget the ""yellow devil"". Before anime, Asian people were among the most demonized, hated, and despised. And MANY, MANY, MANY Asians today still complain loudly about discrimination, glass ceilings, and problems. The weeaboo-born bullshit of ""Asians never suffer racial discrimination and succeed through hard work alone"" is complete bullshit. There was a time northern blacks were pointed to as ""succeeding just through hard work"" to counter the arguments by Natives, Asians and sometimes even immigrants. Color of the week, chosen by ignorant redneck living a delusional dream.

But what about gays?
Same knee-jerk hysteria without thinking reaction. The Bible itself and even Jesus, pushed to THINK before you do. You never ever take things like a child, you THINK and use your rationale. Even G0D Him/Her/Itself pushes this in the book of Isaiah (as well as contradicts the need for any death or a Jesus for your soul's salvation, thus negating Paul's claims completely, and making it easier to understand why the apostles despised him SO much). Well, the Bible says a man shouldn't lay with another man like a woman. Done.
But we must understand this is a historical text written in a region, time, place and among a culture so VERY foreign to our own. And ESPECIALLY, to Medieval European culture and concept. A man, should not get in a position a woman does when a man and a woman boink. Okay. That's it.
The commands, especially when historically broken down by Rashi's commentary, show they are VERY exact and tedious. There is no room for guess. If its not there, then its not bad.
There's nothing against gay marriage, nothing against oral sex, and probably is a thing relating to anal in a unhealthy way. Nothing against full blown Lesbianism either. And this is in a text that's very tedious about the do nots and super detailed. 

And the kicker in the end is that the worse abomination is a person who ostracizes another, and someone who doesn't give to someone too poor for things. THEY are the abominables.

And also, in the end, its a commandment that is what is wanted of you. But, if you dont obey it, then do your best to follow the other 612, which are pretty easy. Wash, keep clean, be nice, be studious, take care of your family, respect your friends, eat right, take care of your body, don't hurt animals needlessly, don't be wasteful, yadda yadda yadda.

Once a hard core education of these people's own book is given to them, and they are taught how painful and agonizing their actions are to other human beings, especially people their same race and nationality, then that's when progress can be made faster. Not atheism, because we see that doesn't fix the problem. If you're atheist, then great, do your thing. But religion shift wont fix a problem birthed by a religion. Education given to the miseducated is needed.

End of the day, if you're going to live by a book, then KNOW what the hell your book says.

54,dj4bct8,"&gt; I want to thank you for the video. I'm happy this isn't the standard Hippie bull crap video the religious types send me.

I'm glad you liked it.

&gt; So it's very interesting to think that this idea seems so contradictory to what I find ""rational"", yet also seems to make so much sense. 

I don't think it's contradictory to what you find rational. I think that you find rational whatever you can verify by experience, right? The same is true for me. It's just that we have different experiences.

&gt; But, I guess there are fears within me that prevent me from believing this in its entirety.

No, please don't *believe* anything. Believe **only** what you can verify by experience or experience firsthand. However, I would be happy if you don't close yourself to the possibility that we are not at the peek of our wisdom and that there are things which are only experienceable on the personal level, without the possibility of direct verification from an outside perspective. That is, maybe only measurable as brain states - but that doesn't mean they are not real. For example, your love for your family is real. It's not just some chemistry in your brain. It exists and you know it exists because you directly experience it. The difference of it to a personal delusion is - (almost) everybody is able to feel love. If it would be a delusion then most probably nobody would be able to experience it.

I think the only thing instead of believing you can maximally do is to aknowledge that we are not necessarily at the ""end of it all"" - not the final end product of evolution, not all-knowledgeable, do not have all the instruments to understand the world. Today we believe the one story, tomorrow this story will be considered short sighted.


&gt; If no model is capable of explaining reality itself, how do we know anything exists.

Because we experience it. An empirical scientist relies also on their experience as well, no? So, actually, experience is their primary tool. The difference between what that guy in the video calls ""enlightenment"" (I do not like this word and will say ""(experience of) onness"") and science is that scientific findings you can easily check - often if you have the necessary instruments. If you set up an experiment in most cases it will lead to the same result. However, though everybody can access that state of ""oneness"", nobody taught us at school to do so and we usually need to go privately and learn how to meditate (or maybe take the shortcut via psychodelica, but then you just get a glimpse into the state at most).

By the way, my answer was to the question ""How do we know anything exists"". Why do you believe that ""everything exists"" derives from the possibility of a model to describe it?

&gt; I do however have many questions for you.
Do you think there are many things that science considers ludicrous that may have truth in them?

Yes, I do. Well... ""many"". Let's say some.

But the question is what you consider by ""science"". Scientists are also not alll *that* uniform. Some of them even believe in god, as in ""bible god"".

I assume you also want to know some of the things ;)

* I know for the fact that the mind can influence the body and its surroundings - to a degree previously not assumed by the standard science. See foremost Tibetan monks. See Wim Hof, who can do ""tricks"" which would make standard humans die just by consciously concentrating on breathing. See the placebo effect. I don't know whether these things are recognized by the modern physicians, but I guess more and more they are.

* I conjecture from personal experience of ""oneess"" that there is such a thing like dissolving-into-the-""great-consciousness""-after-death. I can call it ""reincarnation"" for short, but I don't mean the reincarnation as in ""I am going to be reborn again"". Rather like that the concept of me disappears because it is tightly linked to my body and brain, but the information of me is forever part of the ""great consciousness"" which is everything. Many other living beings, plants, animals, humans will be reborn. That is, ""I"" will be reborn as all of them. And ""I"" will go on living, for example as you (assuming you live longer than me). And die and be reborn again. I know it sounds strange when one words it like that. This is my best I was able to word it (I think it's not really possible to word it precisely, because that would mean wording the ""onness""-experience precisely, which is not possible. Similarly like one can not word the experience of the color of ""red"" to ablind person, becasue it's an **experience**).

Concerning much more controversial ones:
The things that science does not know for the fact yet, I can not know for the fact yet, too. (I'm a scientist, too, but I'm not empirical, I'm a mathematician, so, no gain there ;)). I can be just guessing. Whatever I write next are just personal gut feelings that there might be something more where we didn't find the correct conditions yet to observe it/reproduce it.

* I imagine beaming people and things is possible (though I guess they'll not necessarily turn out to be ""the same person"" afterwards). That is: I imagine transmitting information at infinitely high speed is possible.

* I imagine telepathy is possible if you're emotionally connected enough. I could imagine also that telepathy for beings which are less rational (like animals) is easier than for humans, because they have easier access to their experience and don't filter it as much as us through pattern recognition entailed by language.

&gt; Are there models that can ever well represent reality, such as an equation of gravity?

What do you mean by ""well""?
The reason why we make models is so that they can make predictions. The question of whether a model is good depends on the question of what you want to describe. Newtons mechanics is good enough if you throw an apple at your neighbour and wonder how much it will hurt them. But it's not enough if you want to predict how the photones will behave if you're pulsing them at a double slit.

If you ask whether a ""theory of everything"" is possible - I think no. There are a lot of physicists which say that it's not possible and give very good reasons. However, I never looked deeply into this. 

If you ask whether I believe in determinism - no, I don't. Quantum field theory, I think, suggest that determinism wouldn't work.

&gt; The guy in the video says that many of the greatest thinkers of our time used intuition. However if it is capable of so much good, why is it so often wrong?

I don't think that he said that intuition is the ultimative tool. He's a very rational person himself. I don't think he'd give up rationality for intuition. However, intuition is and will always be a very important scientific tool. Intuition can be wrong, sure. That just means our current mental models are not good enough for this specific purpose.

I'm not sure I understand your question correctly, though. Can you please reformulate it? What does bother you about what he said about intuition exactly?

&gt; You talked about how IYO, the scientific community is often surprisingly conservative and slow. Can you A. Give an example of this in recent years, and B. Explain why is bad for academia to be slow to accept something that just came about?

A. Just two things:

* quick googling gave me this: http://www.mdedge.com/currentpsychiatry/article/96715/practice-management/10-recent-paradigm-shifts-neurobiology-and
They write there that it's already known that what was thought was a reason for depression actually isn't. And that some substances lead immediately to relief and the sucess stays for very long periods of time. However, we continue to give anti-depressants to depressed people who as a result suffer from secondary effects and are dependent on taking the medicine daily.

* I don't know about scientific adjustment to this news, but many scientists who do not work in precisely this field still assume we as humans and some other primates are the only ones who pass the self-recognition test in the mirror. Recent studies have shown that even ants can do that: http://www.journalofscience.net/File_Folder/521-532(jos).pdf

B. Lets say we have models M1 and M2. M2 predicts the same things as M1, but even more acurately or just additionally more things. We clearly should work with M2. If M2 is not accepted immediately, then M1 has to be adjusted accordingly. This process adds unnecessary exceptions and extra explanations to M1, all of which can be avoided by using M2 (Occam's razor). Moreover, obsolete beliefs (from M1) are being speard as ""truths"" throughout the society (I admit, this is a more general problem. However, it's still ""worse"" to believe that we are living on a turtle than to believe that we are living in the center of the universe).

Moreover, it's not inherently bad to not accept M2, it's just that the personal views of scientists often interfere with science on a subconscious level and this can lead to people holding on to beliefs which make other people suffer (such as the belief that dark skinned people are less intelligent than fair skinned people).

I don't think that science should accept everything. But there might be a model T and a model M, where T describes A more accurately and B not so much and M describes A not so good but B quite sufficiently. There might not exists a model which includes both T and M, because parts of their assumptions are contradictory. Then I think it's okay to have the two of them, they enrich each other. No need to throw out either of the window.


&gt; If all things require some level of faith or ""assumption"", how can one talk that they themselves are real.

One can't. Then on the other hand there is the fact that you do experience things and you can't deny that. This is the only thing you need no assumption for. The thing about what is real and what is not - it's a philosophical question."
55,ejyf0pi,"&gt;They want the US to be more white again because that reduces the effects of distrust between groups since then there wouldn't be enough racial division to have disunity on the basis of race anyway.

This is why I say we have an ignorance-of-history problem. ""White"" isn't a group, it's a racial identifier. In the late 19th and early 20th century, you had all different types of melanin-free people coming from all over the world to America. Guess what? They didn't get along. They didn't unify as ""whites"". Italians, Germans, Poles, Irish; most settled around people of similar origins and maintained their native culture in some way; whether their language, their food, something. 

The coalescing of these different groups a couple generations later around the idea that a white society is better, cleaner, easier to live with; that idea is not borne out of a sense of camaraderie with each other. That idea is borne out of a disdain for those who are different. It's easier to literally *see* the difference between a German-American and an African-American than it is a German-American and a Polish-American. I believe that even if the U.S. were 100% white, there would still be plenty of bullshit for people to hate and kill each other over.

&gt; Where you disagree is how to deal with this problem. Your method seems to be to say, ""Hey white people fuck you get over it this isn't your country anymore"".

That is not at all what I said. As I just mentioned above, the problem is, far and wide, ignorance of history. Much like you can lead a horse to water but cannot force it to drink, there is no way to correct someone's misconceptions or false information if they are not willing. That responsibility falls to the individual, and as I said in my original post, people are far too willing to accept what they've heard or been told, take it as fact, and not look back. No external force can fix that -- there's gotta be a desire to learn. I understand my griping to you sounded like me telling white people to fuck off, but it's really more me venting about the complacency in accepting one-sided stories and faulty information around history and race.

&gt;White people are ""losing their minds"" as you say because the current state of race relations is a threat to them and their families. Why would they want the country to be less white if that means fracturing society more?

I don't understand the sentence here. What about the current state of race relations are a threat to white people? Like, what's happening here in 2019 that is such a radical move by minorities that people feel threatened? Is there some weird minority-led takeover of the country that I'm missing?

&gt; How do we achieve that state in which race doesn't matter?

Acknowledge that race is a social construct, one exploited by 18th century Europeans to create a society in which dark-skinned people are a labor force, and the wealthy (and obligatorily, the light-skinned) reaped the benefits. Acknowledge that race is a poison that has lingered in our country, and that we, everyone alive today, are guilty of allowing it to remain relevant. Acknowledge the brutality visited upon people, both domestically and abroad, in the name of the United States. We'd have to atone for our country's sins, but *that* is something many people are unwilling to do, as it interferes with their national pride. People also take it as an indictment upon themselves personally, even though these are the sins of their forefathers. All that is s just for everyone breathing today. 

Going forward, we'd need to explain to children from the time they're old enough to understand (so, like 5) that race is a make-believe categorical tool used to separate and divide people. That people will continue to reference and utilize it when it suits their agenda, but that's wrong and counterproductive to human progress to do so. To create this kind of shift in of our national culture would require a large concerted effort by people everywhere. 

We are all human. The idea that melanin has been so effective in separating us is incredible. I'm sure the fact that I'm mixed is part of the reason for my disillusionment, and I understand the response to what seems like my charge against white people. But collectively, over generations of shaping the country, this is where we are. If we want to move forward as a nation, we need to openly accept all the bad shit that we, *as one nation*, have done to members *of* the nation. That bad shit largely revolves around race, and it's disingenuous to pretend like ""oh that's just in the past."" But like I said, that seems to be a pill that, at least when and where I grew up, people couldn't swallow."
56,e7g7mo3,"My uncle criticized my little cousins (his daughter) cheerleading squad at her high schools home coming game. He said they had bad coordination and sucked. A huge ruckus erupted around him in the bleachers because other people accused him of being sexist and hating women. Needless to say, he was removed by security and the school is deciding whether he can ever attend events again because of “hate speech”. His daughters are being questioned by the schools investigation board about if they’re physically or verbally abused at home. All because he criticize the cheerleading team....

How the fuck does this story relate to a video game? Lots of fans who criticized Odyssey about a woman mercenary in Greece were deemed sexist. Fans who criticized why so many dark skinned people are in Odyssey were called racist. Ubisoft takes pride in being historically accurate. They have mini-documentaries detailing how meticulous they are with the details when recreating an ancient time period. Questions or criticisms like those are valid.

But society today is extremely reactionary. If you say cats stink, you *must* hate animals. If you think the latest Ghost Busters or Oceans 8 was a bad movie, you *must* hate women. If you’re unwilling to romance other males with Alexios, you *must* hate gay people. That’s it. Court of public opinion says you couldn’t have had any other thoughts except misogyny, prejudice, or hate.

57,fbx6dmn,"Why do you call yourselves minorities? Whites are a minority globally. I think dark skinned people are just jealous whites built all of western civilization and every mostly African or Mexican country is a backwater shithole, plagued with disease, violence, slavery and sexual assault."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_racism

I suppose you might argue that it's just poor people who get it in the ass and proportionally dark skinned people are poorer but either way it looks kinda racist."
59,fup1lbe,"Personal experience suggests to me that Thais are among the least racist people around. They are quite nationalistic, however, and can be quite xenophobic (fear/hatred of foreigners, people of different cultures, etc). I imagine that if asked, most Thais could rattle off how people from other nearby countries rank in comparison to Thais. I've known a few who offered such up in any case. And Thais also have that thing going on about dark skin vs light... Dark skinned people are farm workers, while light skinned people are more likely to be Bangkok wannabe HiSo types. It's also the case that only LoSo country bumpkins drive pickup trucks. ""Normal people"" (city people?) drive rot yon. So there are clearly multiple levels of discrimination that go on here.

At the same time, I've not seen anything that even begins to approach the kinds of racism encountered in the states, nor even in Europe. In fact, the only overt ***racism*** I've encountered here has come from both white and black Americans.

Xenophobia, while perhaps distasteful, is more understandable. Consider Chinese people traveling from China. Owing to government, largely, but for other reasons as well, the people of China proper can be ""a bit different"" (refer to various newspaper stories). My guess is that a good many people in a good many countries from around the world may look at them askance. Which isn't to say anything bad about the Chinese people at all. I have Chinese friends, etc.

Much more important just now, however, and completely unmentioned in the story, is the matter of Covid-19. That virus has been allowed to run amuck in Trump's USA, and Boris Johnson's UK is almost as bad, with other European countries hot on their heels. I don't want to see the virus ramp up here at all, and so fine by me if Thailand takes a good, long time to allow folks from those countries to visit again. (I dunno... Maybe that makes me a xenophobic American here in Thailand?)

I doubt that the average Thai person is a particularly gifted thinker (whether in government or elsewhere), just as the average American tends not to be terribly gifted in that area either (consider Trump). ""Average"" is average, after all. And so I can easily understand how ""fear of the virus"" could become fear of the foreigner (regardless of skin color, etc), and how many people just wouldn't think their way through the matter of ""who is most likely to have the virus"" (hint: at present, it's the Thai people, here in Thailand).  That is, I can understand why the average thinker here might discriminate indiscriminately. 

As for temples that charge foreigners admission, it seems clear to me that such places are more tourist traps than temples, and so I do not visit them: they're not ***temples.*** Besides, I don't really need to pay $35US (\~1,200 Baht?) for a 30 minute ""Thai Combo Massage"" at Wat Po, much less $50US for 30 minutes of ""Therapeutic massage""  ( [https://www.watpothaispa.com/#pgPrices](https://www.watpothaispa.com/#pgPrices) \-- Note prices listed in US dollars). Nothing says ""tourist trap"" more loudly. 

And nor do I typically patronize any businesses that engage in dual pricing, nor high priced restaurants that have also carved out 10% service fees and 7% VATs for their largely foreigner (largely tourist) crowds. I just go to ***Thai*** restaurants where they don't do that. National parks are in a separate category, in my thinking. While I do not like the dual pricing there either, I have been known to pay it.

Regardless, I can understand why Thais might want to ""maximize profits on tourists"" as ***a completely separate matter from either racism or xenophobia***. 

I maintain that the Thai people are among the least racist anywhere in the world, regardless of whatever other faults they may or may not have. No racism I've seen here even remotely compares to the kind of racism so common in the states (for example)."
60,fotr2g5,"I have literally never heard the slogan “treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity” before. Where does it come from?

I am a white anti racist. I’m not fussed about whites becoming a minority and I know “white genocide” isn’t a real thing (beyond two or three insane people prejudiced against white folks and a whole lot of paranoid white people) as culture *always* changes and light skinned people (like dark skinned people) are here to stay- even if somehow, terribly, contrary to all reason and goodness, all people lighter than a paper bag were wiped off the face of the planet, new light-skinned children would be born and eventually there would be pink people with blonde hair again. One would have to destroy all humans to stamp out particular skin colours. Does that follow?

Also, why is it anti-white to acknowledge that as a group, whites in the West have it better than people who aren’t white? Do you think that the many studies that show things like resumes that have “white” names and/or photos of white applicants attached get significantly more calls back than identical resumes with “black” names and/or photos of black applicants  are mistaken? 

Please don’t get me wrong, I don’t think that saying that whites are privileged or that we live in a racist system is an excuse to treat anyone with hatred or injustice. Antiracists by and large are trying to make the world better, not worse. Although I will admit, some definitely seem to be shoving their own issues down by focusing on hating other people in the name of a good cause. I’m guessing you’ve seen this, on the left and the right. Does that sound totally off?"
61,f1tw868,"That would be a good way to create a massive amount of resentment &amp; hatred among the two groups of people, similar to the racism which has existed throughout human history. You could make the scenario that dark skinned people are considerably less susceptible to skin cancer than light skinned people. For that reason the dark skinned people would be allowed by the theoretical government to have multiple children + they would receive a higher level of support. Whilst the light skinned people would only be allowed one child per couple &amp; they would receive less support. 


Unless this future race of people has arrived at a point where they are willing to accept these restrictions &amp; make sacrifices entirely for what they consider the greater good for the unborn future generations, you can see where this is going."

This curse was to signify that dark skinned people are born to be subservient to white people. 

Christianity as a vehicle for white supremacy is not new. This country needs to have a real reckoning with itself and it's history."

64,eawop73,"I really love Jackie Aina for this. she's such a trailblazer for the POC community and I will always respect for for doing so. And as someone who lives in a country where lightening products and skin bleach is the norm, I am so glad that someone is using their platform to call out how harmful it is.

&amp;#x200B;

What's so infuriating is that there are STILL people who are attacking her for this, saying that skin lightening is the same as white people wanting to tan. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like, since when is lightening your skin with a product that is literally bleach that cause cause permanent damage to your skin and even skin cancer the same as a white person using a harmless fake tan that fades away in a few days?

&amp;#x200B;

Since when do you see white people being forced to tan because they are constantly being made fun of for being fair and are the butt of every joke for being fair and literally have little to no representation in the media and being told by friends and family that they are ugly for being fair and that they should tan? Never. But that's exactly what happens to people in Asia and Africa, except, they're being treated that way because they're dark-skinned.

&amp;#x200B;

White people wanting to tan will never be the same as Asians and Africans wanting to bleach their skin. Physical damage aside, one is literally just a pigment that people wear cosmetically, while the other is a result of years of colorism, bullying, social pressure, and self hatred that to this day we're still not past.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Light skinned people aren't being told they're ugly for not being tan, but dark skinned people are being told that they're ugly for not being fair.

&amp;#x200B;

I have such strong feelings about this because, again, I come from a country where this is the norm. And despite being considered ""fair"" for where I live (I'm an NC30), I know I will never truly understand how hard it is to be dark or even medium-skinned in a colorist society- But after seeing my friends, my sister, and people I care about constantly being told they're gross or ugly for being dark, after seeing their agony and insecurity over their beautifully tanned and bronzed skin because society tells them they're not beautiful, using my privilege to talk about it is the best I can do, so I don't have to see any of my loved ones look in the mirror and wish they were fairer.  So i'm really grateful that Jackie is doing this, because i'm just a nobody, and my voice will rarely ever reach my entire community. But people like her do, and it spreads like wildfire. I really hope that one day she, and other medium and dark skinned POC, will inspire other YouTubers in Asia and Africa to use their platform to promote the same message they do, that dark skin is beautiful.

&amp;#x200B;

Sigh, I wish there were more Filipino YouTubers and celebrities that have a large reach that promote this message too. God knows we need them. But sadly, we're still very colorist. "
65,ebeb4vw,"While I do agree with you that race needs to overall be brought up less in general, there are just a lot of deep routed hatred that goes on behind closed doors within the black community that others really do not see.

In regards to “black excellence” a lot of black people are under the impression that they will not make it far just because of things we have internalized. I see on this thread all the time people saying that genetically black people are less intelligent than every other race. It is discouraging. So when someone does get their college degree it’s like “yes I am black and I did it!” That doesn’t throw away the opportunities that are thrown at black people today but there are just a lot of things black people have internalized about their success and making it far

As far as “black love” a lot of black people choose to date outside of their race PURELY for the fact that they don’t want their offspring to look like them. They want to get rid of their black features. Lighter skin and looser curl patterns have always been more desired in the black community. In movies it’s always the dark skinned black man chasing after the light skinned woman and the dark skinned black woman so foolishly chasing after the black man. So when there are two dark skinned black people who are in love it’s like wow two dark skinned people are actually in love with each other.

I don’t really do these things but I understand why other black people do it and I won’t call them divisive for it"
66,e2mtggw,"Wow, and I thought I knew alot about ancient civilizations and their myths.. you've done a lot of reading I assume? Lol. That's good. It's saddening to see how many people around where I live, who wouldn't have a clue what we are talking about.

Ah yes, Christopher Waltz. I had forgotten his name but that is who I was referring too. He did a great job of making you like a despicable character. And just the way he played the character.. it was complex.. his method of interrogation.. his ability to go from ""harmlessly  goofy"" to ""deadly serious"" in one moment.  Brad Pitt had some great moments too.. darkly humorous. I think the whole cast was good. The girl who owned the cinema(her name escapes me at the moment) was excellent, and the character they called ""the bear Jew"" was crazy in a good way. Even the actor who played the fuhrer did so in a blackly comedic way.. bumbling, childish, and prone to temper tantrums(which probably wasn't far from the truth) 
I had heard that there was an old black and white version of this movie, but MUCH more tame of course. I have never seen it though. I doubt I would enjoy it the way I did this one because a lot relied on the chaotic violence and dark humor which they couldn't have gotten away with back in the 1950s.
I'm with you on the 'turn the other cheek' nonsense. They used to repeat that all the time in Catholic grade school. I remember thinking ""if someone strikes me, I'm not turning any cheeks, I'm putting my foot up their ass!"" Ha ha!

I didn't know what to expect when I first saw what Ghost looked like. I knew absolutely nothing about them and the brief description I saw just said 'swedish metal band' I could've researched further, and I eventually did, but I just wanted to hear the music. Needless to say, it was definitely not anything I expected and it didn't sound quite like anything I had heard before. It didn't take long for me to get addicted to their sound as well as their presentation.
I never fully understood the Scooby Doo comparison. I assume they mean the campy humor they sometimes have? Like in videos, live shows etc. Or maybe the fact that they wear costumes and masks? But it has never seemed as blatantly vaudevillian as say, Alice Cooper. (Not knocking Alice, just never got into his solo stuff.
 The Alice Cooper Band had some interesting stuff, in my opinion, but overall , not my taste.)
But Alice gets his head cut off on stage, and gets put in a straight jacket, and gets chased by a Frankenstein-like monster... Lol.. I mean, c'mon .. Ghost was never like THAT, and I'm sure never will be.

Yes! When. 'rockstar' came out here,it was advertised as a serious film. Lmao! I think when he made the statement about hip hop it may have just been Mark Wahlberg talking shit while the credits rolled. Can't remember, but either way, the movie sucked beyond words, and NOW they describe it as a 'comedy' in the description on cable TV. Zakk Wylde mustve needed extra beer money... Haha..  ikr! Are the writers familiar with the world of rock music at all?? the fake documentary""this is spinal tap"" seemed more believable, and it was SUPPOSED to be a comedy.

You know a great deal about the deities of the ancient world! I forgot about Pan. Yes. I believe that's what a Satyr was said to look like? 
I had done a bunch of reading about Babylonia, Persia, and Sumeria, the cuneiform language, and the different gods. Especially the so-called sky-gods(Sumerian?), the Annunaki. (I do remember Tiamat, but I think the depiction I saw was a five headed dragon? And I thought isn't that  the same as the Hydra from Greek myth?) But when David Icke and the conspiracy crowd started talking about the Annunaki being giant lizard people who made mankind with their super genetic technology, I just thought 'oh boy, here we go...'. Haha..  but you know a lot more than I do, it seems.. I will have to look for what you mean in 300... Cool link.. I like that image of Pan.  There's so many God's and goddess's throughout history and all over the world, that it gets a bit confusing after a while. 

You're right, the Catholic Church dogma seems to be a mashup of myths they stole from various belief systems they dubbed as 'pagan'.. (I even remember a comparison of Jesus to Sun Worship) and then, to make matters worse, they depict these other characters in disgusting ways to defame/blasphemize them..  so very 'christian' of them, right? And as far as the crowds of homophobic Christian's.. yes I've heard of that psychological problem of 'self-hatred' .. besides, isnt 'hating' something supposed to be one of their big sins? I'm heterosexual, but I never had a problem with anyone else's sexual preference. In fact, years ago when I first met my gf, one of  her best friends was a gay guy and he was totally normal in every way. I don't know what I expected.. glitter and showtunes maybe? Haha.. but we became friends.. now he lives out in California but stays in touch with us online. The media plays a big part in racism and homophobia etc.. although they will never admit it. They pretend like they are against it, while perpetuating it. 

 And of course, the orange pumpkin revels in that old 1940s mentality of ""all dark skinned people are dangerous and can't be trusted, homosexuals are going to hell, and women should stay home, barefoot and pregnant, cooking dinner for their husband"".. what a world.. and I thought by 2018 we'd be taking recreational trips to the moon! Guess I was an over imaginative kid. :-p

Oh and as far as WW3 being started by the Pathetic One, you can take a little comfort in this: 
My aunt used to be in the Navy and was privy to info that others may never hear. One of these was that there are several anonymous people that have to have their fingerprint biometrically scanned before the warheads will become active. Like I said, these people are anonymous, no one knows who they are and they aren't allowed to talk about it. The biometric scanner they use can even tell the difference between living tissue and dead in the extreme case that someone would cut off someone's finger to try to activate the arsenal.

Like I said, what a world.. lol.. :-p"
67,dnt5kwx,"Area bias. When you grow up around certain people, you're more exposed to and affected by their beliefs. If someone is negatively affected by those beliefs and lives in a household where someone is racist and constantly complains about ""brown people"" despite their life not being affected by them substantially, people will start to sympathize with the object of the racist's opposition. It's why liberals defend Islam but critique Christianity - one is closer to home and the effects of it impact them more. Conservatives see danger as being on a global basis, liberals look for it locally.

Look at how some Christians are anti gay and some even kick their own kids out for being gay. Obviously these kids don't think they should be treated that way. So when all their life they grow up hearing about how bad dark skinned people are, for sure they're going to defend them because their parents talked about gay people the same way, and in that sense they KNOW they're wrong. When people that impact your life directly such as family are always displaying hatred and distrust against anything they oppose (and for many religious people, that's a LOT) and you're a victim of their vitriol, of course they're gonna take the other side even if it does suck more. Sometimes it's about sticking it to the people that are directly hurting you, to the people that pass laws that actually impact your life.

Is it right? I don't think so. But I get it. I'm a conservative and I recognize who is actually the bigger problem."

73,fqy145u,"The answer to a lot of your questions is simply, Whites are a scape goat.

White folks of various ethnicities (There are many different kinds of white folks) have managed to make the most of their situations throughout history and ended up on top.

I think that the typical Anarkiddy or Commie wants to believe everyone is inherently equal. I tend to believe that this is completely false and that you can associate a ""Worth"" to each individual. Clearly it is moral to try and respect everyone however we are lying to ourselves if we said a Russian Soldier in WWII was equivalent to a German Soldier in WWII. They simply are not the same one side managed to achieve more advance tactics and equipment. The other was capable of just putting more equipment and men into service. They are not the same and thus cannot be equal. (I compared Europeans to show that this is inherently true and just not Racism^(TM))

Globally there are less light skinned folks than dark skinned. Yet light skinned people in poverty in light skinned countries often have a high standard of living than that of people in dark skinned countries.

I think that they see this as unfair and clearly this is a result of excluding ""racial minorities"".

Essentially Nationalism is a dirty term because it exclaims the ""We can do it without you"" attitude. It also can be seen as implying that dark skinned people are the problem. However like I said above skin tone should not matter as it is cohesion of culture that is important. Well with Cultural Marxism it is now bad to imply a certain culture is better than another.

Uber leftist want everything to be equitable not equal. This means they will cut down white folks so the field is ""equal"". Everyone must have the same outcome or else it is an unjust system. Really the US if pretty Equal however it is not equitable due to things like free will and the decisions individuals make.

All of what I have said is based on my observations and interactions with the left leaning folks in addition of contemplation of politics since I was in highschool.

There was a meme going around describing how no matter what white people do it's racist. This ""Racism"" is then turned around to justify the short comings of minorities.

White people are a scape goat in the 21st century and Nationalism is a rejection of that by embracing European cultures, traditions, and morals. It literally is seen as ""We can do it ourselves and don't need you."""

Since the SU fall, there wasn't a lot of gov efforts into sustaining their multicultural and multiethnic social structure, add poverty and a sociall mess for 10+ years and you have a lot of hate for anything.

Still, how can I explain this... Cops there are a separate mob. They behave like a mob, and have their own rules, and they fuck people according to that. 

In the US you don't have that mob structure, sure the structure is corrupt and all, but it isn't near as organized as a mob in that sense.  And it has been purposefully turned into the direction it's going. 

Enough seeing how the jails pop is overwhelmingly black, how dark skinned people are targeted in the streets for random stops to see a clear bias in the cops behavior...

I am not saying that russian cops are good, quite the contrary, I think that all cops, everywhere, are inherently bad, because even if they are good, they can't do shit because the bad one will shut them up. 

But the US gave their cops way too much power and they are just another mass control tool."
76,e912ucb,"Let's imagine that you want a better life for people living in poverty. Let's even imagine that you're thinking of a particular individual; Poor but with responsibilities to kids, etc. If you cared for this person and it was clear that the financial decisions that they made were important to the welfare of them and their family, it would be pretty understandable that you'd want them to make sound financial decisions. Let's imagine even that they were your sister and the kids are your blood relatives. You'd hope that this person would do things like not carry a balance on their credit card, not gamble, not smoke etc. Let's imagine now that instead of saving for their kid's college fund, they lease a Mercedes, even though a Hyundai would do perfectly well. And this decision further impoverishes their children. 

This is the origin of the feeling that you are describing. It is frustrating when people you care about make incredibly stupid financial decisions. More frustrating still when they then claim that they cannot get ahead because of the 'system'. 

The only thing separating this scenario from one in which you care that generalized people in poverty often waste money on luxuries is the degree to which you care.

Not everything is racism. Sometimes well-meaning people will come to well-meaning conclusions. We should hope so. 

Anecdote time: I work in a building that may have some of the highest rent in the USA. Right down the street is subsidized housing. The people living in the subsidized housing drive fancier cars on average than my coworkers. This means that either one of two things is going on. 1) People are abusing the subsidized housing rules, depriving people who actually need those subsidies, or 2) people with legitimate need of subsidized housing are making stupid financial decisions, condemning them to be continued financial ruin. The idea that either should not frustrate the people paying the taxes to subsidize either scenario is frankly tone-def. 

You can entirely explain the motivation for the thought your describing with good intentions. But your CMV doesn't do that. Your CMV is predicated on the **assumption** of bad intentions. I suspect that this is related to the fact that people who are poor in the USA tend to be dark skinned and people who pay the most tax are often light skinned. In America right now, light skinned people are associated (on the left) with evil paternalism and dark skinned people are associated with virtue. This is stupid.

77,e26wfmb,"Well, if you want a broad discussion about migration to the UK: go ahead. What angle are we going for here?

It undermines a left liberal idea that all migrants are inherently virtuous? That's a straw man. Of course some of them act like cunts. 

That this undermines the idea that FoM in the EU is good for the UK? Well, Africa isn't in the EU and these are fleeing rather than migrating within a single unified economic block so that doesn't hold.

That there is a problem with migration from outside the EU with people fleeing poverty and/or warfare? Yup I agree with you. This is a bad state of affairs, that is very complicated and a problem for everybody involved. 

So those are the big one I can think off.

78,e0i5t2c,"&gt; And do away with the welfare and support systems?

Wrong assumption. First, immigrants in general are substantially *less* likely to receive welfare benefits than natives. They're more likely to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits compared to natives. This would mean that more immigration on balance wouldn't strain the social welfare system we currently have (although I'd redesign the one we have, which is another matter). We'd have a larger net-tax paying population and a smaller proportion of people getting benefits. 

This whole ""dark skinned people are bloodsuckers"" narrative is complete racist bullshit and you and I both know it's what you're trying to advance. The reason why people in third-world countries are poor isn't that poverty is in their dark-skinned genetics; it's that they happened to have the misfortune of being born in a low-productivity country rather than a high-productivity country like the USA.

80,fxsrfla,"Literally everything western. 

I'm in India and saying words like 'condom' and 'sex' is like saying ""I'm a member of Al-Qaeda.""
 Moreover, India is deeply filled with racism, misogyny, homophobia, sexism, and casteism.
Housewife culture is encouraged here, and women who are independent and are might be in a relationship are looked upon as 'bitches' and boycotted socially. Got
Hanging out with the opposite sex is a very big no no here. Also, in my lovely motherland, India, dark-skinned people are considered as ugly and 'ineligible to get married ever'. By the way, dark-skinned girls have it a lot worse than guys. Racism is deeply rooted in the Indian culture but doesn't come to light. 
We also have this thing called 'caste system' in India. Castes are a sub-group of the Hindu religion which, by the way, is a majority in India. People of lower caste can't touch belongings of the upper caste people. This practice, in fact this system as a whole has allegedly been eradicated, but still in 2020 this system prevails. Recently, a pregnant lower-caste woman was killed because she drank some water from an upper caste well.
This happens in rural areas and undeveloped cities, by the way. And also you can't have an inter-caste or inter-religious(?) marriage. 
All of this, by the way, doesn't mean that the upper-caste have it any better. In India , reservation system is prevalent in competitive exams. To be concise, a lower caste person scoring -5 will be accepted but an upper caste person with 50 points will be rejected. 

Anyway, talking about homosexuality is a taboo in India. People of the LGBTQ+ community are entirely referred to as 'chhakkas' which literally translates to eunuchs. Indians think anyone who is a part of the LGBTQ+ community is a eunuch.

&gt;I am certain that it will take a long time for the complete ban of fair skin products marketing cause the industry is growing rapidly every year.

There is no legal ground to ban these products, unless it is not safe for use.

&gt;Sarukh Khan and other celebrities promote skin whitening products do you think it's morally acceptable and why don't they get any backlash for doing it?

It is their job. Pay them to do morally acceptable stuff, they will do it. You can't say ban antagonist characters from movies because it is not morally acceptable. Ramayana and Mahabharata didn't create better people out of their audiences.  

&gt;I think one of em sharukh khan children has a dusky complexion aswell. 

Yes, but money speaks. Ambani's son was fat as fuck ugly as hell in his teenage. He suddenly transformed to a handsome guy before marriage.

In short, you as a person cannot do anything about this. Lord Sri Krishna was dark skinned (the colour of rain cloud) but we settled down for blue skin. Research shows Jesus Christ was brown skinned with aboriginal features and short haired but he is handsome as fuck with long hair.

Government can do stuff. In some countries in the EU, they have black babies in kids books, black girls as models, black guys in TV advertisements. This would make the coming generation thing dark skinned people are also people. This of course works if the parents don't inject racism in their kids."
83,fw8jc1k,"Wrong again. Racism is White supremacy. And it only exists in White-majority countries. The ""racism in many many places"" that you're talking about is to merely believe that dark-skinned people are ugly. There is no supremacy element involved, unlike in European/NA racism.

Secondly, nearly every country on earth still has people they consider ""low"". In the US, it's the blacks. Japan also has a caste system. The Muslim world also has a caste system. So tribes are considered superior to the others. In Europe, people called serfs were considered the lowest. But since Europe became prosperous (thanks to American aid and colonialism), the differences between the groups mostly vanished.

In India, Muslims and Christians follow a caste system too. Muslims and Christians kill Dalits too. 

So stop bullshitting me about caste system being only among the Hindus.

&gt;the hate hindus are dishing out to muslims at the moment.

You Leftist twat. If I start listing out the riots/bombings/murders etc done by Muslims on Hindus, you'd shut up.

Nearly every riot in India was started by the Muslims. Infact, Muslims organize very well before starting the riot. There are a laaaaarrrge number of anti-Hindu riots that Muslims started. Doesn't sound like an oppressed minority to me.

Muslims have forced Hindus out of villages once they gained numerical majority. This has happened in UP and West Bengal. So don't bullshit me about Muslims being victims.

Muslims have been involved in a laaaarrrge number of terrorist attacks and bombings where innocent people have been killed. And you know what's the worst? The common Muslims support the terrorists. Google 'Yakub Memon funeral'. This terrorist got thousands of people attending his funeral.

84,fxbgvin,"Like what the others say, it is deeply rooted in Asian culture.

We even have a local series where the actress wore blackface because she was supposed to be “poor and ugly”. She got “beautiful” when her skin color changed. Anyway, dark skinned people are not usually shown in Korea’s TV, and Korea is not as diverse as, let’s say, America, so it will take years for something to change. Also, there are hundreds of korean products that promotes you to have fair white skin, and as long as actors and actresses are promoting this and using it, there won’t exactly be any change.

The ""beautiful fair skin"" thing is not inherently anti-black in Asian culture. It's just that paler skin happens to be a mark of beauty Asia (and in Europe, to some extent) because historically, pale-skinned people were the ones who didn't do hard labor and were therefore wealthy. Even so, it's just a feature and it doesn't matter all that much, like how their opinion of your looks is not entirely dependent on whether or not you have double eyelids. Plenty of dark-skinned people are considered beautiful as well. Tan Asians aren't uncommon in the slightest, so unless these people walk around with their nose upturned and think everyone's ugly, this isn't really anti-black.

Disclaimer: I'm speaking about East Asians in particular because I don't know much about Southeast Asians or Indians, but I've heard that this really is an issue there. I'm also sure that sometimes the ""don't be dark-skinned"" really is racially motivated, but in East Asia's case, it's more often regarded as a beauty standard rather than a discriminatory remark."

I chose to speak up and support the above commenter that sweeping statements like ""black is beautiful"" don't in fact help to eliminate racism.  (yes I went there.  It is obvious OP is trying to show how a typical marginalized population that is generally deemed less attractive, has attractive people).  The thing is people should be judged as individuals.

There are also a ton of dark skinned girls and young women who will go out of their way to try and convince you that they're mixed with something non-black. It's really sad.

Ironically, there was a law passed in California that says you can't discriminate against natural black hair like for jobs and stuff. When i had dreadlocks, the only people who had a problem with my hair were black female managers. None of the white employers had a problem, some even complimented it and asked questions about how i maintained it.

It's a sad thing to hate your natural features as if they were a defect. That goes both ways, but at least tanning is natural. Skin Bleaching is just absurd.

99,epheyto,"&gt; I’ve already got a decently light skin tone,  
&gt;  
&gt;However, I’m still always looking for products that will help brighten/lighten my skin further.   
&gt;  
&gt;Being as pale as I can is just what makes *me* feel beautiful. 

Yeah maybe examine this type of thinking. Because it's identical to the one in my country, where women are under crushing pressure from society to be as pale as possible and regularly bleach their skin. Eurocentric beauty standards are extremely pervasive and a lot of the time what we think makes us feel good, only makes us feel good because it conforms to a racist/sexist status quo. For example, me and a lot of women I know wear makeup regularly, and though it makes us feel ""confident"", there is an argument to be made that there's a problem when women feel the need to put time, money and labour into concealing/changing their features just to be confident in their skin. Society rewards us for conforming and we feel ugly and underconfident when we don't conform, so how much is wearing makeup a ""choice that makes me, personally, feel beautiful""? (Of course, you might have a different relationship with makeup, but this is a reality for many women).

I think the same concept applies to skin colour. Colonialism skewed beauty standards everywhere, and dark-skinned people are discriminated in their own countries as well as in the west. Let's be real. We don't talk enough about why every AB brand has a host of brightening products. I grew up wanting to buy lightening creams and have bleached my skin.  There exists an entire system that says caucasian features are the most beautiful, so of course, you've been conditioned to conform to them and value white skin. I'm not saying you're racist; the fact that you're introspecting means you actually care. I'm definitely not saying you should feel guilty for being white/pale. But your wording conveys colorism. If you aren't satisfied with being ""*able* use the lightest shade in most foundation ranges"", if you think white skin is the height of beauty for you, if you're actively trying to lighten your skin despite being white and pale already, then you're (albeit unconsciously) subscribing to and actively contributing to a racist, eurocentric, white supremacist power structure.

I know an argument against this is that brown skin is now seen as attractive and trendy in the US, especially in IG culture. Yes, in the west, tans might be seen as attractive to some but the point is that they are not your skin tone. They are ""exotic"" because they mean you have been somewhere luxurious. And they are temporary. When you tan your skin, it is a fun look that has no bearing on your real skin tone, unlike actual POC. This is why a lot of celebrities and influencers such as Ariana Grande, the Kardashians/Jenners, etc have come under fire recently. ""Blackfishing"" and ""brownface"" are real issues. Dark skin and nonwhite features are only praised on white women because they are seen as fun, temporary fashion statements. While black and brown people are discriminated against for them, both in the west and back home."

Either way I hardcore agree with you.

Is it racist to prefer certain races in dating? It depends on why you prefer one race and dislike another. Is it because you:

* hold a fetishized view of that race and you base your preference on that? As an example: You like Asian women because of the untrue stereotype that all Asian women are submissive and subservient? If so, you're racist.
* you consider your cultures incompatible? Not all members of a race have the same culture, for example a black adoptive child in a white family still has ""white American upbringing"". There's no difference in culture there. If you think so, you're kinda racist.
* you consider all members of said race disgusting/lazy/slovenly/ugly/intellectually inferior? You're an outright racist.
* you generalize/stereotype races by thinking they all look the same and think the same? Ignorant, if not racist.
* you prefer a skin tone, usually a lighter one. There's a major diversity in skin tones across a single race. Did you just generalize an entire race? See above, pretty racist.
* just skin color preference alone can be subconsciously racially motivated/have problematic history. In a lot of Asia for example dark-skinned people are often shamed, mocked and belittled. Colorism has often motivated people to associate negative attributes (lower intelligence, class, beauty and value) to people with dark skin. Usually appreciation decreases the darker their skin gets. It's often also has racist undertones, especially if the bullying is coming from an East Asian towards a South-East Asian person. There's a long history of discrimination towards people of the South-East Asia and skin tone is often dragged into the mix as an excuse for harassment.
* maybe you're unaccustomed to a race, and therefore prefer dating people from the races you're more acquainted with? That's somewhat more understandable.
* you come from a family of white supremacists and you consider racial mixing disgusting? You're a racist.

101,ej6sa2i,"You're acting as though the people who create games aren't the ones writing the lore.

The lore exist in objective reality, waiting for them to uncover it. You can make a ""lore-related reason"" for literally anything.

""No, no, my game isn't racist, it's just that the dark skinned people ARE inferior according to the lore!""

Now, I'm not saying it's that brazen an offense or anything, I'm just saying that ""it's in the lore"" isn't much of an excuse when they're the ones who write the lore.

I stated in a reply to someone else, but:

&gt; I'm not sure I'd say ""inherently"", but the way they're typically used (and are used in this case) is kinda sexist.

&gt;The lady race has to be all traditionally attractive and the dude race has to be all big and burly and manly.

&gt;Heaven forbid we get lithe and pretty bunny boys or big burly cat ladies.

I'm honestly not as bothered by the Gerudo because, while I think they're certainly attractive, particularly in Breath of the Wild, they're actually portrayed as big, muscular and badass, rather than having their entire design revolve around traditional feminine attractiveness.

Granted, I will concede that, examined together with the Gorons, you do get that same dynamic, of the more ""sexy"" female race and the more ""ugly"" male race.

On a final note, though: Neither the lore for FFXII nor the lore for FFXIV excludes the existence of male viera. They even worked up concept art for them back during the development of Heavensward. So it's clearly not something completely outside the realm of consideration for them."
102,ekaajoo,"Most people with common sense don't call an entire race ugly. I think you're interacting with dumbasses too much. There's definitely a lot of negativity in this subject, but not all of it is that blatantly racist. Most sensible people who aren't attracted to dark skinned people would say ""they're generally not my type"" or ""i personally don't find most dark skinned people attractive"". And most people I've met that don't consider dark skinned people their type (which is very few, even online) try to be really respectful about it.

If somebody is calling you straight up lesser or saying ALL dark skinned people are ugly, they're just racist bastards. And assholes. That's it. Most people aren't like that. Even if a lot of people are. And it sucks that there are a lot of people like that, especially like you said for young girls. It really sucks and I can't imagine how it feels to be dismissed by thousands of people just because of your skin tone. It must be really shitty. But most people aren't like that."
103,ehqalb5,"Alright alright, settle down and sit tight. We’ve got a chronic case of special snowflake syndrome over here. It ain’t fresh news actually, but it was The biggest drama of last year, and still ongoing. 

Starting off, her name is Lee Shyuan (normal Chinese name in a Chinese school). But she insists that everyone call her Akiko (cringy Japanese weeb name) the first month into school because “It’s a family nickname, and I think of you guys as my family so I ~~insist that~~allow you guys to use it!”. Apparently she’s also called Claire(cringy English name), Qiu Zi(cringy Chinese name), Miyeon(cringy Korean name), etc.

That should’ve been a red flag already, but meh, whatever, she just has a late edgy name changing phase, so what? She’s a pretty okay person. 

In March she gets this crush on a guy in our class. He’s really dark skinned for a Chinese, plus there’s this thing where traditional Chinese parents from a decade back would encourage you to marry a white man for the money, and never marry a dark skinned person because dark skinned people are slaves and/or poor physical labour workers. But that was an old out of its time saying, so her best friends just made jokes about how she has a thing for dark skinned people. All was good and fun. 

Then she went and confessed in May and was rejected. Not much of a surprise, she had never talked to the guy, never tried to befriend him or get close to him, plus they didn’t have any connection beyond being classmates. She didn’t even confess by herself, she had a best friend confess for her through text because quote, she’s too scared to confess by herself but she still wants to confess. 

Yeah. On top of that she didn’t like him for anything beyond “he’s hot and is a decent person”, so it’s no big deal right? She just likes him because she thinks he’s hot, she doesn’t love him or wants to get into a relationship for anything else. Yeah, no, she went and blurted out all over social media about how she was rejected and she was so sad and depressed. Dating is banned and uncommon in our high school, so it’s no surprise that this blew up beyond her control. Plus, the guy she liked? He was crazy popular. Friends from classes A to P, in other grades, plus everyone in band. 

Now, you’d think that since it was such a shallow crush, that she’d just be a decent person and wallow about for a while, then move on right? Besides. All rejections suck. Everyone has that “why did he reject me?” phase. 

Nope. She went on and on for two months. Then, she started to feign cutting. Nope, I’m not some ignorant bully, she wasn’t actually depressed. She literally told everyone that she was cutting because she was so sad, then on Monday she came in with one singular bandage her wrist. She kept taking it off to show people her cut by the way. Which wasn’t a cut, it was very obviously red pen. No scab, plus too bright red. Plus, two days later it was already mysteriously healed without so much as a blemish. 

Okay, you might think. How do you know that she didn’t actually cut because her family convinced her not to? Even so, she’s entitled to being sad right? 

Yeah the only reason she pressed on about being depressed was to pressure the guy into liking her. Yeah. “I confessed to him, and if I confessed to him then he’s obligated to like me back right? I mean, it’s not like I’m ugly or anything.” 

It got out of hand at this point. Almost the entire grade knew about this. Teachers included. The number of people who knew the guy alone was already a lot, but since Akiko was a decent person outside of this particular drama, she had plenty of gossip girl friends too. Eventually the screenshots of the messages of the rejection from the girl’s point of view got spread around. (Yeah, the girl’s, not the guy’s, he was too good a person to spread gossip and do anyone dirty like this. She just wanted the attention.) Turns out the guy actually turned her down like a gentleman, and even said that he was okay with being friends, but he actually had someone he was interested in already. So he wasn’t leading her on like she lied about later on. 

It’s said that after “The Cutting” the guy messaged her privately again, telling her not to act rashly, and to find someone better than him. 

Things calmed down for the month, then word about who the guy liked got out. It was a senior girl in band, and she did singing as a side too. The senior got a part in an acapella, and actually got to preform on stage. Now, Akiko, being apart of choir but had never been praised for her singing, went to watch the senior, Chloe’s performance. Below stage “half jokingly” she said that “Her singing voice isn’t even that good.” 

Oh that made the guy angry. He messaged her (still privately!) and started calling her out on her bitchiness. Then, like the poor “victim” she is she started telling everyone that he was a fake, that he acted so nice on the outside but he was actually a completely different, heinous person on the inside, and that she should’ve known that he had been leading her on the whole time. 

The bitching went on for another month, then the guy finally had the last straw when she started bitching in the class group chat. He started calling her a motherfucker and crazy bitch, “WHY WON’T YOU COME DEFEND YOURSELF NOW HUH? COME BACK AND REPLY! WHO’S THE FUCKING COWARD NOW?” 

Some people said he went overboard (what?? Really?? You’d be pissed to if it were you.) and some said she got what she deserved. Anyways, she stopped bitching and apparently they made up afterwards. She got a picture of them standing next to each other (not touching or posing tho, he just stood straight and half smiled) on the last day of school. The guy’s friends joked about how much it looked like a funeral picture with how straight and formal he looked in the pic. 

Now, they’re in different classes due to difference in grades. It’s finally over. Well, remember how I said this was still ongoing till now? Yeah, she has a new victim. And she likes him for “how smart and cool” he is this time. Stay tuned. "
104,ec1jvhs,"White dude here, non-issue for me obviously but I'd say dark skinned people are generally objectively seen as uglier than not (with hot muscular black guys being the exception). People are allowed to have preferences and it's okay if society agrees as a whole that some skin tones are more attractive than not. It's weird if people are racist to you but it's okay for people to find you ugly cuz of your skin tone. Honestly, suck it up or you should've chosen better parents. "

106,e5x67rw,"I said ""Buddhism (as a religious tradition) has a very cruel underside"" because the concept of karma, samsara, and dependent origination has a logical conclusion that people suffer because of past actions or current attachments. (Do you want me to link definitions of this?)

So the nature of suffering is that people do things that cause themselves to suffer. Where is the concept of evil? Can ""bad things happen to good people"" in Buddhism? I don't think so. Do you see how this assumption creates a system that ""blames the victim""? 

What do you think of this passage?

&gt;""Then the Buddha spoke to Ananda thus, “This question that you are asking--**it is all on account of a previous existence, in which every one’s mind was not alike and equal.** Therefore, in consequence, the retribution is of a thousand and a myriad separate and different minds.
**Thus the person who in this world is handsome comes from a patient mind, and the ugly comes from amid anger; the needy come from meanness. 
The high and noble comes from prayer and service, and the lowly and base comes from pride.**

I think this one might be my favorite: ""**The person who hinders the bright splendor of the Buddha is born black and thin**; and the one who tastes the food of the fast is born deprived of food. "" According to Buddha's ""Sutra of Causes"" dark skinned people are ""spiritually inferior"" than pale people. I guess it's a good thing I'm a tall, skinny, and pale person.

So pretty, rich, and healthy people are better than ugly, poor, and sickly people because of ""a previous existence."" That's a great way to explain inequality. If it's their own fault, then why help them? They *deserve* it.

We both believe we're right and neither has convinced the other.

Now, I do personally believe *some* of the philosophical assertions of Buddha. We can diminish personal suffering by how we take set-backs and negativity in life.

107,e3q6e8w,"There are Indians who think fair skinned people are beautiful while dark skinned people are ugly. I've seen people say ""make India Aryan again."" So there some Indians who believe in these things but they are not the majority."
108,e3wf78n,"It's because no one's self esteem exists in a vacuum. There's a long, long, *long* history of the alleged beauty of white skin being used as a reason to claim that dark-skinned people are ugly. Dark-skinned people hear this *all the time* -- particularly dark-skinned women -- that the reason they're not beautiful is because their skin is dark. It's the reason that you don't see many dark-skinned models, actresses, singers. Hell, it's even a contributor to why dark-skinned people have harder times just finding *regular* non-entertainment jobs; because the society that's been built up around us has created this false equivalency between ""traditionally attractive"" and neatness and cleanliness. People who fall outside of conventional standards are often seen as dirty and sloppy, regardless of how well they're actually put together. This is true for people who just don't have conventionally attractive features; this is true for plus size people; and it's doubly true for dark-skinned people.

So even if it's not the individual's intention to be racist, saying things that suggest you're (general you, not specific you) beautiful and pure and some kind of exceptional beauty *just because* you have pale white skin contributes to a racist culture."

116,dmd5frc,"Hehe. I agree with what you are saying. And I do hold them to the thought of why the ""cream"" needs reservation. Which is when they pull out the argument - ""Reservation is a social reform, not an economic one. It is required because no matter what job you hold you can still be called out for being lower caste"" ""people still don't have intercaste marriages and people still call other people by foul names."" To that my question is, well how is reservation helping any of that. If despite reservation, people can call you out for being lower caste, reservation is not effective. How is reservation going to help you carry out inter-caste marriage? Are upper caste people supposed to have half a lower caste spouse or are they supposed to spend 6 months a year with a lower caste spouse? Even fat, ugly, short and dark skinned people are called names, should they get reservation, too? Then it just devolves into a mess because they don't have any answer. They start name calling and bring more people like them to name call you. There is no getting through.

Also, I raise the point - you want proportionate representation as a ""social"" reform. However, the only place where reservation has been removed is the Parliament. Why are you guys fighting for reservation in jobs which is an economic reform instead of reservation in Parliament which would be a social reform? - In response, nothing except name calling for not being a backward caste. You can't have a reasonable discussion with them.

See, the cream, especially the OBC is hogging everything and they are not letting the real needy people avail the benefits. They don't want other people to come forward because that would mean more competition for them in the quota. So these guys holler ""reservation"" and attack upper castes to keep brainwashing the actually needy people so they can keep availing the benefits at the expense of the needy.

Though I have noticed something. There is a growing rift between SC/ST and OBC. My plan is to fan that rift as much as we can to first chuck out the people who do not need reservation at all and also to try and convince SC and ST that we need to define the parameters for backward for doing that. It partially works. I have to improve my manipulation skills. Maybe I will get through to more people that way."

https://np.reddit.com/r/DarkBeauties/

This SFW/PG-13 sub is meant to be for dark skinned people to showcase their beauty and feel proud in their skin. I had posted about it earlier in this sub but it didn't get much traction. I welcome OP and other like minded people to join our sub and contribute regularly.

Everyday we see dozens of men and women having light skins outside, on TV and online portrayed as the standards of beauty but very few dark skinned people are held under the same banner. This imprints the subconscious notion amongst many (especially impressionable young kids) that being dark = ugly and unfavorable.The sub is just my small part to break such silly stereotypes and help folks be comfortable and confident in their own skin.

I am not from India but since we featured many Indians on the sub, I thought it would be appropriate to post here to get my Indian friends to feel free to share Indian dark skinned male and female role models which I may not be aware of, you can even share a pic of yourself to show that despite being dark, you feel proud and confident in your own skin :)

Remember, dark is beautiful, Dark is sexy, be proud of your skin :)

To OP : If interested I can add you as a mod on my sub. I don't have time to develop and take care of it myself.

Edit: this was a response to a comment I made earlier here which has some relevant points: 

When you look deeper, the thing is in many societies dark skin itself is seen as something ugly. In an ideal world you would expect everyone to be judged by their character and ""inner beauty"" and not the colour of the skin but people have been saying that to dark skinned people in India and other nations for generations but it hasn't really worked has it?

It is this false notion that dark sin = ugly/poor/whatever notion that must be questioned and challenged. Even small children get bullied by peers and sometimes even by adults who should know better.

On media and online we are continuously bombarded with fair skinned models and actress as being beautiful with very little exposure to dark skinned ones. The very few that are dark skinned frequently get photoshop/lighting/make-up magic treatment to appear fairer. All this leaves the idea ingrained that [dark skinned is undesirable among young children](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkpUyB2xgTM) who then lose confidence in themselves and turn to harmful fairness creams, heavy treatment on hair to not look curled etc. 

Regarding India, I'm not sure about this but my Indian friend once told me that dark skin used to be seen as beautiful in India and was even celebrated but that this had changed with foreign invasions and colonialism. Due to this notion pervading Indian society thousands of good looking Indian actresses, models and people involved in the service industry get discriminated against. When the Indian origin [Nina Davuluri](https://np.reddit.com/r/DarkBeauties/comments/4xwb2y/nina_davaluri_miss_america_2014_indian_origin/) won the Miss America 2014, it was widely reported in the media that she would have [never stood a chance in South Asia](http://www.firstpost.com/living/miss-america-nina-davuluri-too-indian-to-ever-be-miss-india-1111477.html) (happens in many other countries too). The same holds true for even a super model like [Lakshmi Menon](https://np.reddit.com/r/DarkBeauties/comments/4zz4dc/lakshmi_menon_indian/), who herself acknowledged that she never got hired back home in India due to her skin colour. Similar sentiments were echoed by actresses such as [Nandita Das](https://np.reddit.com/r/DarkBeauties/comments/509vxg/nandita_das_2_indian/) who has spoken out against the dark skin colour bias in India and is the face of the ""Dark is Beautiful"" campaign and is exhorting women to 'Stay Unfair, Stay Beautiful'.

Several others have been making such statements in Indian media:

[Can we see beauty beyond colour?](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/beauty/Can-we-see-beauty-beyond-colour/articleshow/47538643.cms)

[Not Fair, Just Lovely: Growing Up as a Dark-Skinned Indian](http://www.india.com/lifestyle/not-fair-just-lovely-growing-up-as-a-dark-skinned-indian-552131/)

The same situation does not exist for white skinned people who already get heavy exposure in media, online, fashion industry etc etc. There is no dearth of role models, take Chive for eg, they have a gallery of minorities every couple months but dozens of white ladies every day. This is why I started my sub /r/DarkBeauties to do my small part to overcome this. 

Skin colour cannot be changed, exercised or trained away. The people on the sub are meant to be role models to aspire too, they didn't sulk away [because of discrimination](https://np.reddit.com/r/DarkBeauties/comments/4ztzgs/anais_mali_2_french_with_chadianpolish_heritage/), many of them had [low self confidence](https://np.reddit.com/r/DarkBeauties/comments/504vfo/herieth_paul_2_tanzanian/) or [self esteem](https://np.reddit.com/r/DarkBeauties/comments/4z0sf3/thandie_newton_zimbaweanenglish_origin/), were bullied, [given no attention](https://np.reddit.com/r/DarkBeauties/comments/4zp2bx/fatima_siad_2_somali_ethiopian_heritage/) and some even thought [they were ugly as a kid](https://np.reddit.com/r/DarkBeauties/comments/513h80/cora_emmanuel_french/). But still they exercised, worked hard, overcame insurmountable odds and [succeeded despite starting at a disadvantage](https://np.reddit.com/r/DarkBeauties/comments/4zdh2e/jordan_dunn_uk_jamiacan_and_syrian_heritage/). Many of them have inspiring bios which you can read in the comments.

Why is it whenever that this is questioned that people bring up inner beauty or all is beautiful etc? Isn't dark skin beautiful? Can't dark skinned people have any confidence in their own looks and feel comfortable in their skin? What should be taught is that one need not feel inferior because of their skin colour, that dark skinned people can be beautiful and must keep their natural skin healhy instead of nuking it with chemicals. This is the only way to change centuries of cultural programming."
120,fz3kccb,"Cool, so you recognize that it's not a police officer's job to kill people for suspicion of crimes.

123,ew2wggt,"Good people don't follow a religion that says dark skinned people are evil. It's literally in their holy book. Also, the whole thing reads like a justification for manifest destiny. ""It's cool to kill and displace the natives, their just sea farring Jews."""
124,ejylmwh,"&gt;  you had all different types of melanin-free people coming from all over the world to America. Guess what? They didn't get along. They didn't unify as ""whites"". Italians, Germans, Poles, Irish; most settled around people of similar origins and maintained their native culture in some way; whether their language, their food, something.

Well no, they were mostly considered white. It is a group as far as groups are applied. Only certain groups weren't seen as ""white"" because there were major ethnic differences that made them more of an other like how southern europeans have a history of being invaded and genetically influenced by darker skinned groups.

But yes, there absolutely were issues with those groups immigrating for similar reasons that exist now. Immigration means change. Many changes are undesirable to the established group while being a necessary evil for the immigrating group. Irish immigrants were particularly hated because of their religion and not because of their race...many americans at the time were already descended from irish indentured servants but they still disliked the irish immigrants because they hated catholicism and the cultural and economic changes which led to ethnic tension the same way certain forms of immigration affects racial tensions now.

&gt; It's easier to literally see the difference between a German-American and an African-American than it is a German-American and a Polish-American. I believe that even if the U.S. were 100% white, there would still be plenty of bullshit for people to hate and kill each other over.

That is of course true. If you look more different it more easily identifies you as different. It isn't really a racial thing though. It is because someone who looks different is more likely to have different allegiances, beliefs, and behaviors. That is the true issue. If we lived in a world in which race could not be used to at all conclude that someone is different from you there wouldn't be a problem at all. But that goes in line with what I was saying, that it unfortunately DOES identify on average someone as being different from you. We know this is a fact just based on all kinds of statistics including the big one...how people vote.

&gt; That responsibility falls to the individual, and as I said in my original post, people are far too willing to accept what they've heard or been told, take it as fact, and not look back..

I just don't agree with your conclusions on this. People dont need to know history and don't base this on history. I know all of this history you are talking about and it is irrelevant. If people had no knowledge of the effects of immigration on racial and ethnic relations in american history it would make no difference. In fact most people think that america is a melting pot and there was never any issue with immigration, that everyone just got along because race didn't matter, not that they think whites just get along with other whites. But again, assuming no knowledge about this piece of history people would still dislike mass demographic, cultural, and economic changes due to unfettered immigration. That is the core issue and it bothers people no matter what happened in the past or what they think of other races.  

&gt; I don't understand the sentence here. What about the current state of race relations are a threat to white people? Like, what's happening here in 2019 that is such a radical move by minorities that people feel threatened? Is there some weird minority-led takeover of the country that I'm missing?

Sorry, I can explain that more. The idea is that some white people feel threatened by the increase of anti white rhetoric the past few years as well as the fact that whites will no longer be a majority in a few decades due to mass immigration. In that event, due to the existence of identitarianism of all groups and the cultural/economic impacts of this influx it will lead to the loss of political, cultural, and economic stability of whites.

&gt; Acknowledge that race is a social construct, one exploited by 18th century Europeans to create a society in which dark-skinned people are a labor force, and the wealthy (and obligatorily, the light-skinned) reaped the benefits. 

If you want to talk about knowing history that isn't what happened. Slavery wasn't at all about race. They were taken as slaves because slavery existed in the world and they were able to buy them and use them for the growing nation. There were also white slaves and most commonly indentured servants, in fact half of the early white settlers were such. The more important factor was actually religion, not race. Fewer whites were slaves because christians couldn't be enslaved by their customs. Notably the first blacks in the US were christian and therefore were not enslaved but actually given land.

Setting that aside, I agree that race is a social construct. It is used to label and identify history and different groups and genetic traits. It is an observation of something that does exist but in a society with all kinds of people it isn't a distinction that needs to be made. Unfortunately we can't just snap our fingers and force people to stop being able to observe these differences.

&gt; Acknowledge the brutality visited upon people, both domestically and abroad, in the name of the United States. We'd have to atone for our country's sins, but that is something many people are unwilling to do, as it interferes with their national pride

I have no national pride and I still don't agree. I can't feel guilty for something I didn't do. Even more important than that, I don't see how it makes sense to hold certain people accountable for that while absolving others of that responsibility and guilt based on race. If you are black and american why do you not share that responsibility as an american? It doesn't make sense. If you are american you are american and you should share the same pride or guilt as every other american. Otherwise you are saying that blacks aren't true americans but they still get all the benefits of american accomplishment without the responsibility for any of the bad things. I disagree with that on multiple levels.

&gt; People also take it as an indictment upon themselves personally, even though these are the sins of their forefathers. All that is s just for everyone breathing today.

Another problem, how do we attribute those sins? Do we just assume every white person in the US is guilty even though the vast majority do not descend from slave owners? Even worse, the average black in america is 25 percent white in large part due to their ancestors having sex with their slave owners. Thus they are descended from slave owners not to mention the fact that thirty percent of freed blacks also owned slaves. Statistically about half of whites descend from immigrants who came after slavery and only about 3 percent of whites even owned slaves back then anyway. So again, who do we put this blame on? The average black person in this country is more likey descended from slave owners than the average white person so how would we even go about fixing race relations by acknowledging those horrors? It only works when you inaccurately just blanket accuse all whites as oppressors because the oppressors were white but that is not logical or just.

&gt; Going forward, we'd need to explain to children from the time they're old enough to understand (so, like 5) that race is a make-believe categorical tool used to separate and divide people.

Yes I absolutely agree. Everyone should be american. I even think people should integrate and have more interracial marriage but you can't force that on people. The problem is now that progressive hate color blindness. They despise it and call you racist for it. These are the people who are also in control of the narrative and that is why we are facing such a massive issue on this front now. Twenty years ago we were so close to everyone getting along and not caring about race and now we have regressed to such a horrible degree because of the racist and identitarian rhetoric of these people thinking they are fighting racism.

In closing I'd just like to say thanks for the response in the manner you gave it. I was not expecting you to have an open mind based on what you said before. I quite enjoyed this discussion as a result. I agree with most of what you said and pretty much just disagree on the effectiveness or minor details. It does give me some hope that maybe there are more normal people who see that we need to stop with the racialization of different group identities in this country than it might seem from looking at twitter and other forums where the far left control the narrative with their racist identity politics. I still worry that we have a tough road ahead of us getting people to come together and share the one american identity rather than scattered ethnic and racial identities that fracture us because people are so ingrained in these things now, but I hope we can overcome it and change the minds of the white identitarians as well as those of every minority group."
125,e8je4cq,"Respect your answer. None of your argument makes sense to counteract mine :/

Polar bears would communicate to us whether we are threatening them or if they see as food etc. If there was a feud between species I'm pretty sure humans would just kill. Though a lot of animals we use for FOOD so they work for us. Remember how dark skinned people were used for work for 400 years? Kind of like that. Light skinned people overall were financially superior, more evolutionised systems and advancements so much so that it's so complex on what you would consider superior anymore so it's basically anyone's judgement. Dark skinned people are on average at the minute financially inferior. Yes it's a difference, but it exists from person to person, unique experiences, arguments and perception.

Light skin's reaction to sun's heat can be considered an inferiority etc etc. Incase you was trying to use racism as a way to fight your argument 'against racism' :/ (talking about milk)

Talking about trucks, racism is as serious as you want to make it. Obviously to humans, I was using animals as an example, but if you want human examples, how about an Australian woman born with light skin though her family are dark skin? Which 'race' do you think she should identify with? "
126,e36qbmr,"Melanin is what determines the color of your skin. More melanin means darker skin. Melanin absorbs UV light. UV light absorbed by melanin is no longer available to potentially cause damage to the cells DNA.

So dark skinned people are genetically predispositioned to being able to handle more UV light. It's like a natural sunblock. But it doesn't remove the risk, it just lessens it. Black people can still get sunburned and can still develop skin cancer it just takes more exposure than a white person.

Releasing melanin is the skin cells natural response to protect itself from UV exposure.

UV light damages cell DNA by disrupting its chemical bonds. A cell can repair this damage, to an extent. If the damage is too severe then the cell will kill itself to prevent spreading it's issues to the rest of the body. This is done through a process called apoptosis. This is a function programmed in the DNA. If that part of the DNA is damaged the cell can't kill itself and that leads to cancer.

Some people believe that by tanning you are protecting yourself from getting cancer. This is wrong. By tanning yourself you are damaging the skin cells to trigger a melanin response. People who are genetically darker don't have to damage their cells to get this color. So there's a difference. When you repeatedly tan you are damaging cells over and over and over. Because it's never enough to kill them the cells can repair but there's always going to be defects. Those defects build over time and increase the likelihood of skin cancer.

There are numerous skin reactions to repeated tanning, skin color being one of them. It also causes the skin thickness to increase, it becomes like leather. It also causes premature skin aging, wrinkles, and using a tanning bed before 35 years old increases your chance of developing skin cancer by 75%.

Once you get a sunburn the damage is already done. There's nothing you can do. The cells are already dead. This will trigger your epidermal stem cells to start dividing again to replace the dead cells. The new cells will push up from below and the dead cell layer will abrade off. Using lotion doesn't fix this, it just soothes discomfort."
127,e0asuup,"LUL, you support LGBT rights but you don't want them in your games.

128,di005sj,"I'm very sorry to hear of your predicament. While I agree with you that everyone has their preferences, I agree that aggregate preferences in the United States likely make dating as a dark skinned person very difficult. The reality is, people benefit from having choice, and the fact that dark skinned people are a minority in the country, and that dark skinned people sometimes reject their own, restricts choice and work against dark skinned people's making healthy choices in the dating realm.

My advice to you, though, is that it's still worth a try. As homosexuality becomes more accepted, the pool of people interested in dark skinned men could increase substantially, because you will have more people that are openly gay (or, at least, openly gay to themselves) that are open to dating dark men in the dating pool. I really do think things will get better as time goes on (even if it's still hard, if things get 40% or 50% better, you'll likely perceive that subjectively as a huge improvement).

Also, dark skinned guys may come up with innovative solutions that make dating better for them. How about a dating app for dark skinned men? Honestly, I think that if an app like scruff added skin color as an option to be filtered on, it would be a good thing. That way, people who are attracted to dark skinned men could find them more directly. I realize that there's an issue with fetishization, but I think the solution to that is to screen for guys that are thoughtful and considerate. The reality is, many people fetishize others to an extent. The key is are they thoughtful anyway, or inconsiderate? And maybe, aside from online solutions, there could be real-life societies of dark-skinned men and allies helping each other in major cities.

Lastly, if all this stuff doesn't work, and you do have to go it alone, I would offer this tip to live as meaningful a life as possible: try to spend your time helping other people. I think the most important thing that people get from being in a relationship is the opportunity to help and care for someone else, because it gives the carer self-esteem and makes them feel valued and important. You can get this outside the context of a romantic relationship. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this wouldn't be a letdown, it'd just be making the best of things. But you'd still have some fun along the way.

Feel free to message me if you want someone to talk to. I'm not dark skinned, but I am mixed race, and I've had a fucking rotten time of dating, so I do think I can empathize. I hope you feel more hopeful soon."

The wealthy in the United States do a fantastic job of keeping the proletariat pointing fingers at one another. They exploit xenophobia and racism to continue a narrative that foreigners or dark skinned people are to blame. All the while pocketing more and more money.

Honestly it blows my mind. Why do people with that much money need more? What drives that insane greed? Is it a rush to know you have that much money? Does it produce some sort of addictive high?

It isn’t just about “racism shouldn’t exist inside fantasy settings” and more about how problematic the trope that “dark = evil” leading to “dark skinned people = evil” is in fiction."
143,fziw8at,Saying not all but most dark skinned people are evil is still racist. You don't have to cancel or hate Tolkien to acknowledge his shortcomings. And he did deliberately try to undo the racism he established in his earlier writings.
144,fzjapmi,"Light skinned humans have a vast variety of people that include the good and the bad, like regular people. On the other hand, the dark skinned people we see are always on the side of evil. Even if Tolkien *said* some dark skinned people are good, he *showed* only the evil. Telling and showing are not equivalent, showing leaves a stronger impression in story telling.

Also bloodlines are extremely important in Tolkien's Legendarium. Some bloodlines are better and more noble because of the blood they have. This is the very old world view that is at the heart of old racism.

I think Tolkien wasn't a bad person. I also think he did deliberatly try to undermine his works' racist undertones e.g. Gimli and Legolas' friendship, Sam's thoughts about Easterlings, saying good dark skinned people were wiped out etc. But these still aren't enough to say his Legendarium hasn't race-y tones or isn't racist at some parts. I think it's more ethnocentric rather than racist. And it makes sense considering Tolkien created his Legendarium as an alternative mythology for Europe.

For example, in a private letter, Tolkien describes orcs as,

&gt;""... squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes: in fact degraded and repulsive versions of the (to Europeans) least lovely Mongol-types.""

Saying ""to Europeans"" shows that he doesn't necessarily agree with the definition. But the fact that he still put this in his stories also shows that he doesn't care enough about the racial biases to not perpetuate them.

I think Tolkien had good intentions, and did try to correct his mistakes later in life. But I also think he was heavily influenced by the biases of his times and this reflected on his writings. And he failed to acknowledge this, at least publicly."
145,fv908n0,"The selective breeding camouflage argument could be an interesting argument, if it actually camouflaged them at all. But it doesn't. They gain no benefit from hiding in dim light or darkness. The drow statblocks in the MM are proficient with Stealth, but they don't have expertise, and playing as a drow doesn't provide any such benefit. It doesn't camoflage them at all, partially because anywhere dark enough for it to do so is too dark for them to be seen anyway. This is the reason real animals which live underground usually don't evolve that sort of camouflage: if its dark enough for black to camouflage you, its too dark to see anything other than a silhouette anyway. Also, they have white hair, so even if it could work, that would ruin the effect anyway.

The reason having the evil-alligned race be dark-skinned and live in a place where dark skin never naturally evolves comes with a bunch of problems is that there is a long history of people (especially Christians in the South during Reconstruction and Mormons up until the 1970s) believing that dark-skinned people are dark because they were cursed for past transgressions. When this was done in the Reconstruction south, it was said in the defense of the continued mistreatment of black Americans.

Honestly, the biggest problem with the depiction of Drow is that WotC tied skin color to culture, so anything about that culture ends up getting put in the context of color. If the only difference between the Drow, Wood Elves, and High elves were culture, and they all had a range of skin tones (as is the case in their other product, MtG), this wouldn't be a problem. But instead, they made the evil ones that live underground black, they made the peaceful forest-dwellers ""copperish"", and they made the ones with ""keen minds and a mastery of magic"" have skin ranging from ""bronze"" to ""alabaster""."

If every left-wing Christian decided to become an atheist overnight, do you think that would cause all the right-wing Christians to drop their bigoted fanaticism? Or would that just give them more ammunition in their argument that they have a monopoly over objective truth?

Hopefully, these tropes are changing, albeit rather slowly."
151,forv09h,"The duality between light and dark, good and evil (or perhaps mischief), and the respective associations with each, has long been a trope present -- decoupled from race -- in world mythology, but most importantly European mythology. For example (most pertinent to Tolkien) depictions of Ragnarok have the sun consumed by Fenrir, or the sun turns black and stars disappear as the earth sinks into the sea. Darkness is at the apex of the apocalypse. This trope is perhaps most evident and recognisable in the medieval conceptions of shining angels, perfect beings of the Heavens (realm of the sun and purity) vs. demons, otherworldly creatures from below (realm of serpents, thorns and fire). This especially Christian conception of duality is encapsulated within Elvish tropes themselves, where most fantasy worlds hold Dark Elves as some sort of Fallen Angel sister-race. I don't deny that real-world racial bias could have influenced these religious depictions, or Tolkien himself, but I think it's more likely the psychology of fear (that is, fear of the dark and unknown) promotes beliefs in primitive peoples that over time evolved into moral systems and religions we know. Nor do I deny that these tropes would promote racial bias throughout history.

The problem we're discussing enters the picture when Tolkien creates the classic essentialised races. To me, it's not that dark-skinned people are evil, but rather that in Western mythos evil would be personified as dark-skinned creatures. Which actually *is* different, though perhaps that's little consolation to PoC in today's climate."
152,fot01rr,"No it doesn’t, this comic just serves to illustrate how inane and pointless it is to attempt to drag real world politics and racial representation into the world of D&amp;D. Everyone has their own head-canon as to how all the races look, behave and act, and how its ultimately all up to interpretation. The problem presented in the comic feels more like a lore miss-understanding that was accused of being racially charged generalization, followed by a bunch of condescending banter directed at the ‘offender’ on how ‘darker skin + inherently evil = clearly intended racism’. If the guy thought drow had pitch black skin because of a series of D&amp;D certified books he read that had dark skinned evil drow, he isn’t wrong in thinking that would be the case in other D&amp;D related material. And it certainly doesn’t make him racist.

If people want to attribute real world racism to a fictional race of people that *could* have darker skin who follow an evil, magical god then that’s their prerogative. I personally don’t like treating D&amp;D as yet another battleground for real world social ideological problems to be fought on, and I certainly don’t like attributing racism in people for having a different mental image of a fictional world’s characters. Drow can have purple, black, brown, grey, white or even translucent skin, because it’s a fictional race in a fictional magical world that can be suited and adapted to fit any narrative or gameplay purpose. 

Drow elves CAN be evil and that’s fine. 
Drow elves CAN have dark skin and that’s fine. 
But combine those two things for any reason and suddenly now you’ve created racist imagery and that’s unacceptable. Because some people in the real world think dark skinned people are evil and you are clearly attempting to emulate that belief in our fictional world with fictional characters that have fictional gods that rule over them.

153,fppcx2q,"So I could be wrong but I think the comment that said only 1.5% owned slaves was pointing out how ridiculous it is that the confederate states went to war over an institution that many of them were not (yet) part of. Like the article you linked said, many soldiers were young and didn’t have the wealth to own slaves but they still fought a war for that institution. They likely had family members with slaves but there was still a significant (poor) part of the confederate population that would never own slaves at all and they still overwhelmingly supported the civil war as a means to preserve slavery. 

The point is why? How did these people who didn’t really benefit all that much economically from slavery get so invested in the institution to the point that they went to war over it?  The answer is of course propaganda from the wealthy class who integrated slavery into the antebellum culture of the south directly in order to protect the institution. They did this because *they* were the ones with an economic interest in slavery and so the slave owning class manipulated the lower classes into supporting slavery as well even though it wasn’t necessarily in the interests of the lower class. 

This reminds me a lot of what happens now with poor republican voters who are manipulated by the wealthy to act against their own interests in a way that protects the wealthy. They are even still using the same tactic of making the lower class think that the interests of the wealthy are somehow part of the common culture or venerable. It goes like this:

The rich are success stories of the American dream, if we don’t protect them we are spiting on the American dream. 
== 
Slavery is part of our storied and noble Antebellum culture, if we attack slavery why you are attacking the south itself. 

The rich worked hard to get where they are. They are dedicated bootstrapers who deserve their money and if you are poor you must be lazy and deserve it too. No handouts!
==
The Bible... eugenics... history... tells us that dark skinned people are inferior to white men there fore white men naturally must be in charge of darker people. No freedom. 

It’s the same shit just with a different flavor. 
I want to clarify that just because I think poor confederates were manipulated into protecting an institution they didn’t really have an interest in protecting I DO NOT think that absolves them in any way. They still fought for slavery and they still committed evil acts in the name of it."

Indeed even at end when both sides go bad the darker skinned people are less evil and more blessed by God than the ""white"" people who are wiped out they're so evil.

160,ev016t2,"I don’t find just calling them “dark” in your work offensive, but you should be conscious of who is calling them that, and the themes and subtext you are creating. The potential problem there could come from them not liking the term, but calling them that in what should be neutral narration or something like that.

Another problem could be unintentional theming, or unfortunate implications, especially if you are basing their culture off real cultures, and especially those with modern day humans practicing them just trying to live their lives as normal people. I would avoid this problem by not adapting real world cultures one for one, and avoiding using real world tropes that are used in real life to denigrate others as your fictional reality. (Ex: Dark skinned people are evil. Dark skin = less evolved) In other words, it’s ok for a character or characters to believe something like that but we as the audience should be able to understand that’s not the case/the reason that is the case."

The author learning all of this crazy spiritual shit from a Swiss farmer

65,000 years ago Atlantis and Mu fell and civilization was destroyed, so some friendly aliens grabbed an ancient hivemind spirit and put it on earth to become a prophet. It was Galileo for a while.

Earth is bad because we have spirits from too many different star systems which have different ages

We're going to move into a current of light from the galactic sun which will make us all spiritual and cause the Age of Aquarius. Things might be awesome or they might suck.

Being born in 1937 makes you extra spiritual and a great leader

A random lady was contacted by the friendly aliens to try and establish a relationship, but she got tossed in a loony bin.

Then a cowboy-obsessed little boy is contacted by the aliens and they reveal that he's the ancient star spirit, and he begins his journey into saving the world or something. He has UFO pictures that are TOTALLY NOT A HOAX.

We're descended from 20-30 foot tall Lyrans with white skin, blond hair, and blue eyes. They conquered the Galaxy a couple of times, but also sometimes got wiped out by comets or by infighting. They conquered Earth and were then intentionally stranded there for war crimes. Some of their leaders used advanced technology to become our modern concept of God.

Oh also genetic engineering happened?

No wait this other dude, Pelegon, is the orgin of the modern concept of God.

They keep repeating how primitive dark-skinned people are. Lovely.

""There are seven basic colors of humanity in the universe: White, brown, red, yellow, blue, green, and black. Six are represented on Earth.""

We sent some evil mad scientists into space. When they came back, they destroyed Atlantis.

No wait, the orgin of the modern God is this dude named Jehovan, ruler of the Aryans.

But Jesus was real- he was a pretty chill guy taught spirituality by the friendly aliens, but modern people are jerks and don't get the message.

If you murdered someone in a past life, you owe them a karmic debt. If they're in need of help, they can subconciously draw on your life-force.

White people aren't superior, but they are an older race descended from titans. So forget all that stuff we said about primitive brown people.

Polyamory is cool, but that doesn't mean we aren't sexist. The criterion for a successful marriage is if it produces pleasure for the male. Children serve the same purpose.

Oh, and the friendly aliens are more highly evolved which makes them whiter.

All medical problems are caused by being illogical.

Sometimes evil aliens come to earth to experiment on us.

The friendly aliens are uber-smart and have awesum sifi tech and it's totally cool man

Alright, I read 150 pages and now it's mostly pseudoscience. If there's anything interesting beyond that, let me know. Have a good one."
165,ed4de34,"Admitting what?

You obviously have dementia.

I know a lot of conservatives who don't deny science and are in fact scientists.

I've known ""progressive""liberals who believe in the flat Earth

What you're doing here is playing identy politics and being an ignorant, prejudicial bigot.

People like you are why the corrupt ""two party"" system are broken. You spend your life fighting evil on ""the other side"" while utilizing that exact same evil and defending those qualities on your own side.

""Trump's only out to help the rich, is owned by the Russians and is a misyoginistic sexist"" All the while Hillary's Clinton foundation funnels millions in donations from Russians, owned by corporations and who's husband was impeached over sexually assaulting a young intern and flying the 'Lolita Express' to pedophile island...

You'll make every excuse as to why Trump's evil and unacceptable but Hillary is a saint.

It's a fucking hypocrisy overload!

But the conservatives are worse because some of them ""deny science?""

Do they truly deny science, or do they disagree with climate change?

I agree that there's climate change. I believe a lot of it is man-made. What I don't agree with is the approach too solving it. But I'm a centrist. I see a lot on the right not denying science, but denying the way the left is pushing it or the way they want to solve it. There's a small percentage of conservatives who are the ""science deniers"" as you call them, but it isn't the whole conservative party, just like not all liberals are antifa thugs who want socialism.

Both parties have their good points and bad, neither are ""worse"" and those who chose a side, ignoring the faults and blaming everything on the other side and making bold, sweeping generalizations that paint everyone with the same brush is just as bad as being racist.

If you make a group of people by taking a sharef trait like say skin color or political affiliation, claim yourself better than them by saying they're bad because you disagree with them, giving them all traits of the worst of them, that puts you on the same level as the KKK and NAZIS.

You're taking traits that may apply to some and applying it to the whole group unfairly and using it as justification to be an asshole.

You ""All conservatives are science deniers"" == 
KKK ""All dark skinned people are criminals"" ==
NAZI ""All Jews are destroying Germany and the world""

Just try to remember that everyone is human, does what they think is best for the world, have their own opinions about what's right and are there heros of their own stories.

Whereas a liberal might think it would be great to solve the world's thirst problem by buying everyone a Coke with money they got by raising taxes. A conservative might think that's going to bankrupt the economy and wants everyone to pick up x amount of trash to get a Coke.

Both want the same thing, they just go about it differently. Of course both get money out of the deal, the liberal by skimming money off the top, the conservative by giving the Cole vendor a deal and getting a kickback.

That's politics in a nutshell. 

"
166,eblzr4g,"Think also, on a deep level, the older Disney films in some ways put in animation a lot of ideology Mormons love to live by: you're a victim for being good, everything around you is evil, nobody understands you, and you (good) will eventually triumph over the bad guys (evil). Most of the films have this kinda theme. This goes right with Mormon persecution complex, much like many of the supposed heroes in Disney films were actually the oppressors (John Smith). This is little different than TBM Mormons thinking they're saints, but actually being the ones to make the world worse.

Also, many of the older Disney films were full of antiquated, prejudiced ideas and as well blatant caricatures of peoples from foreign cultures. Just think about the racism of Peter Pan's portrayal of Native-Americans. In addition, pretty much ALL the old heroes and heroines were as white and blue-eyed as possible, and portrayed against literally dark enemies with accents resembling that of foreigners. Heck, even non-white *allies* in the films were still portrayed as often savage or stupid. This lines up well with Mormon ideas that dark-skinned people are less righteous and dumber than white people.

Further, I've known more than one Mormon girl, and certainly ex-Mormon girls, explain to me that, at least when they were part of that cult, saw finding the right guy and getting married in a temple much like a Disney princess finding her prince and having some lavish, beautiful, white wedding. Here, this goes right with the Mormon ideas about waiting till marriage and marriage being just between men and women (ironic, because of polygamy).

In any case, I could go on and on. Altogether, at least with the older Disney films, TBM Mormons would find little objectionable. Conversely, in my short time as a convert, I remember old TBM Mormon women in particular complaining about the modern Disney films. They would say things like ""Why do they *have* to make her \[Tiana\] black? Why can't they just make a normal character?"" Then I heard many of the older males complaining, saying stuff like ""Why does every female character have to be the leader?"" or ""Why does every female have to be so smart and strong? Women aren't usually like that.""

Not even kidding, though I will say many of the Mormons I dealt with were pretty old and from places like Idaho, which is extra-extra crazy."

171,e0q728u,"I think our culture is too severe on racists. Like /u/ilovechems said, he's probably an overall good guy, but since his parents are racist then they instilled that into him.

In our culture, the first thing we do when someone is racist is to fire them from their job or ostracize them however we can. In reality, if we want to combat racism it's not by having a ""zero tolerance"" policy, but rather it's about opening up a dialogue and challenging their beliefs.  When he says dark skinned people are more aggressive, ask him where he gets that belief from to make him think. Odds are, his parents just instilled it in him so he's not going to have any concrete evidence to point to. If he were to say something like, ""Well just look at jails. It's like 90%+ black people despite the fact that they make up a much smaller amount of our overall population."" At that point, you can make an argument about the environment they were raised in and how if a white person is raised in a bad home and community they would be just as likely to wind up in the same circumstances.

You can point to successful and well-tempered people of color like Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Oprah, or anyone you might know in real life. I grew up in some pretty white suburbs, and I could count the number of black people in my grade on all my fingers. When I think back, two of the black kids could out-nerd any of the other white kids. They were super nerdy, very reserved, and not aggressive or ill-minded at all. Examples like that can help challenge those viewpoints.

If overall he's a good dude, then I wouldn't just cut ties with him. I don't think that helps shed light on the subject for him or help cure the racism. I also don't think he's racist because he's evil. I think he was raised that way so he adopted those concepts. If he's otherwise a good dude, then challenge him on it and try to open his mind. It sucks to lose a friend just because of something that was more or less outside of their control. That's like me not being friends with my best friend because he's a Christian. Well, he was raised to be a Christian by his parents who believe strongly in religion, so naturally he falls in line with that and it's difficult to challenge. Outside of that belief, we align 100% on practically everything else.

While being racist is certainly worse than being a Christian, I just used that example to illustrate that it was more or less outside of his control and he's probably not a bad dude."
172,duhu3ar,"Haven’t gotten to do much in it, but I was inspired over the summer and have broad (very broad for some) strokes for most of my setting. 

#The World of Leyphus

Leyphus has three continents; Otror, Aemar, and Oceanus. 

Starting from the north of Otror:  
    
- The Iron Cities: Vaguely Nordic/Viking Elves sung the Iron Cities out of the earth itself. Over time they’ve all developed into various forms of elected governance, though with the lengths of terms that doesn’t matter for anyone but the elves (not that non-Elves can vote, they lack “long term perspective”. There are 15 city states that make up the Iron Cities with the rest of the world considering it’s overall capital to be Fejernhjem. On the southern border of the Iron Cities the Elves sung Firth s great Iron Curtain to keep the hordes and tribes of the Infinite Steppe our. Interesting quirk: I moved Drow up from underground to the farthest northern reaches where their skin magically changes from black to ice whites based on the season. 

- The Infinite Steppe: a great temperate grassland where two competing factions vie for supremacy. The Tonkawa Confederacy is a confederacy of 11 Plains Indians Halfling tribes, bands, clans, and nations led by the Tonkawa Nation who hail from the western side of the Steppe. In the East is the Glittergold Khaganate, a set of Mongol Gnomes who have been unified by the Whindleblitz Khan. 

- The Midbari Caliphate: protected from the Steppe hordes by the Dread Waste the Midbari Caliphate is Fantasy Arabia (and Egypt). Made up of 4 sultanates joined together under the Caliph Mazeed al-Qasim. Interesting quirk: The Caliphate has a vampire problem as a cabal of Vampires have infiltrated as Viziers across the Caliphate and are attempting to summon Haset, an evil god who was banished long ago. They are opposed by the Anubit, a secret society of Were-Jackals. 

- The Qomoran Remnants: South of the Midbari Desert lies the Qomoran Remnants. A millennium ago a great empire arose in the tropical region, based in its home of Qomor the Qomoran Empire spread across the land. 573 years ago an Incident occurred which affected everyone in the Empire’s core provinces except the Arcane Spellcasters (so naturally they were blamed). As the newly established Church of the Heavenly Message took hold in Qomor and the Empire lost its hold over the region new nations formed, collectively they are referred to as the Qomoran Remnants. This is my Europe analogue with each nation being a fantasy European nation. Interesting quirks: due to the Incident and the rise of the Church of the Heavenly  Message Arcane magic is illegal in the nations that surround the old imperial core of Qomor. Also, as a quirk of geography and The Qomoran Remnants being the primary human population center, White people dont really exist in Leyphus, as there aren’t human populations (outside small groups in the Iron Cities) living in temperate regions where light skin would’ve developed. 

- The Siuan Sea: Serving as a Mediterranean analogue(north of Qomor, west of Midbar) the Siuan Sea is said to have once been a great forest but the Storm God grew angry at the people so She and He flooded their home. The people fled to the treetops and when the rains stopped after a generation they found that He and She had turned their forest into a sea and their treetops into islands. The Siuan Sea is Asian Atlantis. The people here are organized in extended family clans that live on the sea in Zhu Chuán or “Home Ships”.  Interesting quirk: the Storm God is referred to by alternating use of both male and female pronouns. He and She were angry so She and He flooded the land. This brought a smile to His and Her lips. 

- Hudarra: at the southern tip of Otror, behind the Hudarran Range lies the nation of Hudarra. Styled after the Roman republic with a rigid three caste system (Praetans at the top, followed by Aquatans, and then the Nepazan) Hudarra is populated almost entirely by Tieflings and Aasimar. Interesting Quirk: intra-racial marriage and coupling is taboo in Hudarra, children take after the lineage of their opposite gender parent so a Tiefling mother would have Tiefling sons and Aasimar daughters. Because magic. 

Oceanus is the middle continent, consisting of hundreds of islands in the Ocean separating Otror and Aemar. The northern half of these islands take inspiration from the islands of the Pacific, while the southern islands are inspired by the Caribbean. with the center being a blend of the two. 

In Aemar to the West; 
   
- The Dragonpeaks: atop these peaks live the Dragonborn with each color having established their own clan/stats under the guidance of a proper dragon. These clans are loosely organized into chromatic and metallic factions. 

- The Hidden Kingdom of the Mist People: Much of Aemar is covered in a thick jungle, this is the home of the Mist People. While few have travelled into their home these dark skinned people are said to hail from an incredibly advanced kingdom hidden deep in the jungle. It’s Wakanda. It’s Wakanda, but magic. 

- The Ipelan Marshes; these swamps, marshes, jungles, and wetlands are home to the amphibian and reptilian races. Tortles, Bullywugs, Grungs, Lizardfolk, and the like have carved out lives in these moist regions. "
173,drjptz6,"I disagree with your view on multiculturalism.

174,dn590gx,"I guess this is is part of maturing in the gospel (regardless of your age or when you were baptized). It's inevitable that anyone who is intellectually curious will find this kind of stuff out. But then there are questions to ask and decisions to make. 

Now that you know, do you believe that this was intentionally misleading or part of an overarching conspiracy? Or is the church simply made of well-meaning, fallible people with a human tendency to romanticize history that speaks in their favor? Is the gospel still true, even with those human flaws? Also, how does the Church react when those inconsistencies are brought to light? Are the principles and ordinances of the gospel worth more to you than our frail understanding of history?

I think it's encouraging how the church has reacted in recent years. They have been through enough scandals about church history to have faith that the truth will be revealed eventually. A good example of this is the ""salamander letter"", which seemed credible, until it wasn't. I appreciated that the church has put a lot of effort into publishing essays on difficult church topics as well as the Joseph Smith papers. 

The longer I've been in the church, the more I appreciate that we keep receiving revelation. General conference talks change according to our needs. You no longer hear about rock music being evil, or that the only solution for a happy family is for the wife to stay at home, or that dark skinned people are cursed. All that remains consistent then and now is the gospel of Jesus Christ. I appreciate that manuals and teaching methods are perpetually updated, and we have more resources than ever before. "
175,di8faqm,This is accurate in reverse. Tolkien's fantasy world is about the civilized races and the savages. All the dark skinned people are evil. All evil humans are dark skinned.

178,fybx4uk,"The entire idea that 'dark skinned people' are committing more crimes is a lie left over from the Republican 'Sothern Strategy' which was intentionally designed to use racist (and I never use the word racist for anything other than someone in power or control over some institution) ideology to gain votes in the south.

&gt;In American politics, the **Southern strategy** was a [Republican Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)) electoral strategy to increase political support among white voters in the [South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States) by appealing to [racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States) against African Americans.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Republican politicians such as presidential candidate [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon) and Senator [Barry Goldwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Goldwater) developed strategies that successfully contributed to the political realignment of many white, conservative voters in the South who had traditionally supported the Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party.

It's not just an leftist idea that this was a thing. It was a real strategy that the Republicans have since apologized for.

And it wasn't just like they used dog whistles, or anything.  Ask one of Nixon's senior staffers, [John Erlichman](https://www.drugpolicy.org/press-release/2016/03/top-adviser-richard-nixon-admitted-war-drugs-was-policy-tool-go-after-anti). The entire point of the Drug War was to allow the government to get away with wasting resources bothering black people and leftists even though everyone was using drugs, whites far more than blacks.

Even if you don't believe any of that, before you even looked at the inaccurate crime stats and determined blacks committed more crime you'd have to wonder why the Nixon Administration launched the Drug War 6 months after creating the EPA. You would also have to ask yourself how is it possible that the Nixon Administration is privy to information that suggests drugs and black people using them causes crime when the Nixon Administration was definitely aware that crime rates were rising world-wide, everywhere on Earth, and definitely not just in black neighborhoods.

Black people being responsible for more crime is the biggest lie of the 20th century."
179,g0bcpig,"Most people have an aversion to eugenics for one reason or another, but it is mostly borne out of ignorance.  For example, the Nazis believed in eugenics, so therefore it must be bad!

Eugenics is nothing new.  It goes back thousands of years, and almost everyone agrees with it on some level.  If you believe people with Down syndrome shouldn't be encouraged to procreate, congrats... you believe in eugenics.

Do you think society should reward people for being attractive, athletic, intelligent, or charismatic?  Then you believe they should be granted the resources to afford procreation.  Congratulations.  You are now in the business of choosing who can &amp; can't afford to breed.

Eugenics is relatively commonplace.  Peasants might not believe it to be true in the same sense that horses &amp; cows might not believe it to be true, but I can assure you that it is indeed commonplace in one form or another.

I know fuck-all about eugenics, so you'll have to excuse me if my terminology is inaccurate, but to me, a distinction should be drawn in between selective breeding &amp; genetic engineering.

Both of these sorts of eugenics could be beneficial or harmful.  When it comes to genetic engineering, I'd say anything beyond dabbling with animals (preferably ones that don't procreate a lot, are less likely to escape, and can be more easily recaptured in the event of an escape... y'know... like not fucking mice) in a highly controlled environment is irresponsible.  We just don't have enough experience with that sorta stuff, and the consequences of these sorts of things can be exceptionally high.  Do I think the scientific community agrees with me?  Absolutely not.  The scientific community is full of worthless arrogant douchebags.  There are probably hundreds of teams of scientists out there who are currently dabbling with human DNA or dabbling with animal DNA &amp; then releasing those animals info the wild or being very careless about their containment.

When it comes to selective breeding, even that is done very carelessly.  It is politically incorrect to say it, but we are currently engaged inappropriate selective breeding experiments.  There are probably tens of hundreds of millions of people out there who believe it's a great idea to mix all of the races together because somehow, magically, some sort of master race will result.  (After all, it works relatively well at the self-serve soda station, so why wouldn't it work in all cases.)  At the very least, it will tackle the largely make-believe specter of racism, so it must be good.

In reality, it doesn't appear that way.  The laws of our existence are largely immutable.  Dark-skinned people are made to be near the equator, and light-skinned people are made to be more near the poles.  Even our individual bodies know this, and they adjust our melanin content in response to significant exposure to the Sun.  Anything other than acceptance of these facts is to be at war against nature.

What are the consequences of this war against nature?  Well, for starters, the consequences are relatively irreversible, and inappropriate Vitamin D levels would be another.  Anything linked to Vitamin D, you could directly translate into having an effect upon dark-skinned people in polar regions and perhaps light-skinned people in equatorial regions.  I'm currently of the impression that the major side effects of being too light-skinned in equatorial regions are mostly immediate &amp; obvious (skin burns &amp; some link to increased rates of skin cancer,) and the consequences of being too dark-skinned in polar regions are more unknown.  Obviously, Vitamin D deficiency is one factor, but there may be others.  Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to bone loss, hair loss, fatigue, depression, susceptibility to illnesses, etc.  Vitamin D is also heavily involved in gene expression... that is, the ability of DNA to properly manifest itself.

In short, humans are stupid.  Even the brightest amongst us."

182,e74mq2p,"&gt;And a great way to get people to care/change it is by making white people effected by it.

I agree with that point: empathy is necessary to bring about change. My point was just that whenever you say white terrorists should be locked up there, it is important to highlight the extreme suffering of the innocent Muslims in US torture camps who are locked up due to a failing Empire (I'm not even going to say a failing foreign policy because the rise of white supremacy under a first US black President and the subsequent election of this guy shows the US is failing). As a Muslim, we don't want anyone locked up in such a condition. To say that is more powerful than saying a white terrorist should be locked up there. The latter somehow legitimises the use of torture which should always be illegal.

&gt;Just look at gun violence in america. Nobody bats an eye at inner city violence that happens en mass, like when several students (including a school bus) were gunned down at a bus stop, because theyre just ""ghetto kids"" and its gang related.

That's the entire history of race relations in America. I [recall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Asx0bZID40) Malcolm X saying they were Africans. Because if they were Americans they wouldn't be catching hell. Or something similar to that. Understanding that dark skinned people are still second class citizens in the grand scheme of things is vital in understanding the problem. I would argue it stems from America's white superiority complex in thinking they saved the world from Nazism and Japan. As opposed to them realising their own ideology inspired Nazi Germany. Obama would have been the perfect pro-war politician for the Republicans; his economic policies were anything but Socialist. His only problem that Republicans didn't like was his skin colour. And so they lied about his politics and said he was a Communist.

&gt;But as soon as a white school in a nice neighborhood gets shot up, they're calling to ban guns and all kinds of shit

Preach.

&gt;So if we want to get rid of torture prisons, start sending innocent white people to em and violating their rights. That shit will change *real* quick.

Not so fast. If the history of Islam/monotheism throughout all the prophets has taught me one thing, it is that through extreme suffering and trials, the believers have always been successful by staying righteous and steadfast. To torture anyone is a grave sin. And so to suggest that one will be liberated by a sin is only a treacherous thought from the devil. Rather if you turn away from the teachings God has given you, he himself will humiliate you and replace you with a people who will follow his teachings and will worship him. Even if they sin more than you and your generation, they will seek forgiveness more than you and your generation. It is for this reason in Islam we are encouraged to seek sincere forgiveness even over the smallest sins and pray often. If we stop praying, we will be replaced by a generation that will pray more than us and sin more than us and that will be better in the eyes of God because that generation would be fulfilling their fundamental purpose in life (worship). From this, we are encouraged to stay on the right path even if we are suffering under a brutal tyrant. To transgress against the limits of God in an attempt to uplift our own suffering (eg. harming innocents) is to say you are just as bad as the one oppressing you.

To point out the double standard is one thing. Refer to what I said about de-legitimising peoples' suffering."
183,e2fhmrr,"Well I am not saying this is okay but slavery is common in Cote D'Ivoire where a lot of chocolate comes from. So slavery helps people get affordable chocolate. But in reality economic slavery is really not any better than this. There may be people who are forced off their land and onto plantations by economic policies implemented in their countries. 

I think the typical situation of slavery for native Americans for example was that they would have a tribal war for whatever reason and one tribe would end up mostly wiped out. They would be absorbed into the victorious tribe, and after a couple generations they would intermarry and you wouldn't really be able to tell who was a slave and who wasn't any more. 

  This is a big difference than a system where only dark skinned people are slaves and are not allowed to marry light skinned people. "
184,dwjkixw,"Racism is literally all in the mind. If the Nazi s had won the 2nd world war, they planned to breed out brown eyed Germans (yes, really). Brown eyed Europeans would have been regarded as inferior in the same way as dark skinned people are regarded as inferior by many whites. But does eye colour matter?Does skin colour, eye shape, nose shape, hair colour matter? I note that personality and intelligence are at least partly inherited. As such there may be slight genetic  differences in intelligence and personality between races but these differences are quite clearly very minor. All homo sapiens are still very closely related.

186,djynx9o,"As a Thai, that's about as eurocentric a viewpoint as possible.  I'll tell you upfront that it's difficult to find any Asian culture that doesn't discriminate on skin-tone, and that dates to pre-modern times.

Different populations of people can be readily recognized by their physical characteristics, and skin tone is the easiest to recognize as a distance.

Since I'm familiar with Thai discrimination, I can tell you that Chinese-descended merchants are readily picked out from the native Thai populace, and their generally lighter-skin is one of the key features.  It goes without saying that foreign merchants were discriminated against in a variety of ways.

Similarly, dark-skinned Thais are also discriminated against, seen as being uncultured, rude, and unintelligent.  My father considers it beneath him to even engage them in conversation except strictly in terms of ""business"" if he's buying something from them from a food cart or some such.  Thais from the southern part of the country tend to significantly darker, and can be recognized from other features - looking more Malaysian.  In addition, there's a pretty good chance they're Muslim, and basically  everyone dislikes Muslims as there's essentially been a low-key religious war ongoing for the past few centuries in southern Thailand, so you get to mix racism and religious tension.  

There's also discrimination against the Hill Tribes, but it's not really skin-tone based because their skin tone doesn't different that much from the dominant central Thais, but they're very visibly different looking from normal Thais and are basically also viewed the way you might view some weird tribe from National Geographic, because that's where you get the weird practices like the neck rings to lengthen the neck for beauty.  They didn't really have much contact with ""civilization"" until modern times when railroads were carved through malaria-ridden jungle and mountains into said ""hill country"", so even today, they're distinctively non-Thai culturally.

On top of that, there's the normal skin-tone based classism extant almost everywhere, where dark-skinned people are of course low-class laborers who work in the sun all day.

And of course, that's just for the people who actually live in Thailand, there's of course also dislike of a broad variety of foreigners, especially Chinese and Burmese historically, and more recently Chinese and Russian tourists, for basically the same reason Chinese and Russian tourists are disliked everywhere."

The racism claim is definitely bogus in my book, though.  He called another player “blackie” which in South America is categorically not a racist nickname, lots of dark skinned people are called this by friends.  Obviously to non-Spanish speaking Europeans it sounds atrocious but it was a cultural difference, not a racist slur.

194,f76oi4i,"&gt; I used it with my webcam and saw it detect my own face.

You were probably using a pre-trained haar classifier or something. In the scenario the GP made up - engineers inventing a new facial recognition algorithm - the engineers aren't going to be sitting there playing around with OpenCV's batteries-included algorithm. That's not how making a new classifier works; you run it over a large dataset, not just the small team of engineers working on the thing.

&gt; people firing up the demo app and not seeing their face detected on the web cam feed would get that issue worked on more

*Maybe* having more black engineers would result in the engineers noticing detector failure modes, but probably not. These things are tested, not by just trying it out on some random engineers, but by training on a subset of (labeled) data and testing on another subset. What is almost certainly the case is that the extremely dark-skinned people are such a small fraction of the population (even of the black population, here in the US) that changing the model parameters to work better on them would have decreased its performance for the majority of users. In the end, whoever trains and deploys the algorithm has to decide what constitutes an acceptable failure rate, and those failure modes might be concentrated on input data with atypical characteristics (like an extremely narrow tone distribution). Having more black people working on the model probably won't change that.

You could argue that most companies are too lax with their acceptable failure rates - in fact, I agree with that."
195,ev1n88d,"&gt; Alien bodies though, eh, it's a body. For the purpose of compelling and mature science fiction, that's not such a huge factor / you can only describe a body so much.

I guess it depends on what you mean by ""bodies"". If you're assuming that the aliens in question are effectively identical to us, you'd still have a range of issues to play with. For instance, in Four Ways to Forgiveness (for simplicity I'll be using all Le Guin works here) the society revolves around a caste system based on skin colour, rather like the antebellum South, but with the colours reversed (i.e., the pale-skinned people are chattel slaves, the dark-skinned people are the masters). Beyond that, another plot point involves an off-world visitor who gets caught up in what is essentially a slave rebellion failing to stay under the radar because his eyes are different than those of the local people. 

Once you allow for differences in physiology, the possibilities become basically endless. In The Left Hand of Darkness, all the people of the planet where it takes place are androgynous, only becoming male or female during their monthly fertile period, the social implications of which are more fully explored in the short story Coming of Age in Karhide. In The Matter of Seggri, there are far more women than men (it's implied that this is due to some kind of chromosomal abnormality leading to few viable male babies being born), and this imbalance is used to explore the idea of a matriarchal society. 

In (not so) short, alien physical form can absolutely be used to create good science fiction. Le Guin was a master at this, but others have done it successfully as well."
196,el5aesi,"it's called Colorism. 

it has its roots in colonial/antebellum society where lighter complexioned black slaves received preferential treatment for various reasons (in some cases the lighter slaves were actually the children of the plantation owner and would receive better treatment due to that).  All were still slaves, but there was a social caste system inside of the slave groups largely based upon skin color. 

Fast forward into post-slavery America, and parts of that hierarchy still continued to exist. Black colleges, prominent black sororities and fraternities, and other community institutions still enforced Colorism - with some even having a paper bag rule (if you're darker than a brown paper bag, you can't join/enter). These ideas are still upheld in parts of black society today.

Dark skinned people are not treated as inferior in India unlike America. In India, You are not denied jobs and prevented from reaching positions of power because of dark skin. You are not suspected as criminals by police and constant victims of brutality because of your dark skin.

216,ekgtbom,"There seems to be several problems discussed besides the inaccuracy of the current facial recognition software. 

&gt;“There needs to be a choice,” said Buolamwini, a graduate student and researcher at MIT’s Media Lab. “Right now, what’s happening is these technologies are being deployed widely without oversight, oftentimes covertly, so that by the time we wake up, it’s almost too late.”

This has little to do with how accurate it is and more about where it is used and how it clashes with the right to privacy of the public. Does it have to be 100% correct to have positive outcome? Is it fine at 90% as well if it still helps to either catch wanted criminals that otherwise would escape authorities or does a fairly good job at helping companies profile their customers to better advertise for individuals? What about 80%? At which point does it become a political issue and what point it's just strictly a technological limitation?

&gt;A Buolamwini-led study published just over a year ago found disparities in how facial-analysis systems built by IBM, Microsoft and the Chinese company Face Plus Plus classified people by gender. Darker-skinned women were the most misclassified group, with error rates of up to 34.7%. By contrast, the maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males was less than 1%.

I don't know exactly where the software is used but having just 63.7% error rare out of only dark skinned women that are idk, less than 20% of the population means it's still fairly useful depending on the application. It's not too different than the ""cameras are racist because dark skinned people are more difficult to photograph"" debate. For those not aware it was a thing.

221,dn3p833,"&gt;You're still grouping a whole race of people together based on the colour of their skin?

So if I say I am not attracted to gingers what am I then? A ginger-racist? 

I see skin colour no different to any other physical trait. Just like I dont like red and bright blonde hair on men or them being obese I dont like them having very dark skin. It is my personal preference. 

Some people think my skin is too white and prefer more tan/dark skinned people. Are they racist? No, they have a different taste than I do.

&gt; Everyone is an individual person and looks different?

Yes and this difference is brough by different visual traits. A person can look entirely different with 2 different hair colours. If there were 2 identical twins and 1 of them was fat while the other wasnt they would look different. Skin colour influences appearance the same way. 2 identical people will look differently with different skin colour. Thats just how it is.

&gt; Demonizing darker skin/african traits as less attractive is more likely to be caused by outside factors rather than 'personal opinion'

Or having different taste in people? Like prefering dark eyes/blonde hair/lean body. 

&gt;If you fell in love with someone who was black, would you not what to be with them because of it?

I most likely wouldnt fall in love with a black person because  I dont feel attracted to them. Just like I dont feel attracted to obese or too thin, blonde and ginger people. Its my personal taste in men. At the same time I find a lot of asian people hot. Am I now racist only against black people? Just because I dont feel attracted to them?

&gt;Even if I, as a mixed race person, said that I won't date white people it still sounds bad ?

If you said you wont date white people because you prefer dark skin aesthetically it doesnt sound bad, no. If you say you wont date while people because all white people are racist nazis it does sound bad.

You people need to stop making everything about race. Saying that people arent allowed to not find certain races attractive is racist itself because you are implying that those races are different and their visual traits should be treated differently than visual traits of other people.

No, we all are people and we all are attracted to different things. Its all about the reasoning on why you dont like this trait.

Saying ""I dont like short guys because I like to feel small"" is ok. To say ""I dont like short guys because they are all rapists"" is not ok because its not your preference anymore, its prejudice.

Just like saying ""I prefer pale skin"" is ok, but saying ""I only date white people because all black people are criminals"" is bad. 

Idk, its an easy concept, people.

Not everything is racist."

2. Legal immigrants are great
3. Islamists are a threat that should be treated as such 

Good work, there are the 3 points continuously levied by Trump since he announced his campaign and you will **never** find him explicitly or even implicitly saying anything worse than that. See, the difference between his voters and you is his voters actually watched his speeches, and all you did was watch and read people who get paid to lie about what he said at rallies and then you believed it because you'd rather that your feel-good hallucinations continued than have to confront the depth of your own ignorance.

228,fwaegrd,"No, you’re right 100%. I didn’t take your comment in an aggressive tone or anything, and I apologize if I got carried away in mine. There’s tons of discrimination issues, and yes the core product remains unchanged and it does suck a lot. And ya, I’m not gonna speak for ALL of these countries, but generally, within my experience of India, dark skinned people are indeed considered “uglier” than a light skinned person. But to answer your question of why maybe the US takes more flak, while there are protests in India over these issues, the West is often looked to as the standard which means there’s always a sense of pressure to be perfect in every way, and it’s surprising when it’s not. Also, the West has a MUCH larger protests and takes more flak simply due to how much larger of a social presence they have, especially online which leads to things getting magnified intensely. Just my 2 cents, would love to hear your response"

Especially in American culture where people are expected to be cheerful all the damn time. Can you practice with him on looking more open/friendly when talking to people? I used to have RBF but then figured out how to develop a kind of resting smize that I use with difficult people.

The race issue is definitely going to exacerbate things: some people get really defensive around minorities, and unfortunately dark-skinned people are often stereotyped as ""angry"" or ""aggressive"" instead of ""shy"". If he's of a different cultural background there might be a clash of values there as well. Is there an ethnic organization for his field where he can talk to mentors of his ethnicity?

Usually, darker skinned Latin Americans in countries with a largely light-skinned population do face a large amount of racism. My dad is from the Dominican Republic where darker skinned Dominicans and Haitians are treated so bad by the government and common people for things that happened 200 years. I know in some Central American countries, dark-skinned people are subject to daily racial and ethnic discrimination. Racism is a problem everywhere, just because people are more culturally vigilant some place doesn't mean that the US is ""that obsessed with race"". 

The original post was about how black winners are often discredited and I do agree to a certain extent. I think a lot of people haven't seen Season 1 so they don't know what Bebe could do (and she is FIERCE). People often say ""oh Tyra was an asshole"", but if you watch that season, Tyra was moreso petty and immature rather than an asshole. Raven was a FUCKING CUNT through and through. She truly said some disgusting things yet the fanbase eats her white ass up because she has good makeup. While Tyra isn't the best person, she SLAYED that season and deserved to win over Raven, who was messy from start and ended nicely. With Bob, I know there wasn't a lot of backlash within the sub, but in the general social media, people went OFF. Coming for his race and how him being black was the reason why he won, his makeup skills (and alluding that he has had makeup when it isn't really that bad), saying he's too confident and ""showboats"", even though that's what you would do when you want to win $100,000. It's so fucking stupid. Shea didn't win (she should've but Ru wanted to change the format), but even throughout the season people tried to discredit her and said ""oh well she's slaying the game but no one can connect with her so Trinity is going to win"" and ""Shea came off as so aggressive in the reunion and that's why I don't like her"". First off, Trinity wasn't going to win. She's a great drag queen and really talented, but she wasn't versatile enough and simply wasn't ready. Shea came in and slayed from the moment she walked in. Anyway, there is always some discrediting with black winners and it does play into a subconscious idea that black people aren't good enough, even when they are the best. "
233,djysbz3,"It happens to black people, by other black people. There's a big debate in the ""black community"" between ""dark skinned"" and ""light skinned"" people. Dark skinned people are sterotyped to be more aggressive, more straight forward, less emotional, cooler etc and Light skinned people are the opposite. They're sterotyped to be emotional, soft, effectionate, feminine, etc."
234,dionmds,"I dont know what two para means, but if you mean that you don't like the source then here is the [original article by reuters.](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-australia-refugees-idUSKBN18J0GA) 

As for the rest, we can debate over this all day if you want, but the fact is that the president made a statement that it was occurring and there are articles stating that it has started. In the second article:

&gt; Manar Waheed, the legislative and advocacy counsel at the ACLU, called the **new questionnaire** “extremely problematic” and said it could be used to “profile and discriminate” against visa applicants.

This confirms that there is at least a new questionnaire. 

As for the 'discrimination', all immigration vetting is 'discrimination' based on certain qualities. Obviously discrimination based on uncontrollable qualities like sex or race should not happen; I think that any non-radical american would agree with this. But to 'discriminate' based on ideology, values, education, skills, or the like have been going on for all of time, and to increase the specificity of this 'discrimination' is neither illegal nor is it unethical. Rather, it is necessary. It would be inappropriate to allow someone into this country who believed that dark skinned people are meant to be slaves. The Immigration Act of 1924 specifically limits the amount of immigration from each nation; this is obviously 'discrimination' based on nationality yet it is a law of our country. As far as I can tell from research, though I could be wrong, there is not even any law prohibiting the discrimination of immigrants based on any quality including race or sex or age. Obviously its wrong, but I just want to point out that as a nation we reserve the right to 'discriminate' immigrants based on whatever qualities we deem necessary. 

Furthermore, the ACLU is not a government entity, nor is it impartial. The ACLU has specific agendas, such as open immigration, so any comment from them should be taken with a grain of salt given that extreme vetting is on the opposite end of the spectrum from open immigration. 

I agree that the 3rd article does not really provide any further evidence, but there is this statement: 

&gt; State Department consular officers have stepped up questioning of visa applicants and are vetting social media activity. Homeland Security officials have increasingly used their removal and detention authority, employed more aggressive screenings at airports and have stepped up searches of travelers’ laptops and smartphones, according to immigration experts.

In any case, I think that there is enough evidence to be reasonably suspicious that changes are occurring in our immigration policy to make it more strict. Trump also campaigned on extreme vetting for many months, it was one of his major promises. Even if you dont think that its occurring yet, it would be silly to think that it wont ever occur. "

Of course, when you’re done being a child and are ready to start being an adult, part of this is understanding that now you’re one of those same strangers on the street, as is everyone you grew up with and most people you know.

Fear is a very useful tool for childhood development, but the end of that development is understanding the rationality behind those fears and treating them rationally moving forward.

The people (MSM orgs) who continue to drum up these irrational fears in others - the fears that lawful gun owners will commit violence, that dark-skinned people are less civilized, that all immigrants aren’t compatible with established societies - are the agents of this recent sociological shift in Western communities. They intend to cripple us with fear so that we will roll over to oppression.

I’ve been dealing with personal anxiety recently, and I never understood how to handle it until I realized how strong of a weapon it is for others to use against me.  I never realized how hard it would be do disarm these agents, even though I’m already holding their weapon in my hands. "

242,eannoxh,"Here's the five minute version of what  will eventually see in your 9th Grade Biology textbook:

1. Within populations, individuals vary along certain traits. Some people are shorter, some are taller. Some moths are lighter, some are darker. Some bacteria can metabolize citrate without oxygen, some cannot.
2. At least some of this variation is heritable from parents to offspring. The children of tall people will likely be taller than the children of short people.
3. Sometimes, individuals with a certain trait have an easier time surviving and reproducing in a certain environment than individuals without that trait. For example, in a forest where all the trees have light bark, lighter moths will have an easier time blending in and avoiding predators. In a forest where the bark is all dark, the darker moths would have an advantage instead.
4. Given 2 and 3, if a trait is advantageous, more organisms with that trait will survive and reproduce, and the frequency of that trait within the population will increase in the next generation.
5. If the trait is advantageous enough, for a long enough period of time, then after many generations every organism in the population will have that trait. If there's so little sun that most dark-skinned people are vitamin D deficient, the population is going to get lighter. If there's so much sun that most  light-skinned people are getting skin cancer, the population is going to stay dark.
6. If this happens over and over again over a long period of time, you can end up with a [population of creatures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale) that look very different from [their ancestors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulocetus).

This is the result of simple rules applied over and over again for very long periods of time. It's a completely natural process. There's no need for a ""guiding mind"" anywhere in this process, any more than you need a guiding mind for a rock to roll downhill.


This is a gross oversimplification, of course. It doesn't cover what mutations are, or how inheritance works, or what genetic drift is, or how speciation occurs, or what sexual selection is. But if you're genuinely interested, I'd be happy to explain those, too."

And then he had more authentic dishes for his Chinese customers, and we'd apparently ordered the one for white people. They can't help it because white customers often spend a lot and they try to please these guys because it brings the money in. But the lady who served you might legitimately be a huge racist, it's true that a lot of Chinese are racist to black and brown people. There's this deep rooted disdain for dark skin that makes ignorant people believe that dark skin is ""unclean"" or inferior and that dark skinned people are unclean and bad people. It's ridiculous especially when you try to explain it because you can't explain racism - racism is illogical. Though personally I feel like New Zealand is actually one of the less racist countries, especially in Auckland where there  is a lot of immigration. I've only had a few instances of racism directed at me, and I try never to be racist though I do acknowledge that there's a rather significant cultural divide between myself and Pakeha people. "

Throwaway account because some of my friends know my main account.

We were discussing about dating and romantic love stuff on a group chat, when my friend asked, ""what kind of trait that you look for in a partner?"" Now, I honestly thought that her question includes *physical* traits and I replied with ""I think dark-skinned people are sexy"". Welp, another person in the group chat became so livid and furious. She said that it's disgusting for me to ""fetishizing"" skin colour like that and that I should know better especially the chaos happening in the US right now (We live in an Asian country).

Apparently, the friend who asked the question clarified that she meant traits as in abstract ones, not physical. And now the person who was enraged accused me for being racist and narrow-minded because I only see appearances. I tried to explain to her that I meant no offense at all and I am sorry if it's offending but I honestly never thought of races when talking about love interests. She just said ""I don't want to hear excuses of a racist"". To add into my defense, dark-skinned people aren't necessarily limited to African-American individuals. I mean, dark-skinned Asians exist for crying out loud and I have dated one of them, and he wasn't offended at all when I use ""sexy"" as a compliment.

To make things clear for you guys, I can definitely tell that I am not a blatant racist person as the person accused me to be, however I read some articles on the web and I can definitely understand on how calling people ""sexy"" especially POCs, is degrading and derogatory to them and implicit bias and racism does exist. I think I want to explain and make things clear myself again in the group, but then again I thought it would just make things worse.

Therefore my fellow redditors, am I the asshole for making a deragotary comment on POCs or was she just being overly critical?

251,f27zs8u,"Like other porn scenes-it will definitely happen, just a lot more rare than how casual porn sites make out scenarios to be. The irony of living a fantasy is exactly that. Paradoxical. The woman/women who get off to these type of vids specifically-probably fantasize about this stuff because they feel a huge lack of attraction towards them and so they like to think having multiple people finding wanting them sexually makes them feel what they think they're missing out on; and so it's usually low-class or least attractive females who are in this demographic. I think this (theory) lines up with why it's usually the low-class (least standards for mating/relationships) females who match up with dark skin males especially (it's not that uncommon in England imo). I think reasons why dark skin males have the gang banging stigma and around low-class women is that they in the past we're economically low class too, where the most known &amp; wealthiest dark skinned people where usually artists, like musicians, so that (association with them being cool, like-able and inspirational) came from there (along with the society's natural instinct pity for lower-classes) and that coupled with dark skinned penis girth &amp; length being apparently larger on average means lower-class women (who have their vaginas treated more carelessly (by themselves) or roughly (by others) because of lesser standards, made looser, baggier, more unhygienic etc) means they prefer wanting to be filled more and so the thought/rumor is enough to start that fantasy for them, and if they actually get it to happen (like this, with multiple people) then the males probably will treat her low-class (because we treat females higher class the more standards they have, especially standards of monogamy), this scenario specifically-has a really young seeming girl which adds more layers-such as mainly a sign of lessening the protective standards Caucasians in society on average have of their offspring (making them seem weaker, the dark skinned people stronger, more cunning etc-outsmarting them/defying those standards, if not just the ones we have of protecting against 'under-age' sex, laws etc) You could also say that because all the males adults are dark skinned and that because the girl is young and youth is associated with deviancy, brute honesty and doing what they want without expecting repercussions - it could be said (because of her seeming willingness for the obviously foreboding sexual act) that-that furthers the significance of dark skinned males being more supreme esp' in acts of sex in comparison to other, and because of my above points the dark skin pity etc the media seem to love to hammer that idea in their media and have for the past 8 years. Which is why it annoys me, because not only is it cringey and I do film but it's just a never-ending shitload of statements in film and media nowadays about how dark-skinned people are the best protagonists etc even though (not co-incidentally that they usually act the worst even when playing the protagonist) that's been a fantasy because every country knows the reality is that dark skinned people are usually most likely to commit crimes etc, take drugs, be lazy etc, not turn up for work, promote polygamy, have bad hygiene, and be most obnoxious, but i guess that's trying to be changed and of course not case for all, I'm talking in comparison to other, but media I guarantee will continue to shove this shit down your throat. I just saw an advert for a film/serious documentary about dark-skinned people being killed first in older films.

252,ef71wfi,"Most atheists, and Muslims too actually, don't find the idea that crazy in my experience. Dr House jokes aside, a virgin birth is far more plausible than an entirely fabricated dna sequence which is half...spiritual...whatever that means. We can make virgin births happen today with science. We will never be able to use science to make beings of light hybrid with dna.

Enoch is a book for me which is good because it seems to tell each story twice, from more than one perspective. A great example of this which I'll add in is the birth of Noah, which is presented as being similar to the Nephilim. So similar that Noah's father goes to Enoch and asks how his wife has conceived a nephilim if she is faithful. Reading this chapter is very insightful. First, it's revealed that the nephilim are from ""The north"" and that Enoch is preaching the OT gospel to them. It's revealed that they are light skinned and seem to glow. The details given give a rather clear picture: The Nephilim are white dudes that dark skinned people are not used to seeing. Their language is more poetic than factual. Noah is an albino, or possible even an illegitimate child due to his white skin.

What Noah shows is a first hand account of the confusion and uncertainty of different racial groups meeting. The same confusion which can be seen today when uncontacted tribes see white people for the first time.

Nephilim are just rather tall white people from the north. How North, who can say. Maybe they're from the Caucus, maybe Enoch went all the way North to Norway. He does, after all, describe the Northern Lights in his book.

So yea. Nephilim are vikings...in a certain lazy way to say it."
253,ega5ibx,"&gt;  racism is not something that I see being a problem here.

I appreciate your thoughts, but I disagree completely. Racsim is a problem, but perhaps not so easy to recognize because of the way that they give lip service to it, which convinces people, like yourself, that it is not a problem. The ideas about being 'white and delightsome' have not been ferreted our of the theology, they've just learned to talk about it in such a way that it sounds good on the surface. The belief is still there, because they still teach children that WHEN God changes a person's skin color because of their sin, the skin is made to be darker. There is no opposite story and it doesn't matter that later 'white' people become sinful in the book. It also doesn't matter if they teach people to not be overtly racist as long as they still teach that God dolls out dark skin as a punishment for sin. That is a wildly blatant racist story, which still exists and is still taught to children. I know a lot of mormons, and while some make a good show of not saying overtly racist things, the fundamental beliefs are still there and they still inform harmful ideas that allow mormons to support bad policy. For example, a common sentiment is about how dark-skinned people are not successful because they're lazy and institutional disenfranchisement is not a real thing. That is a real belief with a lot of mormons, although they won't admit that it'a a skin color thing."

256,e0i7tgp,"&gt; This is true, because we have limited immigration. Immigration is difficult and thus is attracts the most motivated.

This is completely untrue and belies a total misunderstanding of the policies behind immigration law on your part. Immigration *can* be difficult but often is not especially prohibitive, and this has often been true in American history -- like when my Irish forebearers came to this country, generally illiterate and without even the ability to speak English (which didn't become the majority language in Ireland until after An Gorta Mor.) They were able to stay because in the 1850's there effectively *were no* immigration laws. These people had the option of accepting private charity. You know what they did? They worked. 

&gt;There are mainly two types that come in.Those who are able bodied or skilled who will quickly rise up and retire in the top20%. Those who are illegal and thus don't apply for benefits because of their status.

What evidence do you have that people who do not fall into these categories collect welfare benefits at higher rates than the native population? 

The entire notion that most people cannot provide for themselves is completely erroneous. People without much education or socialization are able to provide for themselves. 

The story you're telling yourself about immigration (dark skinned people are too dumb and lazy to make due) isn't true. It helps to see if the facts fit the theory rather than assuming that the theory must be true so the facts must fit it. 

Hell, just for the sake of it, let's consider the following: Would the state of California (setting aside the Privileges and Immunities Clause) be justified in [preventing immigration from other states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okie) on your theory? Can they say ""only people with post-graduate degrees can come to California, because Oakies will sap the welfare state?"" If not, what the hell difference does it make that someone was born outside the U.S.? "
257,e0jr6cm,"&gt; The story you're telling yourself about immigration (dark skinned people are too dumb and lazy to make due) isn't true.

This is pure nonsense. 

You painting anyone who doesn't agree with you a racist doesn't help your cause.  

Immigrants are hard working.  They are also low skilled and lack the support networks when they don't come through the proper channels.  This leads to greater dependency.

259,dm99f0r,"I didn't really expect such a person's foray into linguistics to go well, at all. And my expectations were met. Let me quote-translate the relevant passages and apply some R4 to them.

*Context: a black German politician, Karamba Diaby, of the social-democratic party saw a post on the* ***N***~~S~~***D***~~A~~***P***'*s facebook showing an election ad of Diaby's. The post decried the social-democrats for having betrayed the German people. Implicitly, the alleged betrayal consists of the candidate being black. You know, that's bad. Diaby crossposted the racist jab at him saying ""I am not your Negro"", to which the Nazi leader Frank Franz (hilarious how every involved person has an awesome name in this story) reacted by publishing a public letter addressed to Diaby.*

&gt;Let me also comment on the term ""Neger"" that not we, but you introduced into this discussion.

Diaby had reacted to the Nazis by telling them ""I am not your negro"". First of all, ""negro"" is obviously not the same word at all, it's not even the same language. Also, the Nazi seems to not know the phrase. He begins defending himself against an accusation that Diaby hadn't even directed at him. Interesting. Gets better though.

&gt;However, to me, the term ""Neger"" is no slur. Its negative connotation is not justified in rational terms but rather stems from the fact that everything in Germany is subject to an insane process of re-interpretation.

Connotations aren't rational. Language isn't rational. Hot take, I know.     
Apart from connotations often coming from associative thinking or other seemingly chaotic, ""irrational"" connections, the n-word in Germany does have its history. The ""enlightened"" and very much racist thinkers used it, the colonialists used it extensively and the Nazis with seats in the parliament used it as well. A lot less irrational when you consider these people's attitudes towards non-white people, eh?

&gt;Dark-skinned people are generally denoted as ""Neger"", which is evident from the origin of the word (for instance Latin ""niger"" for ""black"") . And your skin is indeed very dark. Only a few years ago, anyone – even over-sensitive liberals – would have called you a ""Neger"" without any ill-intention whatsoever.

Oooooh boy. That first sentence is just. I mean, lo and behold, a racist admits to 'generally' behaving in racist ways.

There you also have the eponymous etymological fallacy (everyone drop a coin in their ""etymological fallacy box""). You know, cause some other word in a different language that later evolved to be the word at hand, THAT'S where meaning truly is =) (R4: it's not)

Also, he lives in a world where even the ""worst"" of liberals would have used that term only ""a few years back"". I'm too lazy to seriously deal with this any longer, but I bet my aryan bloodline that there's tons of sources disproving exactly that.

It will surprise absolutely nobody that the Nazi had also accused Diaby of ""starting an apeshow"" which is a German expression for starting a wild controversy. The reason behind the choice of that particular expression, though, should be obvious. There are other, similarly lazily hidden strategies of calling Diaby inappropriate things."
260,dlmmfhk,"None of this is the fault of Mexicans, though, is it?  As easy as it is to look down and blame them, it's a fault of the system.  It's the same in almost any country.  Germany's dark-skinned people are typically Turks.  Russia's are Chechens.  Et cetera.

You aren't wrong for feeling annoyed and you are correct that you aren't Mexican, but you're blaming the victims and not the perpetrators.  This is a great time for you to see how societies often function subconsciously.  You've trained yourself to hate the wrong people (hate's a strong word here).

Also, I don't know ""which Hispanic"" you are, but I'm willing to bet that country has the same stereotypes about someone else.  Stereotypes tend to be the same everywhere, just applied to different people.  Everyone always thinks the other people are the wrong kind of drunks, for instance, or lazy."
261,dk6sqln,"2nd Nephi 5:21-25 is summarized with the following: 

* Dark skin makes people ""not enticing"" and ""loathsome""

* Dark skinned people can turn white if they repent

* Mixing seed with dark skinned people is a sin and those that do this will be cursed as well

* Dark skinned people are lazy and ""full of mischief"" 

How can people say that's racist?! Where do people get this crazy idea that racism is doctrinal?! /s"
262,emih85n,"That can be said about all of rascism, but I understand your point.
    
It's mainly an orthodox mentality of disgust for poor and socially backward people, which happen to be largely people of scheduled Castes. Also, people of dark skinned people are considered *not as beautiful* as people with fairer skins, and this does not face much societal opposition as it is not a racial issue"
263,dndzgnm,"Lack of dignity for manual labour is a thing here. Some people still ill treat manual labourers. I am not sure of people considering people with darker skin as lower class, since like I said the Southern part of India generally consists of people with darker skin compared to the rest of the sub continent and since around more than 20% of the country is like that, I don't think people can classify an entire region as lower class especially when said region is known to be slightly more progressive and educated compared to many other states in the country. It is just one of the many generalisations we have to face, for example, people ask my mom (she is fairer than me, I am more tending towards brown complexion, idek what complexion I am it varies, sometimes I look bleached, other times I am standing in front of the mirror wondering how I got so tanned) if she really is South Indian because they have this notion that all South Indians are very dark. Then my peers are like, oh, you are a South Indian, you guys are scholars right? Ofc you have to ace the exams. So with these two points I am not sure whether dark skinned people are considered to be lower class, because class though earlier was on the basis of wealth, nowadays education is also a factor for how much respect people have for you. My grandpa had very dark skin, yet he was one of the most respected persons in my native place mainly because he was a helpful person. But this may be a standalone case.

For those who are not naturally dark,  I think manual labour/labour work in the sun can cause tanned skin though. Because I have noticed that when I stay indoors for a long period of time, I look pale and when I regularly go outside in the sun, I turn dark. I think equating dark skin with manual labour shouldn't be a problem if you have dignity for labour, since dark skin isn't an abomination here, when you have half of the country as dark (with that I am not including only the South Indians since also people elsewhere in the country are dark too).

That said, it is pretty sad that even though India is blessed with diversity, we also are racists sometimes (things like white worshipping and the subtle racist behaviour of some people towards black people or people with mongoloid features or literally anyone, you can be a racist or mean against the racists too), but I hope it changes with time. But a lot of discourse happens around it and I hope the mindsets of these few people change. Then there's the caste issue we have in India, where there are some people who still differentiate people on the basis of their castes. We have reservations in schools and colleges and government jobs for the upliftment of backward classes and tribal people, but that isn't a perfect solution. If you go to r/India and search for racism, you would get to read some discussion on the issue, though I have to warn you that Indians there are pretty self-deprecating and you may wonder how people can be so self criticising of themselves, but it is a good thing. We need to criticise our own shortcomings."
