1,fsmy4ks,"Agreed; Where is this fervor toward respecting our community? We stuck our necks out from the 20s to the 60s and in the end we just got burned. Black musicians talk about greedy Jews stiffing them. Black TV idols make jokes about Jews and encourage the self-hating Jewish community's aspirations to portray Jews as weak nerdish shlemazals . Black Churches accuse us of being the spawn of Satan, or thieves of the ""birthright"" or go full blown weirdo with things like Black Hebrew Israelites. Black communities bordering Jewish ones have a history of tension and there were riots in places like Crown Heights. Every single Jewish New Yorker I personally know (at least 100) has a story about some petty crime a Black person did to them from malice or jealousy.

Already the non-religious and more liberal-leaning side of the Jewish community is giving unwavering support and has continued to give it in spite of the historical burning. My Facebook feed is full of these types saying we even have to eat the damages and attacks toward our community and the anti-Semitism for the over-all picture.

I think some things need to be settled before it's fair to call on us to put our full force behind people that don't seem to appreciate the last time we joined them. Particularly when it's a known that elements within the greater movement are gunning for us."
2,fl0njxv,"Have you been paying attention at all? Most people ARE going to get sick, the idea of social isolation is to avoid densely populated areas to slow down the spread so that hospitals don't get hit all at once. No hospital, anywhere in the world will be capable of dealing a massive increase in patients. Fear and greed will only make a delicate situation worse. You're saying the hospitals with the ability to care for 400 patients is already running low with only 4 patients? Believe it or not the number 4 is significantly lower than the number 400. Hospitals aren't running out of supplies because of actively sick people, they are running low because of healthy people panicking and taking more than they are do. People like you.
Again, these people aren't going out and licking door knobs. They are looking for a less densely populated area to isolate themselves. That's GOOD! It slows the spread in the densely populated areas which also slows the spread in the less densely populated areas! 
The Cape cannot survive in a bubble, nowhere can. You don't seem to realize that while the loss of life is going to be high, the economic impact is going to be enormous. If these people don't come down to the cape and spend money this year, a ton of people are going to be completely fucked.
People coming down, isolating themselves in their home (that they fucking own) and ordering takeout regularly is the absolute best thing that could be happening for the cape right now. 
Fear is not a good excuse to shut the door on people, it always has been the excuse of short sighted cowards and despots. Fear of loosing your job to Mexicans, fear that the Jewish folks are trashing your economy. Whatever your excuse, that ""us vs them"" attitude that always ends up being the justification for atrocities is absolutely NOT okay. In the coming days a lot of people are going to need help, slamming the door in their face because they're not ""like you"" is disgusting."
3,fjmkpee,"Jews entire history in Europe is molded by Christianity.  They became involved in finance because they were barred from doing just about everything else.  They had no ability to work land or own land so this forces you to value education.  By the modern era, this puts them in the advantageous position.

Also they are less likely to trust European governments like the Christian Europeans.  Jewish community is smarter about money... Not because of greed or cleverness but because of necessity.  So they don't suffer from drastic inflation, they don't expect the government to solve their problems because since Rome sacked Jerusalem in 69 AD every government on Earth has been the cause of their problems.

Jews get brought to countries in Europe... And then once they become richer than the average member of the population, someone blames everything on them and chases them out.

It happened tons of times in the middle ages.  Jewish expulsion from France, England, etc.

Holocaust was just the last time it happened and it happened with electricity and gasoline driven hatred.

So it was industrial scale slaughter.

But it's been happening since the Romans killed a Jew... and blamed it on the entire Jewish people and the illiterate sheep masses have believed it for millennia.

The same sheep masses that follow Crusader Kings and Nazis and Republican billionaires who are the actual plunderers of the populace."
4,fa9tksl,"&gt;If we're being honest in the discussion, then the only reason it's structurally close to antisemitism is because Jewish folks are really good, objectively speaking, at making money. (which isn't bad in my opinion)

""They live!"" is about a hidden power behind the surface, not so much about making money. there is a difference between the classic complain about Shylock, about Jews being greedy money makers, and modern antisemitism that makes a global cabal out of ""international jewry"". Society in ""They live!"" is portrayed as being bad because of evil extraterretrials looking like normal human beings that secretly control society. Very much like David Icke's take on the lizard people (which was probably influenced by the late 80s Mini series ""V"")."
5,egrnf2d,"&gt;That's not what I'm saying. Not at all. 

Your argument is that the antisemitic statements are too ""old fashioned"" to catch modern antisemites. I am saying that is patently absurd. An antisemite that believes jews are globalist elites would absolutely agree with that very first quote offered to them.

&gt;If a survey showed that 5 out of 6 gay people thought that Conservatives had a problem tackling homophobia, I wouldn't pretend that I know more about the topic than the gay community. And I certainly wouldn't imply that all gay people were using homophobia as a political attack. 

How about my hypothetical? You concede to the gay community on best knowing what it is talking about WRT conservatives having a bias, why would you contest them if they unanimously say that the very act of creating a conservative party was homophobic?

That's because the clear answer is that you would not believe them. Because you need more in an argument than just belief. That is why the majority of british jews saying Labour is antisemitic and conservatives are not holds no weight. Because the british-jewish community is overehelmingly tory and has no statistical proof to back up that accusation.

&gt;Nobody is saying that Labour's anti-semitism is a recent development. Or that Corbyn is the crux of the problem. 

Then what is.

&gt;Have you actually read ""On the Jewish question?"". Marx calls Jews ""egoists"" within the first paragraph and goes on to call them money-grabbing scam artists;

&gt;""What is the secular basis of Judaism? Practical need, self-interest. What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money.” - Karl Marx, On the Jewish Question, 1843. 

I have in fact read On The Jewish Question. Which is why it was a mistake for you to drag this out of context quote into the discussion. Here are the segments of the essay that add context to that quote:

http://imgur.com/a/TtEjnez

And here is what I wrote the last time someone tried using it:

&gt;Alright, let us start here: This precedes your quote. (Referring to image 1) Basically, what he said in your quote was intended to redirect Bauer's argument, which focused on their religion and demonized them through that. You might be thinking ""how is that better? It demonizes jews directly!""

&gt;This is why (referring to images 5, 2, and 3 in that order). In your quote he calls jews many things, yes. But in the writing after that quote he segues that into this point. Jews are greedy, self-interested scam artists.....just like the rest of the world. He absolves the jewish religion of Bauer's argument, then absolves the jewish german by pointing out that all of Bauer's accusations apply to the rest of human society, especially christian. 

&gt;Basically, imagine if you responded to a racist with ""yeah lets kill all those black people for being lazy! Then white people for being lazy!"" And then someone removed the latter half and accused you of wanting to murder black people. That is what you are doing with that screenshot.

&gt;Do you have polling showing strong anti-Arab sentiment among British Jews? It's completely irrelevant to my point, but I am interested to hear if it's a complete fabrication too. 

You asked me a question, I gave my belief interpreted from facts laid before me. Seeing as you yourself lack any polling that actually proves a connection between Labour or Leftism and antisemitism, it is rather rich of you to qccuse me of fabrication."
6,eeykdtx,"The funny thing is 90% of you think it was religious hate when nobody cared about their belief structure. Germany was pissed about the same thing the Jewish community is up to now as they act nepotistic in politics, business and romance. So many shows are like “Curb Your Enthusiasm” which largely cast Jewish actors. “that’s Hollywood” we’ll look at Tech CEO’s. Countless examples, and I think that’s great but a slippery slope. I imagine this will piss off reddit uneducated liberals but it was about money, greed. The German middle class was pissed about how the mainly Jewish political party handled WWI and it wasn’t Hitlers idea to genocide that beautiful community, it was his version of ‘the iron bank’ easier to use GOT references so you dum dums get it. That doesn’t excuse any Nazi whatsoever but it should spook you. We have a 29 yr old moron asking for 70% Marginal which in theory sounds good but it inflates everything wether or not the person or company even stays in the USA it definitely keeps the rich richer as nobody ‘new money’ would be able to come close to the “26 ppl own 50% of the wealth” and if you look it up its clearly them that own your Fox, CNN, Washington Post etc. Are we going to kill all the Jews again? Is it equality to take from the rich? That’s the funny thing about so many redditor ppl. It’s not conspiracy theory it’s right in front of you.

7,ecwlvl0,"You're generalizing, you do realize this, correct? That's the same as people saying all Chinese people only work and have no fun, or that all black people steal, shoot people, and listen to rap music. Or that all white people wear sweater-vests and listen to Sinatra, with their slicked-back haircut. What you're saying is completely anecdotal and holds no basis for any sort of argument, whatsoever.  And yes, cops DO get convicted for crimes. You're literally looking at things through a closed and biased mind. You're looking at things from your own biased perception of police. Like I've stated before, there are kind cops, there are not-so-kind cops. Just as both sides exist in any profession. You're simply generalizing. Along the same lines, you could generalize and say things such as

\-All Americans are cocky assholes.

\-Women are bad drivers.-Jewish individuals are always greedy and love money.

\-Muslims are terrorists.

And the list of ignorance and stupidity goes on and on and on

These are the same kind of things you're stating right now. You're being incredibly ignorant and closed-minded, and you are completely unintelligent of the things you're trying to argue about. You're actually THE problem that's keeping racism, sexism, 'religionism', etc., in this world.

So please. Do EVERYONE a favor and try to actually learn what you're talking about, instead of making baseless assumption from stereotypes. Please grow up and actually try using your brain. Thanks."
8,e7y8ol8,"Almost totally contained among low information edgelords I think. I've heard a few people call someone a jew as a statement of their greed and a couple of conspiracy nuts claiming that ""they"" control the world. I haven't really met anyone to go full hog into antisemitism which makes sense as our jewish community is very small and basically invisible. We even repurposed the word we historically used to call jews into a word that we now use to call people from other ex Yugoslav countries. The word Čifut used to be a turkish word for jews and now it morphed into the word Čefur."

11,di3sqyt,"I think that there's several different factors which are driving anti-Jewish sentiment on the Left, but by far the single most important factor is Zionism. 

Jews have become [increasingly braggadocious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFE0qAiofMQ) about the leading role that they served in fostering the so-called ""civil rights movement"" now that they've managed to brainwash the vast majority of people in the world to agree with them. They pimped the narrative that Whites are evil and privileged oppressors and people of color are their poor, innocent victims. But that narrative has backfired on Jews when it comes to Zionism.

Much like how Richard Spencer [brilliantly and hilariously argued](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V054eqVFaXs) in response to a rabbi that tried to pull the ""openness, diversity, love, and inclusion"" mindtrick on him at a press conference, I think that Zionism is an even more extreme version of Alt-Right ideology in the sense that White Ashkenazi Jews in America, Europe, and Russia used dubious historical, moral, and ideological justifications to mass migrate to Palestine, demographically displace the native Arab Muslim population, and erect what is essentially a militant Jewish ethnostate (which has largely been dominated by White Western Ashkenazi Jews since its founding) in the heart of the Arab Muslim world. Oy vey. The chutzpah. 

It's especially ironic for Jews (and their cuckservative goyim supporters) to denounce the Arab Muslim Palestinians for using terrorism, Arab and Islamic supremacist rhetoric, and anti-Jewish rhetoric in order to establish a Palestinian state since Zionists used terrorism, Jewish supremacist rhetoric, and anti-Islamic and anti-Arab rhetoric in order to establish Israel. If Hamas is a terrorist organization, then so was the Irgun which eventually became the Likud party - the current ruling party in Israel which is led by Netanyahu.

So, since the modern Left now largely revolves around eradicating ""White Supremacy"" and uplifting people of color (and, again, Jews are largely responsible for fostering this worldview), this has caused the Left to turn on the Zionists because the optics of a bunch of highly educated and wealthy White Ashkenazi Jews using advanced Western military technology to dominate desperately poor brown people makes the Left see red.

Jews fostered open borders, mass immigration, diversity, tolerance, and White Guilt in order to fully liberate themselves from White oppression and undermine their White oppressors, but the intersectional social justice Frankenstein monster that they played a leading role in creating has turned on them a bit when it comes to Zionism and Jewish privilege generally. Now a relatively large percentage of the Left routinely denounces Israel for being a militantly racist and oppressive apartheid state, and the immense amount of wealth and power that Jews have accumulated has also drawn Leftist ire since they hate the bourgeoisie with a genocidal passion.   

And I agree with you that a lot of the infighting within the Jewish community is for show in the sense that the real source of contention is their paranoia over how non-Jews will perceive their actions. I think that a lot of the liberal Jews that criticize Israel's more egregious forms of [racism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pajvvFujDt4) and [imperialism](https://youtu.be/7NMwohMhP10) are more worried about it reflecting poorly on Israel and Jews as a whole than a genuine concern for the human rights of Palestinians.

And I also echo what I think is your sentiment about the importance of accurately describing Jewish power and influence. Overestimating Jewish power and influence can be problematic, but so can underestimating Jewish power and influence. Jews are probably [the single most powerful and influential voice in the world](http://thezog.info/list-summaries/) (disclaimer: I don't endorse all of the content on that blog), but they don't control everything. If Jews really did directly control our foreign policy rather than just heavily influence it, then we would have bombed and invaded Iran years ago. They're obviously trying to push us in that direction, but the disastrous consequences of the Iraq War [(which was basically a Jewish neocon conspiracy)](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/white-man-s-burden-1.14110) are still fresh in the minds of most Americans (and [the anti-war Left is aware of hawkish Jewish lobbying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_U.S._Foreign_Policy), at least to some degree).

As to your comments about globalism; this isn't really related to the topic of left-wing anti-Jewish sentiment, but I think that Star Trek gives you a pretty good idea of how the Jewish-led liberal movement perceives their end goals for humanity, especially [the most recent series](https://youtu.be/4dxe_ugmIVM) which is almost completely devoid of White people. Nation states have been abolished and replaced with a global government; borders have been torn down and countries that were previously White Supremacist like America are now extremely racially mixed and tolerant; world peace and equality has been achieved; we no longer need money; et cetera.

The liberal perception of human history typified by Whig historiography (basically the belief that society is destined to become more liberal and advanced politically, culturally, and scientifically over time), Marxism, Boasian cultural relativism, et cetera, was especially fervently embraced and espoused by the Jewish community. Jews and other liberals have been repeatedly expressing for at least a century their desire to progress humanity forwards towards a more higher form of evolution where the primitive ideas of nation states and races (which are chimp-like and foster tribalism, greed, and war in their view) are replaced with global governance and a [racially mixed beige-colored global citizenry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb55teb1gJ0) (fun fact: Jews and their liberal allies in the first half of the 20th century would typically cite the ancient Egyptians as their vision for this new mixed race global citizen that they wanted to create). 

That's what the rainbow coalition of liberals headed by Jews are pushing us towards. But in my view, it will almost certainly end in disaster. I'm also not even convinced that they're mostly motivated by benevolence towards humanity and a utopian vision for the future, but are instead motivated by hatred, vengeance, and jealousy towards White people. Either way, the end result will be the same: Whites being dispossessed and blended out of existence, and Western living standards greatly declining, or at least not being anywhere near as high as they would have been had Whites been allowed to maintain their racially homogeneous societies. They think that they're creating Star Trek, I think that they're creating a global dysgenic favela.

So, once you understand that they're trying to push us towards a neo-Marxist and globalist Star Trekian future, that will help you to understand why Jews and their liberal puppets support mass non-White and Islamic immigration into the White Western world even if those demographic groups won't be as pro-Jewish as the native White population. Just like how the vast majority of American Jews still support the Democrat Party and venomously despise Republicans even though the Democrat Party has become mildly anti-Zionist and the Republican Party may as well be renamed to the Zionist Party, the Democrat Party, and their rapidly growing non-White base, is still sufficiently pro-Jewish and pro-Zionist enough to maintain a solid majority of Jewish support. And that's because Jews are far more interested in making America less White and less conservative than they are in aligning themselves with a political movement that is predominantly comprised of socially conservative White Christians that are pathologically pro-Zionist. Nobody likes cuckservatives, not even the Jews that cuckservatives pathetically worship. "
12,evpvqmt,"This is in the news.

Ironically, this tends to be something I ague in favor of. Any sort of dissent, any sort of resistance, these things are bad. 

I believe order is far more valuable than truth. Keeping people happy, functional, contented, and working is far more valuable than telling people the truth. The truth often does nothing but cause problems, endless indignation, frustration, shame, dispair, and hatred.

Just look at plenty of current ""conspiracy theories"" that are supported by large amounts of evidence, but to condemn them in public makes you ""insane"" or, more so nowadays, a ""Domestic terrorist/Nazi/fascist/etc""

The other somebody said, targeting the rich is different than targeting Jews, Jews are a very tiny minority that have very small % share of the absolute power in the world.

I said Jews are very influential in the world, despite being 0.2% of the global population, 19% of the World's 200 richest people are Jewish.

Then the guy calls me an anti-semite. Somehow even acknowledging the fact that the Jewish community is influential and powerful has become antisemitism.

Enjoy being monitored because of the fact that you are now labeled as ""domestic terrorists"" by the FBI.

It really helps you think you've got  a friend. Somebody who cares what you say, somebody who understands what you're saying, believes what you are saying, even if their intent is to silence and discredit you.

To be fair, the amount of paid agenda shills, and otherwise brainwashed people who function in  an intendtical manner is so incredibly high, that there truly is no real threat that is posed by conspiracy theorists.

You are ultimately powerful. You tell people some facts, then they double down on what they already believe in, regardless of what it is.

You tell somebody a fact, that's a damn shame, because now that person is 200% more certain that whatever they believe, or are expected to believe is 100% true.

It's a losing battle, but truly to think Conspiracy theorists are somehow a threat is laughable. They're no more a threat than a random child bearing man is to his broodmother and children.

Screw-loose people will be violent, this is completely independent from being a loony, a conspiracy theorist.

As conspiracy theorists are clearly not a threat and more than any random mentally ill or mentally unstable individual, this makes you wonder what caused this?

Somebody must have said something that upset them.

Though I am clearly a delusional narcisssus, I entertain the thought  that it is someone like me.

I don't argue for people vs government revolution, I argue in favor of government vs government, of defeating conspirators with a greater degree of conspiracy.

I criticize the world controllers, not for controlling the world,  but for doing it poorly, attaining poor results.

As truly these people are only a threat to one another, as the general population is completely powerless, this would mean that threat comes from the inside.

That would mean the current dominant world controllers are threatened by a minority group of world controllers, which seeks to win absolute power by conspiring to an even greater extreme than the current ones.

They are afraid of change, because they know they are weak, meek, pitiful. They know a world controller seeking to exhibit a much greater degree of control, a much more organized, empirical, and rational degree of control would yield much greater results than the current methods employed by world controllers. 

These methods rely on subtlety, and just as one will have trouble enforcing the law or disciplining a child with subtle means, they know that more direct and deliberate means coming into existence are a threat to their current way of life, which is just using subtle means to maintain a loose grip on society, but enough of a grip to make plenty of money, and accomplish what you seek to accomplish, to varying degrees of success.

They know they will have no ability to compete with any nations that in turn elect to  employ less subtle methods. Just look at China, their world controllers are far less subtle, they rule with a much greater degree of force and strength than they do by the Western methods of suggestion and appeasement. 

The results the Chinese attain are comparably greater, at least with regard to economic growth. When you disregard the shackles of Western idealism, you soon realize that you are far more capable and powerful that you once thought yourself to be."

15,fxxt99x,"Very unlikely in the UK at least. With anti antisemitism on the increase the Jewish community is justifiably on their guard and won't take kindly to this. Even if your reasons are not anti semitic, thats how it will look.  Against them there isn't really a movement to outlaw it and no scientific evidence that it is wrong. Its simply incomparable to FGM.

The amount of botched circumcisions are so small as to be negligible, as much as they are personal disasters when they happen. But then loads of perfectly safe and routine things occasionally see freak accidents that cause personal disaster.

You should also consider deeper logic in trying to outlaw circumcision. In doing this you would definitely still get Jews pursuing it- whether its wasting money they may not have flying off to Israel to get it done, or,   potentially far more dangerous, in less sanitary backroom procedures performed by amateurs. 

You don't necessarily have to agree with something to look at the grim logic and figure it is best legalised, regulated, and kept safe."
16,fysd93s,"We're specifically talking about Massachusetts. I live in Mass, and I can assure you that FGM is not ""popular"" here where circumcision is the norm.  I can also assure you that Jewish folks are not the only ones practicing circumcision. The fact that you bring that up is telling."
17,fo7cjd6,"Ok, so I‘ve scrolled through a lot of comments now and so far haven’t seen these points made, so here goes:

1. People need to be careful about this discussion, as it is a common anti-Semitic and islamophobic talking point. Not saying holding the opinion equals being an anti-semite, just keep an eye out for who you’re agreeing with. (That being said, I am not a fan of circumcision myself, it’s just that I don’t want to jump onto the wrong bandwagon, if ya know what I mean, especially when Jewish folks are often mentioned for little else.)

2. FGM: I am not an expert on this, so correct me if I’m wrong, but surely circumcision does NOT equal female genital mutilation? One is a medical procedure to protect from STDs that is often performed without the need to, the other is a harm- and painful way of subjugating women’s sexuality/bodies so as to keep them “pure”. Again, maybe I’m mistaken, but if I’m not then saying one is as bad as the other is not only sensationalising this issue but also trivialising FGM. And again: Circumcision might have medical benefits (which is what the debate is about), FGM is an inhumane, cruel act of violence motivated by misogyny.

I’m sure you can take it up with Mayo Clinic.

Besides, circumcision in adults and young men has a much higher rate of infection. It’s is safer to do it when they’re  babies. And if you are getting penis shamed because of not having foreskin, then maybe it’s time to expand your social circle or dump the girl. I hear the Jewish community is very welcoming."

21,fctxqpe,"You are a clown. Anti-semitism is nothing but a media catch phrase to ban any criticism of people who arent even semitic.

In NYC, mohels sucks on childrens penises after cutting them, also illegal, and Jewish community is protected under ""religious rights"" even when this crime has spread herpes and killed children. People who insist that religion has nothing to with circumcision no nothing about circumcision. Even American circumcision was started in the Anglophone by puritanical zealots. Rape apologists like you are a cancer to MRA. You dont know anything about antisemitism. It is simply a word you learned.  How about watch Eric Eric clopper's 2 hour stage play about everything you need to know about circumcision. Religion come up about 70% of the time. He is a jew himself. Everything he says is a fact.

22,f9vunwi,"&gt;Cutting off the foreskin poses no threat to human life and has absolutely no effect on the quality of life of a person

This is just not true. There are many studies that show a reduction in sexual pleasure among circumcised people, for example:   [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847).

Also the pain from circumcision releases large amounts of cortisol (pain and stress hormone), which has various consequences, see:  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/moral-landscapes/201501/circumcision-s-psychological-damage](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/moral-landscapes/201501/circumcision-s-psychological-damage)

Also babies have died from being circumcised.

&gt; In fact, some even say it promotes hygiene. 

Certainly not the scientific consensus. Most health organizations in the world with statements on circumcision are opposed to circumcising children. This would not be the case if the consensus was that it was healthier.

&gt; How about this: Make it ilegal for everybody except Jews then 

Giving special rights to religious people is one of the worst ideas possible. Equality is important.

&gt; because no one in the Jewish community is against it. Not even those who have been circumcised. 

Completely untrue. I know a danish organization, Intact Denmark, was founded by circumcised jews who were upset about being circumcised. You can find countless other examples just by searching ""Jews against circumcision""."

## Working Off the Past, from Atlanta to Berlin

[**Susan Neiman**](https://www.nybooks.com/contributors/susan-neiman/) 

 [https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/08/26/working-off-the-past-from-atlanta-to-berlin/](https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/08/26/working-off-the-past-from-atlanta-to-berlin/) 

Following on from the TA article noted below, this is a somewhat more personal and affecting excerpt from Neiman's recent book.   I found it hopeful.  Also ironic that in Berlin at least (some) Germans seem to be handling multiculturalism somewhat better than the proverbial melting pot we live in.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;What about the Jewish question? Thirty years ago, I wished that Germans were aware I was Jewish, or at least weren’t shocked when they found it out. Although they often knew quite a lot about concentration camps, they knew next to nothing about living, breathing Jews. This year, several German friends sent emails wishing me happy new year, in Hebrew. A Swiss Jewish historian is the president of the German Historical Museum. Berlin now hosts an annual Jewish film festival, a Jewish Culture week, an Israeli-German arts festival, several Jewish magazines, and no end of hummus joints. Should you wish to become a rabbi, you can choose between a Reform, a Conservative, and an Orthodox seminary. Thanks to Chabbad, the Lauder Foundation and immigrants from Russia, the Orthodox Jewish community is growing, as is the community of Israelis who leave their country to escape its Orthodox-dominated government. Being Jewish is so fashionable that a number of German rabbis are actually converts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Buying matzo in the 1980s was not quite secret, but it carried an aura of stealth. There was only one store that sold it, along with kosher wine, gefilte fish, mezzuzot, and falafel. After the store was bombed in 1977, the owners exchanged the sign reading “shalom”for one that read “oriental specialties.” You had to know where you were going in order to get there. Now, the only problem in shopping for Pesach is the fact of competition, as I discovered on a last-minute search for matzo meal last year. Everyone was sold out. “We underestimated,” said one owner. “Don’t bother going across town. There’s no matzo meal left in Berlin.” As I was wondering how long it would take to grind matzo piece by piece, I remembered that the parents of Israeli friends who were coming for Pesach might bring an extra box. You read that correctly. Israelis left home to enjoy the Seder with their children and grandson in Berlin. Next year in Jerusalem?  
&gt;  
&gt;Nothing reflects the change in spirit more than the commemoration of May 8. In 1985, President Richard von Weizsäcker made headlines as the first major West German politician to call the day the war ended a day of liberation. Until then, the German defeat was viewed with ambivalence, and whoever was not ambivalent kept quiet. I failed to appreciate the speech at the time, for I could not grasp that the taste of defeat was still so bitter forty years after the war that Weizsäcker’s use of the word *liberation* was revolutionary. (Imagine Virginians celebrating the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, and you’ll have a rough idea of the effect.)  
&gt;  
&gt;Today, one of the directors of the Maxim Gorki Theater is Israeli, and the theater produced a three-day festival to commemorate the war’s end. There were edgy theater and video productions, sassy dialogue about Jewish and Muslim gay men, a comedy about circumcision, and a discotheque playing a mishmash of hip-hop and Russian folk. “We have something to celebrate!” shouted one of the organizers as we danced to an accordion in the foyer. Outside the theater, over Berlin’s largest boulevard, a flag fluttered. “We won,” it read in German, English, and Russian. After Weizsäcker’s speech, antifascist Germans, foreigners, and the few Jews in town breathed a sigh of caustic relief: finally, a West German politician admitted that May 8 was not a day to mourn. But to celebrate it with a flag that declared “we won”? I cannot imagine who would have dared."
24,f2wqo6r,"Is hypocrisy newsworthy when the issue for which one is being hypocritical is not?  Seems like something that their community can deal with without an exposé by the media.

If beating on the orthodox Jewish community is appealing, I'd start with the vaccinations, annual chicken abuse, sucking of baby penis during circumcision, rampant sexual abuse of children, women's rights, improprieties of the Shomrim, *etc.*, before bothering with the sex parties.  The latter really seems like a non-issue to me."
25,eyhyetm,"Hm.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brit_milah#Metzitzah_B'Peh_(oral_suction)

If I call this ""filthy"", and say the people who practice *oral suction* circumcision are ""disgusting"", and that I don't want them living near me, or becoming overrepresented in my government, or a democratic majority that simple governs me in that way.....


.....is that anti-Semitic? 

________________

What I'm asking is, regardless of how someone feels personally about *oral suction circumcision*, is a separate person's critique of that practice, the people who practice it, and their status as members of government necessarily ""anti-Semitic"", i.e.  **politically illegitimate?**

To put an even finer point on it, *what criticism of Jews, Jewish practice, or Jewish community is not_ anti-Semitic, i.e. is not simply totally 'politically illegitimate'?*

To put an even finer, finer point on it, *if there is never any criticism of Jews 'allowed' to be politically legitimate*, what on earth do we expect people to conclude about Jews and political power?"
26,ezw9oku,"I didn't know that parts of the Jewish community is against it, but obviously I should have realized that not everyone is onboard! I wish you the best of luck in your fight against circumcision."
27,erq6put,"Now would be a good time to ask yourself what you want in your marriage. I hope you want to raise your children Jewish (if not, then no need to read further). If you do, really try to understand the details of how you want them to be raised Jewish. I was in a long-term relationship with a non-Jew who initially agreed to raise children Jewish, but when it came to the details - circumcision, no Christmas, no pork/shellfish - he immediately pushed back on everything. He was only willing to raise kids Jewish if it didn't inconvenience him, but we all know that's not possible. Living in a Jewish home and raising a Jewish family is always living in inconvenience and it's very, very rare that a non-Jew is willing to spend their life that way.

It's best to have these discussions before you fall in love with someone, but it seems like you've already fallen in love. To prevent further heartbreak, if you're serious about your future with him, have these discussions now. Don't waste time."

29,epn8pay,"Hopefully legislation will be passed putting mohels on the list of designated persons allowed to perform certain procedures. I imagine the Jewish community is doing all they can to make this happen.

I feel very strongly about this and completely agree with Mr. Loonstein. Prohibiting circumcision is interfering with our religious freedom. I realize that many people oppose routine circumcision and that's fine. I don't have a problem about others not circumcising their children or even outlawing it for other-than-religious purposes. But for us it is mandatory.

People on this board will understand why the practice is so important and is non-negotiable. I'm glad there's a place where I can put in my 2 centss about this and not have to repeat the same thing over and over."

Did you not read the description or the question?"
32,ef3xdcr,"Originally, Sigd was just another name for biggest jewish holiest day of the year named Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement). This day is connected to biblical Abraham getting his *brit mila, circumcision,* to indicate his loyalty and agreement with the God. Yom Kippur is also connected to Exodus and story of Moses recieving the Ten Commandments. Some of the children of the Israel believed, that during the 40 days Moses was not with them, something happened to him and asked Aaron, brother of Moses, to build them an altair to pray upon. Aaron gathered their golden ornaments and created a Golden Calf, similar to Apis Bull cult in Egypt. When Moses returned from Mount Sinai, God wanted to destroy Israelites praying to the Golden Calf, but Moses asked him to spare their lifes. However other part of Old Testament also talks about massacre of those that worshiped the Calf. However, Yom Kippur is connected to the *brit mila* OF Abraham and God´s forgiveness of the creation of Golden Calf.

The Sigd in Ethiopian jewish community is connected to the people of Axum and sepparation of jewish and christian population. Sigd represents the acceptance or Tanakh (or Torah) by ethiopian jews and their religious connection. Today, its recognised as sepparate holiday from Yom Kippur and officially accepted as holiday by Israel. "
33,effbmd2,"Ok that seems even more of a stretch. I highly doubt the Jewish community is going to become criminals if we stop circumcisions. I'm sorry it's just not plausible sounding and there are far more reasons to put an end to circumcision. A curious thought would be to see if you think this is happening with outlawing of vaginal mutilation? Are you associated groups that take part in this being actively pursued beyond legal action? I think mutilating infants or minors of any ages' genitals is wrong. They are not able to give consent. If an 18 year old Jew (or any of the non Jewish people that believe in circumcision, which you seem unconcerned with) decided to go ahead and get one done, that is their adult choice. A 1 month or one day old doesn't have that consent to give. And it is a decision that influences their entire life."
34,ecxbqdv,"I had to make an account just to call **MAJOR BS** on this post and here is why:

&gt;my wife and I have been **married 6 years** and we are both 33 ... we have two **daughters already, 3 and 7)**

First tell of bullshit. If your wife is as religious as you make her out to be, there is an extremely slim chance you would have a daughter outside of wedlock within a religiously Jewish household, let alone community.

&gt;... wife is planning on having our son circumcised because her religion requires it (Jewish) ... no reason at all other than an antiquated and stupid tradition that has no benefits in the modern world ...  the children are automatically brought into the religious community by means of their mother (not father), this makes my son Jewish

Unless this was a one night stand and you did not get to know her at all (which is highly doubtful) you absolutely knew that her being from a religious Jewish background would bring all of the above if you had children.

Why do I highly doubt you didn't have prior knowledge? Religious Jews are not likely to marry outside of their religion because of the conflict with non-Jews concerning religious ceremony (much like other religions). When she decided to be with you I am 100% sure these things were brought up at some point. **She wouldn't have taken the relationship so far if she was sure you would not respect her religion and community/family.** Jewish families are infamous for vetting future spouses. I have been  in a 1 year + relationship with a **modern** (not that religious) Israeli and this is still part of the family norm.

&gt;...her parents essentially took us both in and let us live in one of their apartment properties that they own in NYC, so they’re is extremely heavy religious and social pressure on us to have a circumcision performed. ... Additionally, they helped my younger brother out who had special needs (down’s) and they allow him to work at their Deli.

Living in NYC doesn't automatically make anyone heavily religious (more **culturally** Jewish maybe, but **not more religious**) there is no correlation at all. It's like you are purposely trying to imply something more here (like she's part of the ultra orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn; in which case you would have never met her, had a relationship or had children).

Forgot to mention, her family are strict Jews and they let you, **a married couple, along with  2 kids live with them**?  You had no plan on where to live, you brought your brother, and you keep having babies, yet your a man without a plan. The strict Jewish community is in no way like the Christian or Catholic community where they would allow a man to marry their daughter and not have a plan for their future living arrangements. Where oh where did you get the idea they would provide your growing family and brother with full living arrangements and that would be a-okay? 

Did you decide to add the special needs brother working at their Deli as a bonus? That's sick guy. They own apartments and a deli, ugh the level of stereotype here... idk what to even say about that. This only adds to how much of a fuck up your ignorance on issue has been. Now you are messing with your brother's future as well.

&gt;As for why I was indifferent until now, as I’m sure some may ask - I was circumcised at a young age and I didn’t even know what they meant until my college fresh year roommate was European and his dick wasn’t snipped.

Then you say:

&gt;I also never gave it much thought even once knowing, until recently, when a Facebook friend of mine shared a review of a movie out that allegedly “exposes circumcision as a medical sham” (his words not mine), and I curiously watched the movie.Needless to say I have changed my mind about it since seeing the film

So at  **27 when you met your very Jewish wife, the bris never came into the conversation?**  And  now **at 33, after having been with this woman for at least 7 years;** In the seven years you have realized just how religious she  is, it took a fucking movie for this to even become questionable in your mind?  Was her religion not taken seriously until the point of watching this movie? Did you have magick sperm that prevented you from having sons and this one happened to be the unicorn? It took another guy's review of a movie on **Facebook** to get you to think about this?

Why are you circumcised? how the fuck would you even know the sensations you are missing? Because a friend told you how different his dick was than yours? If it took a movie for you to realize what your wife's religion would mean when having children **after 7+ years of being together,** you are clueless enough that you wouldn't have felt the slightest difference of sensation in you cock anyway.

OP and this post are fake as fuck! You can see exactly what he is aiming for by the comments people are sending. It's also really funny how u/Postbunnie suggested OP talk his wife into an [alternative ceremony](https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/a-new-alternative-to-jewish-circumcision/32930) and OP completely ignored that suggestion.

That says anti-semitism, not criticizing Jews. There's a big difference. Slippery meet slope.

&gt;You're just discounting a highly revered man's opinion outright. Martin  Luther was an extremely brave and morally courageous man to have been  the front runner of the Protestant Revolution. I happen to think it's  worth consideration that he and Karl Marx both noticed trends within the  Jewish culture that are so quick to be dismissed nowdays.

I never said Jews are without their faults to be criticized. But using a biased 500 year old (in my opinion) biased source is not very relevant to today.

36,e0h88c9,"But seriously, there is no real Danish jewish community of note.

37,dxyo4x2,"The illigalization of circumcision of young boys for no other reason than for a medical purpose, while the morally right thing to do, will move to destabilize the only working democrazy in the Middle East. 

While circumcision is a worse form of physical and social control than the say the burka, the consequences of banning it, without first a reform of the practicing comminities, could have grave consequences. The more countries that follow this ban, like Iceland may, the worse it would get. Once the ball starts rolling, how many countries will it be by 2030? Maybe much of the EU.

If we say, that it should be illegal, and that the practice should be abolished, how many people from the jewish community do you think would stay in the country and choose not to circumcise their child? 90&amp;#37;? Or more like 10&amp;#37;? All the joung couples expecting babies might stay, if they are educated enough by western standards, or they might all feel hindered in living, and move to some place else where they can live more freely. Free from our definition of human rights. 

Now scale this up, until it is illegal on the entire continent. Maybe even the world, and you could see why it is a problem for our jewish community and much of the arab world. 

""They must change"", we say. And some jewish people might stop, those 10&amp;#37;. The people following Islam might not be too opposed to a ban, considering the practice to them, seem less religious, than to the jewish community. The jewish community is already seen to be much harder to convince. 

What will most likely happen, is that we will be forced into a position of either condemning a people and its entire culture, when they refuse to stop their practice, or give up on upholding basic human rights, when the new rules take place. This will either split us off from important geopolitical alliance partners or weaken the human rights validity. The rights as they are, have been hard won already. And this fight is not a minor one, tho as it may seem. 

Diplomatically, it is a disaster. People in this thread, are already talking about how we shouldn't just ignore other human rights violations from foreign countries, and how we should adjust our diplomatic dealings accordingly. But Considering the rapid changes happening in the world today, this relativly minor issue, though morally right, would be a considerable keg of powder added to a growing pile. 

It is not difficult to understand why our politicians, in no uncertain terms, have been told by our american friends, how this is a really bad idea, and how, from a broad perspective, the consequences are a lot worse than any perceived reward gained. The American stance is clear, and that itself could cause a major diplomatic crisis in the future, that could split NATO partners and make war in the future more likely.

A ban is a logical next step seen from a moral perspective. From a marvellian, you would sacrifice the children, in a geopolitical chess match, where small differences aren't enough to discard allies. Acceptance of differences can be hard to the common people it seems, but not to the state. It cannot afford to be moral, when its very existence may rely on it, five decades down the line. 

Considering that morality is always fluid and changes over time, then enforcing a ban with this argument, may be a wrong and hurried decision that we could end up regretting."

A small, but nonexistent Jewish population that is already up in arms about the ban. I mean, that's not surprising, but don't act like politicians don't care about that. They pay attention to even the smallest of complaints, if it so much as makes them look a little bad.

&gt;How do religious figures have an influential say in a country that's pretty much entirely atheist? But you wouldn't understand, all you know about Iceland is that they shoot Game of Thrones there, and this bill that isn't even ready to be voted on.

The country is not ""entirely"" atheist if there are religious communities, you dum dum. If anything, Muslims and Jews, the few that even there, will band together and try their hardest to stop it, because they've even gone so far as to rile up other Jewish communities in other European countries.  This happened in Germany, thanks to lazy accusations of antisemitism and so-called ""Islamophobia"". It didn't take long for their politicians to cave in.

&gt;Feminism is such a little deal because pretty much everyone supports their ideals

Lol, and their ideals don't include banning circumcision.

&gt;and that had nothing to do with our PM being voted into power

There was never a chance of any anti-feminist/right-wing person being voted in.

&gt;but you don't know how that came to happen,

Feminists voted other feminist into power. Dum dum.

&gt;uneducated about our culture

What culture is that? Careful now, you might piss off the multiculturalists if you say the wrong thing.

&gt;politics

Your country voted in a left-leaning feminist. I'm pretty sure, dum dum, that it kind of represents the political lean of a country with a small population of people. You need to think before you speak.

&gt;But I appreciate the irony

Stop using the word irony. You don't know what it means and you don't use it the right way. Dum dum.

42,dvbasll,"I know I'm probably gonna get downvoted to hell for this, but fuck it: I have a slight preference for circumcised penises. (Very slight.) I got used to it because all of my prior male partners were circumcised, so it wasn't really something I had to think about. Where I live, uncut guys are actually rarer than cut guys, so it's not really like my preference shrinks my dating pool at all. (Also I'm primarily interested in women, so if my SO drops dead tomorrow, I probably won't have to think about it that much.) My SO is cut, and it's not like I can go back in time and change that, so hey - if I enjoy having sex with my man slightly more because he's cut, why is that anyone else's business? 

It's still a **massive** human rights issue, and I actively campaign against it (my Jewish family is so mad at me for that), but I think we've grown desensitized to it because we're used to it. It's normal for us. Some of us treat it like a personal appearance preference.

(You did ask ""why,"" so that's my answer. It's also why I believe Female Circumcision is so accepted in other cultures; they view it as normal, therefore it is to them, and we have to fight that attitude at its core rather than demonize it.)"
43,duodczc,"&gt;There’s 9 million people in London. 172,000 of that population is Jewish. To put this on the Jewish community is borderline scapegoating.

Were literally talking about something that, as far as i know, that vast majority of Jewish people get done for religious reasons.I didn't 'put it on them' like you said, its literally something that Jewish people do, putting some of this statistic on them isn't scapegoating, its literally what they do. Or are you one of these people who sees anyone mention Jewish people must be antisemitic and scapegoating them? I mean if you don't believe me then that's fine but [maybe read up on this first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brit_milah) before accusing me of targeting them.

&gt; Isn’t the US population in England much more progressive than the backwards evangelical population in the Deep South.

Circumcision isnt just a religious thing in America, read up on it, its actually really weird how normalised it is over there to just get it done.

&gt;The combined Jewish and US population in London is about 250,000. So that can’t be true even if every Jew and Yank in London supported it

It's like your ignoring the last part of my single line reply. I shall post it again so you can be sure to read it.

&gt;generally lots of religious types that are in to circumcision.

Not to mention there are people who simply get it done because their parents did it to them."
44,duegjey,"&gt; I looked at what you said. People who do this cannot be good or loving parents. Jews do this, therefore they cannot be good or loving parents.

You are purposefully extending the scope of what i said to misrepresent me. I did not say all Jews are not good, there are those who do not circumcise their children. I don't know the percentage and quite frankly i don't care.

The point stands, if you cause harm to your child because of your religion, you are not a good person. 

Also, circumcision is a risk, that sometimes results in death: http://www.cirp.org/library/death/

The jewish law actually has provision for that, in case 3 or more male babies die due to circumcision, the parents are free to not circumcise the 4th at the 8th day after birth. 

http://www.cirp.org/library/cultural/neusner1/

Edit: Also, there is another part that needs to be looked at: 
http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4391-circumcision

&gt; Unlike Christian baptism, circumcision, however important it may be, is not a sacrament which gives the Jew his religious character as a Jew. An uncircumcised Jew is a full Jew by birth (Ḥul. 4b; 'Ab. Zarah 27a; Shulḥan 'Aruk, Yoreh De'ah, 264, 1).

So a baby to a Jewish family is a Jew, even when not circumcised. There isn't even any repercussion if a baby is not circumcised in the eyes of the Jewish religion. So it only a practice that is supported but no required."
45,dtm1goj,"I would agreee with you that the hardest position would be for a Jewish person on this topic. 

First, Objectively circumcision does have health detriments. It damages the penis in the following ways:

- It removes thousands of fine-touch nerve cells
- When done in infancy it ablates the frenulum
- It removes the sensitive ridged band
- It eliminates the natural gliding action of the penis
- It leaves a permanent scar
- It dries out the mucosa of the glans
- It causes keratinization of the glans
- It causes a narrowing of the urethral opening.

The reason that circumcision is so valuable to the Jewish community is because people value a social group more when they have to pay a high price for entry. This is why people value country clubs with high dues. It's why hazing cements social bonds in a fraternity. So in this case circumcision is a high social cost paid publicly with a ceremony that helps bind people to the group. It's worked well for thousands of years. The question you would have to ask yourself is whether you find it ethical to make that sacrifice for your son without his consent. "
46,dtm29ow,"&gt;The reason that circumcision is so valuable to the Jewish community is because people value a social group more when they have to pay a high price for entry.

I appreciate where you're coming from, but I think you're being a bit patronizing there. Your responses above are factually accurate (the foreskin certainly contain thousands of nerves), but as a man who has examined a fair amount of cut and uncut penises and uh, manipulated them, I haven't noticed horrifying scars or noticeable differences in enjoyment of sex between my cut and uncut partners.

Most folks taking up a hard line anti-circumcision position (as you appear to) mention the fairly obvious point that the foreskin is a body part containing nerves and glide past whether circumcision actually affects sexual performance or enjoyment; the consensus among the scientific community is that it does not, and a [real awful lot of data supports that conclusion.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23937309/?i=6&amp;from=/16037710/related).

Of course, this could be a result of systematic and pervasive cultural bias among academics, but a bit of critical thinking suggests that it isn't; while Jews practice infant circumcision, the bulk of Sub Sarahan Africa (along with the Babylonians and most ancient Semitic cultures) practice(d) circumcision well into or after puberty, meaning that most of those circumcised would be quite capable of telling if it had a significant negative effect on their sexual experiences.

Therefore the most reasonable conclusion is precisely the one that I've made: circumcision is an unnecessary medical procedure with a low likelihood of being particularly helpful and a low likelihood of being particularly harmful. It has a high level of cultural significance for my people, but is fundamentally unnecessary, and is a choice I'd be making that would permanently affect my child, which I or they would be unable to take back.

Isn't that enough to make it a dilemma?"
47,dtqpbkp,"Sorry for the delayed response.

I never argued that circumcision isn’t damaging. I realize now that I ignored some important parts of your previous post, specifically the portion where you ask for data on sexual dysfunction. To that end, [here’s a survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/21672947/) whose findings suggest that circumcised men and their partners do experience some of the symptoms you mentioned. The relevant portion of the abstract:

&gt; Circumcision was associated with frequent orgasm difficulties in Danish men and with a range of frequent sexual difficulties in women, notably orgasm difficulties, dyspareunia and a sense of incomplete sexual needs fulfilment. Thorough examination of these matters in areas where male circumcision is more common is warranted.

I can think of a few other studies that might address your concerns and would be happy to edit in some links for you. More to the point, though, the foreskin and frenulum’s (which are both removed in part or whole during infant circumcision) value ought to be self-evident to anyone who’s ever interacted with or read about them. They receive pleasurable sensation, protect and maintain the sensitivity of the glans, and provide biomechanical lubrication during masturbation and sex (as well as reducing friction around the point of entry during penetration). There’s plenty of documentation online that demonstrates the foreskin and frenulum’s ability to contribute to orgasm, for instance, and you could probably even ask an uncircumcised man with normal, retractile foreskin if it feels good to touch any of the tissue that circumcision removes.

So does circumcision produce some loss of function? Yes, the foreskin has sensory and biomechanical properties that are completely absent after circumcision.

Do circumcised men perceive this loss of function? Not unless they have an uncircumcised partner or they live in a place that makes full information on the foreskin readily available.

Do the men who do perceive this loss of function think of circumcision as overall harmful? If they do not have severe phimosis and circumcision holds no ritual/aesthetic value to them, then probably yes. If they’re a Jewish convert, though, they might realize what they’ll lose to the procedure and still decide that it’s worth going through because inclusion in the Jewish community is more important.

In the US, circumcision is presented as a prophylactic procedure so objectively harmless that it can be performed via surrogate consent. My point is that the only reason Americans are comfortable performing circumcision without direct consent is because they systematically ignore the fact that the foreskin does have certain functions, and that the value of these functions to any individual’s sexual experience can only be assessed by the individual in question. This means that whether or not circumcision’s proposed prophylactic benefits outweigh its risk of procedural complications and its definite functional losses can only be accurately determined on a case-by-case basis by seeking the input of the person who is to undergo the procedure himself."
48,dubfnlb,"Circumcision, though which one was brought into the Jewish community, is explicitly superceded by baptism, through which one is brought into the Church."
49,dp7wr3d,"From the LBD


The Halachic (Jewish legal) definition of a Jew is one who is born of a Jewish mother or has converted according to the Halacha, that is to say, in a way consistent with the requirements of Jewish law. Judaism is not a proselytising religion in that it does not actively seek to convert non-Jews to the faith. Nevertheless, Judaism is accepting of any person who sincerely wishes to belong to the Jewish people. By definition, conversion entails a commitment to a fully observant and practising Jewish life style. Throughout the ages, people have converted to Judaism. Some of these converts have made a significant contribution to the Jewish people. Once a person is converted, he is considered fully Jewish in every respect. The Beth Din is invested by Jewish law with the authority and responsibility to judge objectively, the sincerity and suitability of our applicants. In doing so, its concern is not just to maintain standards of Jewish law and to be the guardian of Jewish status but to ensure that it is acting in a way that is best for the applicant. Changing one’s faith, in particular when it involves taking on the stringent standards of Jewish observance, is a huge undertaking. It should not be pursued because of some idealised notion of what it means to be a Jew, as a gesture of personal sacrifice for the sake of love, or in the expectation that it will resolve a mental or emotional anguish. Indeed, there should be no ulterior motive other than the genuine desire to join the Jewish people and its destiny.

Quite apart from the fact that conversion for ulterior motives is Halachically flawed, conversion for the wrong reasons can also lead to deep personal unhappiness and inner conflict. The London Beth Din will sympathetically consider an application for conversion from any person who sincerely wishes to be a Jew or Jewess. While it does not condone inter-faith marriages for Jews, it will also consider applications from non-Jews who are in a relationship with or are civilly married to a Jewish person. However, the condition for accepting any such person for conversion, is that the Beth Din must be satisfied, that the applicant wishes to convert to Judaism for the sake of Judaism and would follow its path even if the relationship were to break down.

Required Standards of Observance
Conversion by definition involves a commitment to observe all Mitzvot. It also includes matters of Jewish belief and practice. The Beth Din expects a convert to maintain the standard of observance required by Jewish law, of every Jewish person. This includes (but is not restricted to) Shabbat (Sabbath) observance, maintaining kashrut (Jewish dietary laws) both in and outside one’s home and observing the laws relating to Jewish marriage and family purity. There is an expectation that the convert will be able to read Hebrew, follow a Synagogue service, know how our festivals are celebrated and observed and be familiar with the Halachic (Jewish legal) and moral principles required to run an observant Jewish home. Similarly, it is expected that the convert will belong to a synagogue and participate in community life. Most applicants do not meet these criteria when they initially approach the Beth Din. The process of conversion is intended to give applicants an opportunity to explore Judaism in depth to the point where they (and their Jewish partners where applicable) will feel willing and comfortable, over a period of time, to adapt to an observant Jewish life style.

The Beth Din is aware, that the standards it requires for conversion create an anomaly insofar as converts are expected to be more religiously observant than the majority of the mainstream Jewish community, who tend to be more traditional than observant. While the lapse in religious standards within the wider Jewish community is a problem in its own right, affected to a large extent by the overwhelming secular society in which most Western Jews live, it cannot be a reason for lowering the universal standard expected of every Jew by the Torah (Bible) for one who wishes to enter the Jewish faith.

Conversion Process

While there is some flexibility in the conversion process depending on specific circumstances it would generally take the following form:

1. Prior to making a formal application for conversion, it would normally be expected that the potential convert would discuss his/her desire to convert with a local orthodox Rabbi, with a view to learning about the conversion process and what it entails. After meeting the Rabbi, the applicant should ask the Rabbi to write a letter of recommendation which should be sent to the Beth Din together with the potential convert’s initial letter which is referred to in the next paragraph.

2. A potential convert should initiate the formal process of conversion by writing a letter to the Beth Din describing their background and family and explaining why they have an interest in converting to Judaism. They should set out in the letter, any experience that they have had hitherto, of Jewish practice and custom. If the applicant is civilly married to a Jewish person or even if he/she is in a relationship with a Jewish person, it is important to mention this in the initial letter.

3. The Beth Din will make an initial assessment of the candidate’s suitability for conversion, based on the contents of the letter. If it is apparent that the applicant (and partner where applicable) have not yet discussed their situation with a Rabbi, the Beth Din may refer them to a Rabbi who is familiar with the conversion process and with whom the applicant can have an informal discussion. 

4. Where it is apparent from the letter of application and any supporting documentation, that the criteria for conversion applications can be met, the Beth Din will ordinarily send the applicant a formal application form for completion and on receipt of the completed form, the Beth Din will normally invite the applicant (and partner where applicable) to an interview.

Should the interviewing Dayan/Dayanim determine on the basis of the interview, that the applicant should be allowed to proceed with the conversion process, the Beth Din will usually suggest a reading list and syllabus to enable the applicant to learn more about the Jewish faith and will advise the candidate how he or she can become more involved in Jewish communal life. The applicant will also be invited, after suitable reflection, to seek a further interview should they still wish to proceed.

5. At the second meeting (and in certain limited circumstances, even at the first meeting) the Beth Din will ordinarily recommend that the applicant should begin a course of study with a private teacher drawn from the Beth Din’s pool of experienced teachers. In a case where the applicant is involved with a Jewish party, it is the Jewish party who will initially be given a tutor and the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to orthodox religious practice. The appointed teachers are the same gender as the applicant and will be asked to follow the Beth Din’s conversion syllabus. 

6. Once tuition has commenced, the Beth Din will meet with the applicant (and partner where applicable) at regular intervals (usually six monthly) in order to review their progress. Prior to any meeting with the Beth Din, the Beth Din will require the tutor to provide a progress report.

7. The Beth Din will expect the applicant to be living in a community that has a viable and vibrant orthodox Jewish infrastructure (including access to Jewish learning) where orthodox Jewish practice can be observed at first hand. This is usually a pre-condition to proceeding with a conversion application.

8. At some stage in the process, the Beth Din will require the convert to live with a Jewish family (approved by the Beth Din) normally for a period of at least six months. This will enable the convert to experience practical Judaism from within a Jewish home.

9. The process is irrevocably completed with a convert immersing themselves in a mikvah (ritual bath) and in the case of a man (prior to that) undergoing circumcision.

Terminating the Conversion Process
Having started the conversion process, a convert is not obliged to complete it and can end the process at any time. By the same token, the Beth Din may at any time, withdraw the applicant from the conversion process, should it take the view that the conversion would not be viable.

The Key Criteria For Conversion
The Beth Din looks for four criteria to be in place before they will finalise the conversion:-

1. Knowledge of Jewish laws and customs relating to daily life and festivals.

2. Consistent, practical observance of Jewish law and principles in daily life.

3. Direct, lived experience of Jewish community.

4.   An inward readiness to take on responsibilities of being a Jew or Jewess.

The last of these is the most difficult for the Beth Din to assess as it is a matter of the heart. While the first three criteria provide some evidence of the fourth, it is nevertheless not possible to know with certainty. The Beth Din will not finalise a conversion until it is reasonably satisfied that the candidate has in his or her heart of hearts resolved to commit to an orthodox Jewish life.

Time
Most conversions are completed within two or three years. However, each case is unique and the particular circumstances of each case are taken into account by the Beth Din. "
50,dps0rtj,"No MRA would say you can't have a circumcision if you want one—so long as you're 18, go right ahead. 

But if you want to cut up your son's penis? No, fuck you, that's not your right to do. 

And, FYI, the reform Jewish community is rapidly moving towards no longer supporting circumcision, so get used to being in the minority in the coming decades. This is a ""no brainer"" human rights violation, and if you have difficulty with that concept, that *is* your problem. 

And I say all this as a circumcised man myself. No problems because of it at all—but I still recognize that it shouldn't have been done to me without my informed consent. "
51,dnavuvw,"There's a discussion here for banning male circumcision on people under 12. The Jewish community is like wtf, they'd have to abandon the religion right then and there.

Didn't know US Christians do it as well though.

52,di8w6ed,"Read what I wrote.

I said that circumcision is more sanitary than getting your *ears* pierced. This is undeniably true in the long term. FGM is more akin to getting your ears pierced for health consequences than circumcision. FGM incurs long term health risks. Ear piercings get infected all the time as well. (I know this girl who has had a ongoing and recurring belly button infection since she was 16.)

This is all thinly veiled hate speech masquerading as concern for children.

Again, circumcision in the Jewish community is eventually self-correcting in the long term in Western societies. I've already mentioned before in this thread that I know a Jewish toddler whose parents did not snip snip.

There are two conflicting concerns here. Whether it is more important to allow people to use this as an excuse to amplify and spread their hatred of Jews and a relatively stupid but long term benign practice of circumcision."

You are right that the Jewish community is starting to question such practice, but it is still quite small.

55,dio1tcq,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Just a few weeks ago she was a shy, bookish high school student from a small town in the Indonesian province of East Java who liked to raid her local library and pull books randomly from the shelves.

But last week the head-scarf-wearing student, Asa Firda Inayah, 18, was standing on the stage of “Rosi,” a prominent national talk show, reciting one of her many famous Facebook posts on the importance of pluralism, as inspirational violin music played in the background.

“By chance I was born in Indonesia to a Muslim family,” Ms. Asa read in a squeaky voice. “If I had been born in Sweden or Israel, to a Christian or Jewish family, is there any guarantee that I would embrace Islam? There isn’t.”

That essay, “Heritage,” and dozens of other writings she has posted to Facebook have made her an instant celebrity in Muslim-majority Indonesia, which is still torn over the blasphemy conviction of Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the Christian governor of Jakarta, the capital, who was removed from his post and put in jail last month.

Ms. Asa’s sudden fame led to a meeting last week with President Joko Widodo and a speaking engagement at a prestigious university. She also appeared on numerous news and talk show programs to explain the importance of religious tolerance.

But there was a flip side to the fame: Islamic hard-liners reportedly began calling her home in the middle of the night, threatening to kill her. She is now being protected by a local moderate Muslim militia.

The local news media has even compared her to Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager and advocate of women’s education who was shot in the head by the Taliban.

“Thank God there is still a young generation like Afi,” Joko Anwar, a prominent film director, said in a Twitter post, referring to Ms. Asa by her nickname.

But even before her meeting with the president was scheduled, reports had begun to emerge that the feel-good story of Ms. Asa was not what it appeared, and that she had plagiarized popular posts from other social media users’ accounts.

When questioned by reporters, Ms. Asa at first brushed off the allegations, calling them a “private matter” and saying she had little recollection of the Facebook account from which she had apparently lifted one of her most famous posts to the social network. Two days later she acknowledged in a Facebook post that she had plagiarized, writing, “We all have. Who hasn’t done that?”

Hard-line Islamist websites seized on the news. The Islamic Defender’s Front, a hard-line organization that campaigned to have Mr. Basuki, the former governor, arrested on blasphemy charges, said in a Facebook post that Ms. Asa and the governor shared similar faults.

“It’s exactly like Ahok who won’t ever admit he’s wrong,” the post said, referring to Mr. Basuki by his nickname.

A Facebook account bearing the name Mita Handayani, which Ms. Asa had been accused of plagiarizing from, said on social media that she had no problem with Ms. Asa’s using her writing. Ms. Mita added that she thought Ms. Asa was merely being targeted for her religious tolerance.

The lightning rise and potential fall of the East Javanese teenager has led Indonesians to reflect on why they had elevated a small-town high school student to the status of national hero so quickly. And it ignited an online debate in Indonesia about how serious the offense of plagiarism was, and whether it should be forgiven.

Pradewi Tri Chatami, 30, a recent college graduate, posted on Facebook that the recent triumph of hard-line Islamic groups in Jakarta meant that progressive Indonesians were looking for anyone willing to stand up for pluralism.

“It’s a scramble to find an icon,” Ms. Pradewi said in a telephone interview. “I liked her because she was a sophisticated young woman who was brave enough to share her thoughts. But to idolize someone is ultimately to sacrifice them.”

Social media is extremely popular among middle-class Indonesians, drawing an estimated 80 million users to sites like Facebook and Twitter in this country of about 250 million.

Ross Tapsell, a researcher on the Indonesian media at Australian National University, said middle-class Indonesians regularly made folk heroes out of less-advantaged Indonesians they discovered on social media, only to be disappointed later.

He cited the example of an older satay seller who was hailed as a stoic hero by social media users for continuing to sell grilled beef after terrorists launched a grenade attack near his stand in Jakarta in last year.

But when journalists eventually interviewed the newly legendary satay seller, he said the reason he kept selling his beef after the attack was that if he abandoned his stand it might have been stolen.

“His reaction actually told us about poverty,” Mr. Tapsell said.

Similarly, he said, many Indonesians put Ms. Asa “on a pedestal” and were disappointed when she turned out to be less perfect than they had imagined.

“The middle class has only themselves to blame for making out this 18-year-old from Banyuwangi something she wasn’t,” he said, referring to Ms. Asa’s hometown.

Ms. Asa did not respond to calls or Facebook messages seeking comment.

Savic Ali, a progressive Muslim activist who runs websites for Nahdlatul Ulama, the nation’s largest Muslim organization, said that when he met Ms. Asa in Banyuwangi, she had struck him as a fairly typical teenager, one who preferred listening to her headphones over conversation.

He said he was impressed that Ms. Asa had the bravery to post the things she did, even if not all the words were necessarily hers originally.

“The majority of people aren’t brave enough to raise their voices even though they actually disagree with the views of hard-liners,” he said. “Meanwhile here’s this teenager who feels no such burden.”"
56,erxhi72,"WHEN did he become a sports fan? And how many times is he going to play that ""xxx was my greatest escape as a lonely kid"" thing? He's done that over and over and over and I've stopped typing during interviews and often thought, ""wait. When did he like THAT band or THAT thing? I don't remember hearing that before."" And the whole thing about being such a tortured teenager is a load of complete BULLSHIT. Stern went to BU. I dreamed of going to college in Boston from south Mississippi. The idea of going to school in Boston was a dream for kids where I was from, even if it doesn't mean much to those who grew up on the East Coast. Your parents were far from broke if you went to BU or any Boston college or university. He also, notably has a best friend since childhood. He had friends, he DID get around girls from time to time. His family went on vacations, they moved when their spoiled son nagged them about getting out of the black neighborhood, (in one breath he talks about all the neighbors moving out and how horrible they were, and in the other tells his story about his parents looking for a new house in a better neighborhood.). His childhood was not lonely. It was filled with records and pot and hanging out with whatever smattering of losers he hung out with. The myth of Howard Stern as a lonely child is just that. There's a reason you hear nothing about the sister or hear him mention her; she fucking hates him. The family was traditional Jews. Howard was God in that house and got what he wanted. I lived in NYC for many years. A Jewish housewife as stereotypical as Ray Stern, there's no way she didn't want to get the hell out of that neighborhood. She may have quipped ONE time, about ONE neighbor moving at night. But maybe those neighbors were rent-skippers. Who knows. But this thing about Howard being so lonely and coming from this super progressive, black-people-loving Jewish family is complete sewage. And that's how he began losing me. It was great when he was just Howard. But now he's so p/c, so indoctrinated as a ""changed"" man and SJW, yet he really is too stupid to realize most of his fans remember who he was before he became an elitist, entitled white celebrity."
57,dnivszx,"All right, time to design the waifu. 

**What does she look like?** The age part is a bit silly as she'll be growing up from teenage years with me. As for the rest, well, she's probably going to look similar in body to me as I based my choices there on my ideal woman (not knowing I'd be designing a waifu in turn down the road). Let's say...busty in the bust size (one rank above me), a big butt, feminine hips/thighs, standard size in height, fair skin color (I considered brown but given I want blonde hair it wouldn't work), healthy chubbiness, waifish fitness. Long, blonde, silky hair. As for eye color...let's say...bright green. She generally has a rather aristocratic bearing. 

**How does she try to deal with interpersonal conflict?** Let's say...aggressively logical. She keeps a clear head in terms of how she reaches conclusions and ideas, but once she has she's very forward and unyielding about it. Almost imperious. 

**How was her family life/what is her personal history?** I'm going to say...she's a scion of an old Virginia planter aristocratic family, one of the few that got through the Civil War with its wealth intact and adjusted well to the new order. Very old wealth, and she has a pleasant aristocratic southern drawl to go with it. We both go to an elite school, after all, but my jewish family is probably new wealth compared to her old. She was kind of spoiled sweet, and though the parents are probably going to be a little disappointed she won't be giving grandkids, she has two brothers that will give those and will carry on the family name to boot. Actually, let's say she's a Jefferson, given I'm a huge Jefferson fanboy. Her name will be...Melody Jefferson. Come to think of it, what will my name be? My name is both very anglo-saxon and very male--can't exactly feminize it. Ah, well, it's not too important. Anyway, I figure she's very aware of her own sexuality and is the driving force in getting me out of the closet. 

**What are her plans?** We'll say...she's a lover of the south. She wants to see it rise again--but not in the Civil War sense or any racist sense at all. She wants to see it become an economic powerhouse of the US, rather than the still-struggling backwoods it kind of is. To that end, we'll say she's a libertarian like me--though she's kind of an anarcho-monarchist in Tolkien's vein, we'll say--and wants to use a freeing up of the south's markets to do so. More personally, she wants to be a respected local figure in her area, run a nice little business and make good money, and work against the anti-homosexuality in her culture. Also probably wants to adopt a few kids or at least be the cool aunt to any nieces/nephews. 

**What are her hobbies and general interests?** History, particularly medieval french and American history, playing war games and economic sims of various kinds. She's the sort to consider Civilization games fun but a bit too normie. Very fond of the older Paradox games before they got too casual for her tastes. Loves to play France or, if she can't get her hands on the big blue blob/won't for the sake of not steamrolling, Poland or some celtic country. Very fond of chocolate ice cream--it's one of the few cheats she'll take in an otherwise strict diet. She loves telling stories and creating characters, and can fabricate quick fairy tales on the fly. She definitely wants to write books. She's also very philosophical and interested in the metaphysical, though she's not really religious for obvious reasons. Has an intense curiosity about how people around her think, the ways they think, and what they may be thinking at any point in time--very prone to just ask out of the blue what someone is thinking about. Also finds politics invigorating if pointless in her eyes, as her esoteric views aren't exactly represented anywhere, even in the libertarian party. 

**What is her specific sexuality? What does she like in a girl? Any fetishes?** She's very much gay; while she can find aesthetic enjoyment in men she never feels around them the way she feels around women. Being around beautiful women just makes her want to...*claim* them. She's very much the more forward one of our relationship and is, in fact, one of those ""patrician facesitting fetishists."" She's a gentle and loving dom. She loves teacher-student stuff too, and being the loving-but-strict teacher in particular. Beyond that, I'll leave to chance what her other fetishes might be. It'll be an adventure to discover them. 

**What's her taste in popular media?** ...I guess, despite specifically being told not to, I *did* kinda answer this too much in the general hobbies question. Welp. To add to it, she loves black-and-white Charlie Chaplin comedies and other slapstick humor. Doesn't watch much television at all--finds most of it boring drivel--but reads a good bit of fiction and nonfiction. She considers knowledge of the classics to be of the utmost importance, and will learn as she grows up both ancient greek and latin. 

**How does she feel about romance? And how does she show her love?** She's very much a monogamous sort, for starters, but that's obvious. As for the rest, if anything, she's the princess charming to sweep me off of my feet. She takes her time figuring out and deciding that she's in love--we can't pass on that juicy UST, after all--but once she does, she moves forward seductively and lovingly. She's very touchy-feely, and while she likes being alone at times she often, even if she doesn't feel like doing anything with me, just wants to be near me or touching me with shoulders together or the like. Very fond of giving and receiving massages. Also, the whole loving dom thing does kind of bleed through to regular life. 

**Does she hold any intense morals, beliefs, or philosophies?** Well...I've kind of answered this question in the previous ones. To add to it, though, let's say she's a Jeffersonian Deist in terms of beliefs in the supernatural. That seems like it'd interact interestingly with my own antitheist atheism. Also, she has a very strict code of chivalrous honor, and abhors all playing dirty/cheating, as well as lying. She never lies, or so she says. Her word is her bond. On the downside, she's kind of inflexible about some things.

**What one thing could someone do to really melt her heart?** Hmm... Here's an idea I had from one friend's character who would do this (and who would melt the heart of HER lovers): if I take her hand, put her palm on my cheek, and rub my cheek affectionately against her hand while smiling sweetly. That'd probably kill her. "

Fair enough.

&gt; Oh look, the super convincing ""I definitely have black friends"" type of argument ... I guess long as your 'friends' are okay with it

1. I wasn't exactly making a ""I have black friends"" argument, actually, but instead a ""I've been around Jewish people and they don't tend to be as thin-skinned and humorless are you are"" argument. Besides that, the merits of one's argument are not uplifted by their friend group, unless the person they're arguing to is vain and idiotic, I guess.

2. Why is it so difficult to believe that I have Jewish friends? Is it because I don't infantilize them like you do? Typical progressives with their racism of low expectations.

&gt; Me calling out anti-Semitic caricatures that have been used heavily in the past and even to this day to belittle and devalue the Jewish community is somehow more offensive to you than the caricature itself?

Okay, how about you describe what exactly is ""offensive"" and ""caricature"" about the above image? I see no caricature here whatsoever, just a curly-haired fish with a kippah. News flash: practicing Orthodox Jews do, in fact, wear kippahs, and drawing a Jew wearing a kippah is not a caricature but instead a description of reality. Another news flash: Ashkenazim tend to have dense, curly red or brunette hair, so, again, drawing a Jew with curly red hair is not a caricature, it's an anatomically accurate image.

Why don't you tell me why you don't feel that your emotionalizing, small-minded way of accusing random people whom you have zero way of knowing their intentions or inner convictions of being *fascistic* is not polluting our civil discourse on the topic of race? Can you explain to me how you're helping Jews by labeling literally any depiction of a Jew in media as a caricature and labeling any person who deigns to draw a Jew a fascist?"

RACIST MEXICAN TV SHOW

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8gkKlqor4  

Edit: Segregation is alive and well in Mexico in many ways. 

''“We have a double identity. We are Mexicans as well as Jews,” says Emilio Betech, who, along with Enrique Chmelnik and Ricardo Silva, hosts “El Aleph,” a weekly radio show about Jewish culture broadcast on Radio Red. He estimates that about 90 percent of his 30,000 listeners are non-Jewish. “There’s a general sense that the Jewish community is very closed, meaning hermetic, meaning not open to the rest, which in some aspects might be true,” he says. To be sure, the community has one of the lowest assimilation rates in the world: more than 85 percent of Mexican Jews marry other Jews, compared to less than 50 percent in Europe and the US. More than 90 percent of Mexican Jewish children attend Jewish schools, another statistic to make the rabbinates of other Diaspora communities drool. Growing up in Mexico City, Betech says his social circle was almost exclusively Jewish, as was the case for many Jews I spoke to. His program receives calls from listeners wanting to know about everything from the laws of kashrut (keeping kosher) to whether or not Jews are allowed to keep pets. “We found a large amount of the [Mexican] population who never had the opportunity to speak to Jewish people. There’s a lot of curiosity. They seem to be very interested in religious practices, though that’s not really our program’s focus. They find them exotic.”

“Jews are seen as an elite,” says Karina Morales Martinez, a Spanish teacher who lives in Colonia Roma, which like Condesa was once a largely Jewish neighborhood. “It’s a bit malinchista,” she continues, referring to a Mexican tendency to revere outsiders, “but many Mexicans want to be Jewish because they’re seen as foreigners. The classic idea of a Jew in Mexico is of someone blonde with blue eyes.” Indeed, compared to many Mexicans, Jews are fair-skinned, and some who came from places like Turkey or Spain had red hair and blue eyes, while many who arrived from Russia or the Ukraine were blonde, a reversal of the traditional racial (and racist) stereotype of Jewish people having dark skin, dark eyes, and large noses. Several people I spoke to commented that the Jews have probably benefited from the stratification of Mexican society along lines of class and race, prejudices the Jewish community itself is often accused of reinforcing, though no one wanted to be quoted as saying so. Several times a source, alluding to an unspoken rule that Jews never speak badly of fellow Jews to the “outside world,” leaned forward to whisper, “The Jewish community is very elitist, but please don’t put that. I’m only telling you this because you’re Jewish.”

60,e8nxgoy,"About why they 'arent white' part, its not that they are not white, its that they are Jewish. Same thing would happen if you hada white Muslim you'd still be white but to them you would be Muslim. As to why the hate, well its a bit more complicated.

This part i can only speak from experience so take everything with a grain of salt. The majority of people aren't in contact with Jews until later in life, atleast where i live so the stereotype is almost all you have to go off of(this isn't helped by the fact that the Jewish community is very closed off in general, you'd need to be a good friend to be invited to a bar mitzvah).

As to why the historical hate, well part of it is real part is fake. First the real part, historically jews were the first bankers and money lenders because Catholicism banned money lending as it was considered usury(this changed later on). Back in those days you didnt want jews in your country because they were a different religeon but you did want their money so compromise was struck, they could stay in your country but necer truly be welcome.

To combat this harshness Judaism generated a sort of pact,( the specific Hebrew word eludes me rn) in which you would always try to help a person from your community before another. This meant that the Jewish managed ti get a 'strong' (this is relative) hold on their economy, this generated resentment from lower clases who had now a disadvantage in finding jobs or selling goods for not being Jewish.

The fake part is the massive propaganda machine of just a bit before the great wars era. People got mad about anything and wanted someone to blame, jews were disliked already so why not add another crime to the rep sheet right?. Then nazis happened and jews flocked all around the globe as immigrants. And by doing this exacerbated all the previous points( think how rednecks hate immigrants because they took er jerbs)

So there, thats what atleast i think is the reason behind Jewish hate."
61,dwcdmp8,"Small dispersed religious minority who generally stick to themselves. They where the perfect scape goats, no one was going to defend them and they where not nearly numerous enough to defend themselves. 

On top of that their religion did not forbid money lending, so in medieval Europe if you wanted a loan you did not have many choices. Expelling the local jewish community is a great way to get rid of some debt you don't want to pay.

edit: As pointed out by u/GKinslayer jews where also forbidden from owning land or joining guilds, forcing them into undesired professions."
62,f0lqg9y,"But America has had populism in the past and it didn’t end in the annihilation of communities. There were race riots in Oklahoma City, but there wasn’t a mass massacre of African Americans. 
Also, in regards to being frugal, My grandfather was a millionaire who drove a station wagon. He was born on a small farm in Indiana. Seems the Anglo American population was interested in education and frugality. 
But at the end of the day, don’t we need trash men and farmers? You say that the Jewish community is interested in success, but isn’t it more that their interested in prestige? A guy getting married and having a family and a wonderful life in rural Kentucky can be considered quite a success, but there’s not exactly prestige to be found. 
It just seems natural that a minority that considers itself both better and special will engender a certain amount of resentment, especially when over represented in positions of power. It’s not that I’m saying the Jewish community isn’t correct in their values, shit, I like to argue with people and talk about ideas, thus they’re quite fun for me. It’s just that - in the American context - I think there is a level of hypocrisy in the community to claim a special status. Also, you can then see them giving each other a hand in career advancement. I won’t get into examples of this that I’ve witnessed or heard of. 
Finally, Jews in the Ottoman Empire and Ethiopia weren’t producing anything as far as culture or science. It would seem to me that the Jewish superiorists that I’ve known never seem to take that into account. Einstein was who he was because he was Austrian. If he’d been born and raised in Ethiopia I doubt he’d have produced very much. 
And the Enlightenment... well, the goys seemed to do just fine. It’s not like Spinoza was essential to any major part of it. Sorry, here. I’m just rehashing an old argument with an acquaintance."

&gt;M""T Hilchos Ishus 1:4, Hilchos Naara Besulah 2:17
&gt;
&gt;S""A Even HaEzer 26:1, 177:5

Ok, good sources, but you don't seem to realize they actually hurt your argument.

Mishne Torah Hilchot Ishut 1:4 
&gt;Before the Torah was given, when a man would meet a woman in the marketplace, and he and she desired, he could give her payment, engage in relations with her wherever they desired, and then depart. Such a woman is referred to as a harlot.3
&gt;
&gt;When the Torah was given, [relations with] a harlot became forbidden, as [Deuteronomy 23:18] states: ""There shall not be a harlot among the children of Israel.""4Therefore, a person who has relations with a woman for the sake of lust, without kiddushin, receives lashes as prescribed by the Torah, because he had relations with a harlot.

This is for all sex outside of marriage, and it i don't remember if this even applies to girl who has not reached puberty. 

Mishne Torah Hilchot Na'ara Betula 2:17
&gt;I maintain that [the intent of] the Torah's statement [Leviticus 19:29], ""Do not defile your daughter to have her play the harlot,"" is that a father should not say: ""Since the obligation of the Torah for a seducer or a rapist was solely that he should give the father money, I will hire my virgin daughter to someone to have relations with her for whatever price I desire, or I will allow him to have relations for her without charge. For a man has the right to forgo monetary rights to him to any person he desires."" To counter such thoughts, it is written: ""Do not defile your daughter.""
&gt;
&gt;The Torah obligates a rapist and a seducer to pay money rather than be punished by lashes when the matter happened by chance, without the knowledge of [the girl's] father, and she did not ready herself for [the relations]. For this is an extraordinary and uncommon matter.
&gt;
&gt;If, however, a person leaves his virgin daughter accessible for anyone to engage in relations with her, this will cause the entire earth to be filled with sexual immorality.            
For [ultimately], a father will marry his daughter and a brother his sister, [for in a sexually permissive society] a [girl] may become pregnant and give birth without knowing who the child's father is.
&gt;
&gt;When a person has his daughter act in this manner, she is considered to be a harlot, and both the man and the girl who engage in relations should be punished by lashes, as [Deuteronomy 23:18] states: ""There shall not be a harlot.""
&gt;
&gt;[In such an instance,] the man is not required to pay a fine, for the Torah prescribed a fine only in the instance of seduction or rape. When a girl prepares herself [for relations] either on her initiative or on that of her father, she is a harlot. And the prohibition against harlotry applies both with regard to a virgin and a non-virgin.
&gt;
&gt;For this reason our Sages stated that a girl who was reputed to have conducted herself immodestly while young is not entitled to a fine, as we have explained,27 for we can assume that she willingly opened herself to this experience.

This is bad, really bad.         
Not only is it saying that Rape get a fine instead of lashes, but that if the girl was ok with the premarital sex she gets lashes too and the guy doesn't need to pay a fine.          
It doesn't end there, the last part says too ignore accusations of rape if they come from someone who has been promiscuous, the good old ""well she'd a slut anyways she probably wanted it"" argument. 

Shulchan Arukh Even Ha'Ezer 26:1,          
http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Even_HaEzer.26?lang=bi

this also talks about either being allowed to marry, bwing forced to send her away or whipping both parties, man and woman. 

maybe you meant 25:2?
&gt;(2)... He may not have intercourse without her consent, and if she is not interested he should appease her until she is interested... 

and yet, no real consequences if violated. 

**edit**:          
177:5 talks about fines. 

so no serious consequences. 

&gt;Your claims about the community are anecdotal at best, more likely entirely speculative.

No they're not, read NY times article, and read the daas Torah blog, the author of the Blog is Ultra Orthodox and not  nobody. 
&gt;Full acceptance of Orthodox Judaism and halacha is a given. There will not be any discussion to justify or prove the validity of Torah or halacha. My books include Yad Moshe the index to the Igros Moshe of Rav Moshe Feinstein, Yad Yisroel the index to the Mishna Berura of the Chofetz Chaim and Daas Torah an encyclopedia of Jewish Theology. I have recently published 3 volumes on the issue of Child and Domestic Abuse in the Jewish community and a revised 2nd edition of Daas Torah (-available in seforim stores and Amazon).. In recent years I have received guidance from Rav Moshe Sternbuch of the Eidah Charedis. I am a member of the chareidi community in Jerusalem.  [source at bottom of the Linked page](http://daattorah.blogspot.com/?m=1) 

 Also i was a member of the community long enough to know just how bad it is, and it's bad, but worse is that too many of the leaders of the community do, which is to ignore it or help the abuser.        
Just Google it, there's a lot more cases like that. 

&gt;You are right that I should not have assumed antisemitism as your motivation but usually that's where people are coming from when taking Jewish law out of context as you have done here. 

There's nothing to imply anti semitism, only if you think pointing out Judaism's flaws is anti semitic.      
And i know a lot of Jews are very sensitive about that and see almost anything critical of Judaism as anti-semitism.      

Judaism, like any other religion, is man made and therefore flawed and mostly relevant to the time it was created.         
The concept of protecting children and young teenagers from sexual abuse through real legal consequences is a modern concept, as i pointed out elsewhere, even a modern country like Spain only raised it's age of consent from 13 very recently.         
It's not a problem unique to Judaism, Christianity and Islam have the same  issues, it's only modern secular law and philosophy that have caused its adherents to this seriously. 

You are seeing my comments as an attack on the community, because they make the community look bad.         
You dismiss my claims as ""anecdotal at best, more likely entirely speculative.""           
This despite me sourcing proof in my main comment, and this is easily further verified with many more cases with a simple Internet search.            
This is real, the Orthodox Jewish community is not special and somehow supernaturally immune from a problem it has never really considered to be that bad, until recently, when modern western laws and morals left them no option.       
And again, not an attack on Judaism specifically, I'm just pointing out the it has serious flaws and it's morality code and laws were more appropriate for a time that has come and passed.          

For what it's worth, please don't dismiss this simply because it's critical of Orthodox Judaism, assuming you're a member of the community, you may have to one day make the decision(hopefully this never happens) to go to local authorities to report someone one day, or hide it/not believe it because it makes the community look bad and you don't believe people in your community act like that.           

I personally knew people who have serious issues and even some who committed suicide because their community didn't believe them/blamed or shunned them and did nothing or even protected their abuser.

I’ve lived and worked in large Jewish communities and this is how their lifestyle is and they are direct and loud. The Jewish community is very close (from my experience) and they will feed you all the time. I would think it’s refreshing for other Jewish girls, who wish to follow those values, to have someone to look to. Her pushing herself on YouTube so much is very forward. 

It’s probably because my home country and town  didn’t have many different cultures and it was fun to learn about the Jewish community. Honestly they were the first nice people to me when I came to America and and very welcoming. I just feel the need to stand up for her."

In the south of Chile there is a feeling against Israeli people more than jews. This has to do with the fact that israeli have gained a game of being awful tourists. People complain that they are loud, rude and dirty. It doesn't help also that an israeli not following our times burned down a national park some years ago.

Sadly the identity of jews is too closely related to the nation of Israel. That government had taken more than questionable measures in many topics, and their citizens (and fellow non israeli jews) have to pay for that, even if they don't agree with it."
67,fehv67i,"Sorry to disappoint all of you but this book is not credible and clearly includes fabrications. For example in other parts of their work they make a claim that Dalai Lama is sympathetic to the Nazis and this is one of the statements they use to support their claim. 

""Yes, it is astonishing why the Jewish Community is so uncritical vis-à-vis the Dalai Lama. On 09.04.03 the Swiss Newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung reported, that the Tibetan religious leader said on a journey in Jerusalem: Hitler would also have the potential of a good man in himself. Hitler was not born as a wicked man, his hatred of the Jewish people made him malicious and this hatred must be battled.  But this doesn’t mean that there was not also lying dormant some Goodness in Hitler. A wicked man can be tomorrow a good man, said the Dalai Lama. For this we have to fight.

Also if such a statement can be interpreted as an expression of Buddhist compassion, it seems tasteless remembering the murdering of six million Jews by the Nazis and the death of millions and millions of war victims on the account of Hitler’s madness. There would be a worldwide protest, if for example the Pope or a Western statesman made such a sympathetic remark on the most prominent mass murderer in human history, especially if such a remark is done in Israel, where many survivors of the Holocaust and their children are living.""

***

You have to ask yourself if this really constitutes a ""sympathetic remark"" toward Hitler by the Dalai Lama. http://www.trimondi.de/EN/interv03.html

Here is another example of this Nazi Tibetan connection by the authors, ""Another concern in America has been the rise of the Neo-Nazi movement.  

Question: I understand that you have since co-authored another bestseller on the influence of Asian religion on the foundational ideology of Adolph Hitler. Evidently, this has unleashed quite a debate in Europe. What’s the cause of the controversy?

Trimondi: In our historical essay “Hitler – Buddha – Krishna – an Unholy Alliance from the Third Reich to Today” we show that the warlike and racist ideas of Heinrich Himmler of the SS and of other well known Neo-fascists have been fundamentally inspired by elements of different Asian religions, such as Vedism, Buddhism, Lamaism and that prominent German Zen Teachers-Dürckheim &amp; Herrigel have been convinced Nazis.""

Yeah some occultists among Nazis that clearly did not include Hitler were vaguely interested in eastern ideas but the idea that Nazi ideas were “fundamentally inspired” by Buddhism and to link Tibetan Buddhism  to the Holocaust in this way is insane. No mainstream historian would ever make such an insane assumption. 

Back in the 90’s the Dalai Lama accepted an invitation from a Japanese group that later turned out be a cult and conducted serin attacks on the Tokya subway system. The Dalai Lama later presented this case to jokingly illustrate that unlike what some of his followers think he is not omniscient. There is no evidence that he knew that this group was anything else than a meditation organization when he visited them and he accepted thousands of different speaking invitations throughout his life to talk about compassion. These authors use this speaking engagement to seeming to blame the Dalai Lama for the crimes of this group and to do this they completely accept the insane ramblings of the founder of this group.

“The mystic history of the AUM sect began in India in 1986. Shoko Asahara had wandered through the southern slopes of the Himalayas for weeks visiting Buddhist monasteries. This journey was supposed to mark the end of years of pilgrimage through the most varied esoteric landscapes: “I tried all kinds of practices such as Taoism, Yoga, Buddhism, incorporating their essence into my training. My goal was supreme spiritual realization and enlightenment. I continued the austere practices with Buddhist texts as my only resort. Finally, I reached my goal in the holy vibration of the Himalayas. I attained supreme realization and enlightenment. […] I also acquired supernatural powers” (Asahara, 1991, vol. 2, p. 13). 

Upon returning to Japan he changed the name of his yoga group and called it AUM Shinrikyo, which means roughly “AUM — Doctrine of the absolute truth”. From this point on, Asahara’s worldview was shaped by the compassionate ethos of Mahayana Buddhism:”

***

What!? How can you cite this at face value? Asahara was a partly blind masseuse from what I recall. How could he really wonder across the world mastering different teachings. To any normal person this is clearly his fictional attempt to connect him with Buddha’s story of doing different practices before awakening and communicating his own dharma. But because the acceptance of this insanity at face value helps them link Dalai Lama with terrorism, they continue unabated in citing him. http://www.trimondi.de/SDLE/Part-2-13.htm

***

“The Japanese would later report the following of his meeting in Dharamsala: “Imagine my delight at being able to meditate with His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, … And in His Holiness’s private meditation room! ‘I’ll sit here where I always sit; you sit there,’ he instructed me. ‘Let me give you a Buddha image.’ … After a few minutes of loud, deep breathing, all traces of the Dalai Lama vanished. He must have completely stopped his breath. At that moment, the astral vision of the golden face of Shakyamuni Buddha radiated from my ajuna chakra. The vision persisted steadily, without a flicker. ‘Ah, this is the Buddha image the Dalai Lama was talking about,’ I thought. I continued my meditation” (Bracket, 1996, p. 68). Smiling, the Dalai Lama then took his leave of him after an intensive exchange of ideas with the following words: “Dear friend, … Look at the Buddhism of Japan today. It has degenerated into ceremonialism and has lost the essential truth of the teachings. … If this situation continues, … Buddhism will vanish from Japan. Something needs to be done” (Kaplan and Marshall, 1996, p. 13). Thereupon the god-king entrusted him with a spiritual mission: “You should spread real Buddhism there [in Japan]. … You can do that well, because you have the mind of a Buddha. If you do so, I shall be very pleased. It will help me with my mission” (Kaplan and Marshall, 1996, p. 13). Asahara was indeed more than happy.”

***

So yeah the Dalai Lama has invited this man into his private residence and meditated with him alone. And then like a jedi master he said that Asahara has a mind of a Buddha, he is the only one who can return real Buddhism to Japan. What a load of shit! Only someone with a passionate hatred for Tibetan Buddhism can be insane enough to believe this drivel. They also cite Kaplan and Marshall instead of Asahara directly as if they were there in the room and not just citing themselves the words of Asahara himself as he used fictional stories about the Dalai Lama to enhance his own image. 

Now I have been typing this for a few hours in a largely futile effort, I am sure. So aside from citing the obvious bias and untrustworthy nature of the authors of this treatise against “Lamaist Tantra”

It is suspicious to read anything about tantra that continually refers to magic even though everything in tantric texts always presentes clear cause and effect explanation.. Or to read an article about tantra that mentions the subtle body only once and doesn’t mention emptiness at all, where as the whole purpose of tantra is to work with subtle energies to induce bliss which is the whole purpose of having a real or imagined partner and then achieve the realization of bliss and emptiness withing the same mind  at the same time thus erasing an all pervasive sense of duality. 

It brings up Tsongkhapa without citation in talking about a partner, omitting that he as a founder of a reformed, strictly monastic school, explicitly advocated not looking for an actual partner and never took up one himself, even in his secret biography. It mentions some position of a grand Sakya abbott who is married, and this post doesn’t exist. There are Sakya patriarchs, the heads of the school who are generally speaking not monastics, but they are not abbots as they are lay people. Then they attribute exploitation of a young girl by this person without any name of this “abbott” or citation or any time period.

You do know there were Jews in Israel prior to 1948...my great great grandfather was a Palestinian Jew during the 1850’s. There is no settling else where, as this home. I forget how little others really understand about the region. You think of there were never any Jews in that region that there would be a Palestinian state, you actually think if all the Israelis left tomorrow a Palestinian State would be declared?!?! Laughing out loud oh boy you have so much learn. Only thing keeping Iran from taking over the region or from it generally imploding is the state of Israel. Jordan had the opportunity to create a Palestinian state in East Jerusalem of all places but they didn’t. 

Some Jews...trust me there are none, 50 Jews in each country doesn’t count. Most of the Moroccan Jews live in France and Israel. I was in Marrakech last year, once a thriving Jewish community is no more. Wikipedia say 3,000 Jews in the Arab World, ya haram! My bar mitzvah had over a 1,000 people/Jews, that’s 30% of the Jews currently in the Arab World and that population isn’t growing.

Egypt - 40 Jews 
Morocco - 2,000 Jews
Yemen like Afghanistan has like 3 Jews

Bibi’s corruption is of no consequence to Israelis, the nation is free and the economy is strong. Can’t say the same about Hamas or the PLO or other Arab Nations. 

“Everyone wants peace”, I wish! You must 18?As Alfred Pennyworth once said, some men just want to watch the world burn. This is Hamas, PLO, and Hezbollah. 

You’ve probably never been to Israel or the Arab World and just talking out of your ass, like half this sub.

Listen up, I know it helps you sleep well at night thinking Israel can’t survive without USA. That was once true but no more. Israel is fine all by herself and if the USA were to ever cut funding we would find another way. The Jewish people are united and will always be there for the state of Israel."

Is Jeremy Corbyn an anti-Semite?

That is the question that has dogged British politics since Mr. Corbyn became the Labour Party leader three years ago. It’s also dominated every Shabbat dinner conversation and the WhatsApp thread of every Jewish family across Britain.

I didn’t want this to be true. Though the Anglo-Jewish community is increasingly Conservative, my Jewish friends and I are almost all Labour voters. That fact makes us close cousins of American Jews, who, [as the saying goes](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/nyregion/milton-himmelfarb-wry-essayist-87-dies.html), earn like Episcopalians but vote like Puerto Ricans.

As Jewish Labourites, we draw inspiration from a tradition that harks back to [the Battle of Cable Street](http://time.com/4516276/cable-street-battle-london-east-end-80-years/) in 1936, when the left turned out in force to defend the Jews from Fascists on the streets of London. We all left university a decade ago dreaming of one day working in Labour politics.

But for the past several months, as scandal upon Jew-hating scandal has washed up at Jeremy Corbyn’s door, our parents and aunts and uncles have insisted that we were being loyal to a party that no longer wanted anything to do with us. Some friends began to [leave Labour](https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/labour-campaigner-resigns-over-antisemitism-1.463070).

Consider the evidence, they told me. Mr. Corbyn has described the constitutionally genocidal Hamas as his “friends.” He’s appeared on stage with inveterate anti-Semites. He’s defended a mural that depicted hooknosed bankers running the world. He’s attended a wreath-laying ceremony that celebrated the perpetrators of the Munich Olympics massacre.

All of this was variously offensive, tone-deaf, ignorant or, at times, insidious. But none of these scandals quite clinched it for me. The associations were often tangential. And, I reasoned, there was the possibility of confusion: Mr. Corbyn is not exactly known for his sharp wits.

Then, last Thursday, The Daily Mail released [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEB9PwKYmmA) of Mr. Corbyn speaking at a 2013 conference in London about Britain’s legacy in Palestine. The conference was promoted by the Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. Other speakers included Stephen Sizer, who has [appeared alongside Holocaust deniers](https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/UK-vicar-attends-Tehran-Zionist-lobby-conference-378226) at a conference in Iran. So far, so familiar.

What Mr. Corbyn said, however, was different. While bemoaning the activities of a group of Zionists, he identified two problems. “One is that they don’t want to study history, and secondly, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all their lives, they don’t understand English irony either,” he said. “I think they need two lessons, which we can help them with.”

There’s been some debate over whether he was berating just that particular group of Zionists or Zionists in general. Mr. Corbyn, in a limp effort at explaining himself, has stated that he “described those pro-Israel activists as Zionists in the accurate political sense, not as a euphemism for the Jewish people.”

 This is, to put it in British, utter tosh.

This was classic anti-Semitism. Here were a group of Jews with whom Mr. Corbyn has a political disagreement. And he smeared them not on the basis of that disagreement but on the basis of their ethnicity. He accused them of failing to assimilate English values, of not fitting in, of still being a bit foreign. Had they been Christian Zionists, he could not have insulted them in this way.

The video was a watershed for many. Daniel Finkelstein, a Tory peer and columnist for The Times of London, called the revelation “qualitatively different from anything that has come before.” Ben Judah, a Labour-voting author, said that “the nasty comment from Mr. Corbyn on ‘Zionists’ not getting ‘English irony’ has finally snapped the benefit of the doubt extended by many Jewish progressives.”

A writer for The Guardian, Simon Hattenstone, who has repeatedly defended Jeremy Corbyn against charges of anti-Semitism, called his speech “unquestionably anti-Semitic.” And it wasn’t just the Jews. George Monbiot, a giant of the British left, described the comments as “anti-Semitic and unacceptable.”

And from Mr. Corbyn’s most vehement defenders, such as the Guardian columnist Owen Jones or the Novara Media columnist Ash Sarkar? Crickets.

I’d always thought that if Mr. Corbyn was ever nailed down on this issue, he’d be spouting the anti-Semitism of the international left: Shadowy Zionist lobbyists. Omnipotent Rothschilds. Benjamin Netanyahu glorying in the slaughter of innocent children.

Instead we got something much closer to home. This was the anti-Semitism of Virginia Woolf and Agatha Christie. It was T.S. Eliot’s “lustreless” Bleistein puffing on his cigar and Roald Dahl insisting that “there is a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity.” The comments were more redolent of the genteel Shropshire manor house where Mr. Corbyn was raised than the anticapitalist resistance movements where he forged his reputation.

In recent months, most of the Anglo-Jewish community, normally happy to keep its collective head down, has been uncharacteristically vocal on the issue of Mr. Corbyn’s anti-Semitism.

 I haven’t. It’s probably because I’ve lived in England all my life, but I don’t like to make a fuss. I recoil from the paranoia and neurosis that haunts many older members of my community, though I recognize its cause. I have never wanted to be a PTSD Jew, forever stuck in 1933. And I really do appreciate that parsing anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism can be a tricky business.

Perhaps the deeper thing keeping me on the fence is that I desperately didn’t want to face the reality that Britain’s possible prime minister is a man who traffics in an ancient prejudice against my people. What would that say about my party — and about my country?

Here’s what I do know: My fellow British Jews were right. I was wrong. From now on, Jeremy Corbyn has my loud and implacable opposition.

72,dwvqsq3,"Around the world, major pride events are being used as battlegrounds to combat what some pro-Palestinian, progay activists are calling pink washing: Israel's promotion of its progressive gay-rights record as a way to cover up ongoing human-rights abuses in the West Bank and Gaza.

The accusations stem from efforts over the past half-decade by the Israeli government to weave the country's gay-friendly policies — including national hate-crime laws, employment protection for LGBT workers and openly gay military service — into its larger national-rebranding strategy, in the hopes of redirecting its global image away from politics, terrorism and the occupied territories. ""The Israeli government and its propaganda organs ... insist on advertising and exaggerating its recent record on LGBT rights ... to fend off international condemnation of its violations of the rights of the Palestinian people,"" says Joseph Massad, associate professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University in New York City.

Nonsense, counters Ido Aharoni, Israeli consul general in New York City and former head of the Brand Israel project. ""We are not trying to hide the conflict but broaden the conversation,"" he says. ""We want to create a sense of relevance with other communities.""

Although its foundations lie in decades of political struggle, the pink-washing movement has recently kicked into high gear. In June 2010, gay-pride parade organizers in Madrid banned a contingent of Israeli marchers in response to the deadly Gaza flotilla raid weeks earlier. That same month, activists protested the Israeli government's co-sponsorship of San Francisco's Frameline LGBT Film Festival. In March this year, the pro-Palestinian group Palestina protested a conference in Stockholm featuring Israeli LGBT cultural figures. And at the Berlin gay-pride parade on June 25, the Israeli delegation will reportedly promote Tel Aviv — rather than the country as a whole — in an attempt to avoid provoking anti-Israel sentiment.


On the other side of the issue, activists and the authorities who support Israel are pushing back against the anti–pink washers. In March, a planned Israeli Apartheid Week event at New York City's LGBT Community Center was canceled after loud opposition from local pro-Israel groups. And in Toronto, the Queers Against Israeli Apartheid has had to pull out of the July 3 pride parade after the mayor's office threatened to withhold funding for the parade.

While it may seem unusual, the conflation of LGBT politics with the Middle Eastern politics is somewhat inevitable. Jews have traditionally been at the forefront of historic LGBT-rights battles, while the gay community has long played a prominent role in the antioccupation movement. But what is surprising about the pink-washing movement is the relatively muted response from Jews themselves. A few New York Jewish groups did protest February's planned Apartheid Week event. But most major Jewish advocacy organizations, like the Anti-Defamation League, have stayed silent.

Much of that inaction is down to demographics: support for Israel is strongest among more-conservative American Jews who in general would neither be involved with the gay community nor publicly protest its anti-Israel activism. At the opposite extreme, progressive Jews typically back LGBT causes, but their progressiveness also extends to their opinions on Israel. As some of Israel's harshest critics, progressive Jews are inclined to back pro-Palestinian groups and often even form their core leadership. As a result, American Jews on every part of the ideological spectrum are unwilling to provide a counternarrative to the anti-pink-washing movement.

""As part of a minority group themselves, there is great ambivalence [among American Jews] about combating anti-Semitism on the left — particularly when it comes from other minority groups,"" says Kenneth Marcus, head of the Anti-Semitism Initiative at the Institute for Jewish and Community Research in Washington, D.C. ""The organized Jewish community is good at standing up against far-right hate groups, but has been far less successful in defending itself against nontraditional forms of anti-Semitism.""

Over in Israel, meanwhile, community leaders seem to view the debate as a problem for their country's image abroad that has little to do with LGBT issues at home. ""Rather than openly opposing international anti-Israel LGBT groups, the gay community in Israel has essentially ignored the pink-washing issue,"" says filmmaker Yair Qedar, whose recent movie Gay Days is the definitive history of the Israeli LGBT civil rights movement. ""This is a real shame because LGBT rights are something Israelis should be proud of — for ourselves, our neighbors and all peace-seeking people."" By making Israel out to be a ""pink leper,"" says Qedar, the anti-pink-washing movement ""ultimately serves homophobia far more than dialogue and peace.""

As Qedar suggests, the real danger of both pink washing and the anti-Israel opposition is their potential to distract both camps from the long-term goal of peace. Each side fails to recognize core — and perhaps, constructive — truths about the other: Israel does have some of the world's most progressive LGBT policies, yet it's also mired in an illegal, militarized West Bank occupation. These two realities not only can but already do co-exist between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea."
73,dv4cbss,"Growing up (90s) I genuinely thought Anti-Semitism was a thing from the past. I have a few Jewish family members and many of my closest friends are Jewish, but I'd never seen any racism or hatred towards them. Just never once experienced anything ""different"" about the Jewish community at all in how they treated others or how they *were* treated by others.

But something within the past decade changed that (obviously it's been going on forever, but over the past decade it's gone to super-liminal levels). Lots of loud, vile hatred for Jews coming from the alt right, lots of physical incidents involving synagogues. Among the Jewish people I know, several of them in the same time period have turned hard to zionism in what has to be a large-scale reaction to these rekindled feelings of direct persecution, one friend going as far to actually get conned into joining the IDF while on birthright, that's how threatened he was made to felt (he's literally an average white American kid who I grew up playing baseball and WoW with, now he proudly fights in a foreign occupying army like that's at all reasonable). It seems everyone is going crazy now.

Extremist tribalism is causing lots of problems to flare up, and it seems like the turbulence surrounding the jewish community is a good case study for how conservative tribal politics is totally fucking with previously stable communities--everything from a rise in blatant offensive anti-semetic attacks, to jewish communities internally falling out over fights centering around either supporting Trump (I've got a surprising amount of progressive Jewish friends whose parents are fully and inexplicably on the Trump train, probably because of his tactless and aggressive approach to the Israel-Palestine debacle) or turning to an extremist and exclusive zionist ideology. I sympathize with all the young people who are caught up in that cultural/political shitstorm."
74,fc2narr,"&gt; It's the question of is it ok to question whatever power the Jewish community may have.

What is your conception of the Jewish community? Do all Jews have the same interests and communal goals? What about all American Jews? What about all Jewish billionaires.

The answer to all of those questions is no, because the Jewish community is the same as the white community, made up of individuals with differing interests and goals.

&gt; The ""white community"" and men, for example, or Christians, are very often attacked for privilege.

There's good research on the topic of privilege. Having a black or foreign sounding name on your resume makes it less likely to get a response when you apply for a job. Women are still seen as homemakers and caretakers, which can often be an impediment to their careers. That's before we even get into the ongoing impacts of historical discrimination.

&gt; The official narrative is the Jewish people have no privilege or they deserve everything they have.

I've never heard that narrative. Any privilege Jews have only gets us so far, and probably comes from the fact that we're not a particularly visible minority. I look Irish if anything, and I can't tell you how many times I've been in a room full of white dudes and heard Jew used as a verb to mean rip off, or as an adjective to mean stingy. If you're not a minority, you probably don't understand how dehumanizing that is. If you're willing to casually reduce Jews to a caricature, you're susceptible to the kind of propaganda that put the Nazis in power. And that's just the thing - when the world descends into chaos, Jews are a target like any other minority.

&gt; When I see people throwing out such staggering percentages of ivy league students or billionaires or movie producers it begs the question of how or why?

Jewish wealth is a historical accident. In Europe, Jews were often barred from owning land, or occupying ""respectable"" professions. Christians and Muslims were often barred from usury, which at that time meant charging any interest at all. Jews filled the gaps in the market that Christians and Muslims wouldn't. Jews have always valued education and literacy, because it's our duty to read and interpret the Torah. This literacy made Jews well-suited to the professions that Christians and Muslims wouldn't take.

The money comes and goes with the whims of the host nation, but the knowledge is shared. For instance, my ancestors arrived in America without much more than the clothes on their backs, having been subject to pogroms in Poland. What they did have was literacy and knowledge of how to run a business. So, after landing at Ellis Island, they settled in Manhattan and started a business supplying farms across the river in New Jersey. This being the late-19th century, Manhattan was poised to explode economically, and within a generation, the family became extremely wealthy. Not much of that wealth made it to me, unfortunately.

&gt; How or why are powers that be the powers that be. Is that acceptable free speech?

It should be acceptable to ask these questions. We need to be willing to answer them, because if we don't, then someone like Richard Spencer will."
75,g0lz48j,"I posted this earlier. However, someone here recommended I post it again, as its own thing. Sorry for the dissertation. But, I have been frustrated for a very long time now. Years.

I've been growing more concerned over the last year, mostly because I have been at ground zero for seeing the problems in the Dallas Community. From what I see, there a few big problems in the community. And I think, within the next 2-4 years, one of them will end becoming local (at the least) news, probably causing damage to the community in some way.

The first big problem I am seeing is how conservatism is being pushed hard, I think by Suleiman. I've noticed people pushing more and more of the ""traditional"" view in the past year, with a few saying that I have been taught wrong on history in the Islamic World, always men. For instance, pointing out that the current treatment of gays in the Muslim World dates back to only the colonial period, with the period before that being close-ish to ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" but with the wrinkle that it was openly written about. I would term them as ""Well, Actuallys."" I also saw that basically anything I would say would get instant criticism. For instance, one time I pointed out that Young Europeans Muslims are leaving Islam, and said that I think it is because European Muslims are too strict, the same guy who said I was wrong on history got really belligerent with me, asking if I had statistics for it, to which I said, no, because no study had been done, only people noting it was happening. He then got fairly aggressive with me, saying that I couldn't say anything about it then, though I did manage to interject that I personally knew through gaming a few Danish ex-Muslims who left for precisely that reason, and a fairly Liberal semi-observant Muslim noting that she has seen many young Muslims leave Islam in the UK because of how strict things are there. I can expand on this a bit, but I fit into this. Because, I am not normal. I am Autistic. But, on top of that, poor experiences in life with men led me to be primarily friends with women, near exclusively. This started in Middle School, and I converted to Islam in my Junior Year of college. Until Dallas, this was fine. In OKC, with an AMAZING Imam there helping, people were able to set ground rules for what they were comfortable with, and things were ok. In Dallas however, there has been a constant push towards getting me to be friends with only men. I have found friends, including one guy, but I still feel super-uncomfortable around men, and being Autistic, I can be a burden, so need double the number of friends so I don't wear people out. And yet, the OKC community, which is newer and more conservative was able to figure things out for me. That's unacceptable.

The Second Big Problem is that the Dallas Community doesn't like having to do anything if it requires effort, or if it doesn't put forward the right image. You can already see a bit of that with the trying to force me into their ideal image, nevermind that they don't apply to it (I see Inter-Gender friendships everywhere). But, I can cite Suleiman here, I think. Because, I always see him promoting countless initiatives, but I never see long term support for any of them. Muhsen, for example, wants to help those with disabilities. However, they lack for funding and support, and cannot help on job placement. He's everywhere, but he doesn't seem to provide any long term support, despite his stature. And I see this everywhere with me. Anytime I ask for help, I either get an ""I am busy, talk to me later"" and later never comes, told to talk to therapist even though in 90% of cases it is talking about something well outside of that, or in some cases, just ignored. There are some good Imams here, but they lack the pull to help me, even though they have said that I do need the help I ask for. But, there is overall a callous disregard, I think, for anything that is not easily resolved. I even found a woman who I don't think is human, because when trying to ask her for help, ended up in a (need to find the word) loop. I explained the problem I had, she came up with a dismissive answer, replied why that wouldn't work, she gave an answer that very much sounded like her just wanted me to be outside the community, when I pushed back on that, she then said she didn't mean it like that, and then went back to the dismissive answer to the problem I had earlier. She sounded more like a computer, and lacked any empathy. And the thing is, again, OKC helped me. And they had less resources, but the big Imam there cared more about his community than having his face everywhere. 

Which brings me to my last problem, which might be the most serious. The neglect of the local convert community, and the radicalization going on there. As far as I am aware, Omar Suleiman has no awareness of this to any great extent. However, the local converts are going in weird directions. I see them quoting [Ibn Tayymiyyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Taymiyyah). Which is a very, very bad thing, considering that bastard is the origin to most of the suffering and grief in the Muslim World right. Then quoting some no name lunatic name Daniel Haqiqatjou, who has posted some vile misogynist bullshit, among much, much more. Not only that, but I have heard some of them praising various anti-American groups, even voicing support for the Taliban. Yet, Omar Suleiman doesn't even know about this, I don't think.

Which brings me to what I think will happen will happen in the next 2-4 years. I see this going in one of two directions. First, a young, probably teenage, Muslim in the area who will likely be struggling with either being gay, being in a situation like where they distrust making friends of their own gender, or perhaps something I can't think of, will be neglected by the community because they are ""too busy"" or being forced to be something they are not. And that poor young person will commit suicide from the neglect or pressure. Second, one of these converts that the community and Omar Suleiman hasn't been paying attention to commits a terror attack on US soil.

As for what I think about Suleiman? I don't know. The progressiveislam subreddit thinks he is a snake in the grass, trying to marginalize more liberal, more flexible forms of Islam within the US. I'm not so sure, though he is a [Hanbali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanbali), and the Hanbalis have given rise to the Wahhabis and Salafis. (I hate them more than you can possibly imagine. I only hate the Taliban more on the face of the Planet). And Hanbalis have a long history of violence, including persecuting another School of Fiqh to extinction. [He seems more reasonable though, and has supported LGBT rights in the US in the past](https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2016/06/16/qa-islamic-scholar-omar-suleiman-on-the-quran-and-homosexuality/). But, I will note that he really hasn't talked to more Liberal Muslims very much, and has preferred to meet Evangelical Christians over the Jewish Community. Going back to OKC, the Jewish Community is small, but, as I know you are tired of hearing, my Imam in OKC constantly reaches out to them and does stuff. Even though the Jewish Community is much smaller there. I can't imagine Suleiman meets with them either. Within a decade, the political power of the Evangelicals will be gone, as their numbers collapse, and will cease being a threat to American Muslims. Also, trying to do stuff for the Biden Campaign, I know they tried to contact him, but I don't believe he got back to them. Posed and chatted with Bernie though.

And I have met Omar Suleiman. He was extremely hard to read. People with Autism lack cognitive empathy, but have emotional empathy in spades. So, I can get a feeling off of people given time. He came across as vaguely pleasant. But, weirdly, I have to note his hands. They were bizarrely soft. I've never felt softer hands."
76,ffucfuy,"To handle the complaint, Hillel has chosen to retain the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), a right-wing Christian evangelical organization known for its efforts to limit LGBTQ and abortion rights around the world. The partnership is an especially dramatic example of how Hillel’s aggressive tactics for shutting down pro-Palestine activity on campuses can put it in league with far-right political forces, even as the organization markets itself as a mainstream, inclusive space for campus Jews. 

The liaison with the ACLJ has raised eyebrows among Jewish leaders who have otherwise had a good relationship with Hillels of Georgia. “The ACLJ in so many ways undermines the kinds of religious freedoms that I hold dear as a Jewish man and also as somebody who was worked to ensure that our Jewish community is open to LGBTQ folks,” says Rabbi Joshua Lesser of Congregation Bet Haverim in Atlanta, a Reconstructionist congregation originally founded in 1986 as a gay and lesbian synagogue. “Even just on the basis of what the ACLJ wants to do to make Christianity more formalized in our schools and in our government, it really works against the best interests of what I know Hillels of Georgia stands for.”"
77,em2ccru,"I agree that the Jewish community is failing to protect itself and that article has no idea what it is talking about. However not necessarily because the U.S. government was formed only to protect us from foreign powers.

The preamble to the U.S. Constitution says that one of the rationales for the Constitution is to

&gt;insure domestic Tranquility


Protecting the people from internal threats was equally important as protecting the people from external threats. This is one of the reasons that members of Congress, enlisted military personnel, and military officers in their oaths all swear or affirm to

&gt;support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic

Domestic threats exist, including terrorism threats and criminal threats, 

I agree that people depend on the government for too much inducing their own safety and the safety of their communities; and the repeated calls for  for gun control and other laws after every incident demonstrates the eagerness some people have to look to the government to solve every problem, including personal and collective security. But that does not mean that the government has no role in protecting its citizens from internal threats, because that has been a role of the U.S. government since its founding. 


Jews need to step up and protect ourselves and our community, but that does not mean the government should stand back and do nothing. It should take a more aggressive role in identifying potential shooters before they pull the trigger, but when they do walk into a shul on Shabbos ready to fire, it’s on us to defend ourselves."

the situation you described that happened today is unfortunate. and it is true that a significant portion of the population deals with addiction issues. it's a difficult call, some may offer either food, clothes, bus tokens or other basic necessities rather than straight up cash.

also, i'm assuming most of the people you are giving to are non-Jews because there really are very few Jews on the streets. i think this is because the Jewish community is very good at taking care of one another and there are a lot of philanthropic Jewish organizations. but there are still plenty of Jewish beggers out there who may not necessarily be homeless but still in great need. so maybe you'd feel better reaching out to those in need within your own community first?"

Possibly...we dont know its too far into the future to tell....Although its not just the countries, its the people in those countries that wont want to live next to Israelis while Israel treats Palestinians like they do. A somewhat similar event would be South Africans during Apartheid. Those people were looked down upon because of what their government did. Again, this cannot be entirely determined at this point in time. There are too many unknowns. 

&gt;Could you maybe not use phrases like ""Corruption caused by the Jewish community."" It sounds horrifically anti-semetic the way you put it, like we're some shadowy puppet masters controlling the US government.

You are reaching a conclusion based on your pre-conceived notions. The Jewish community is very organized as per **your previous comments** and they have injected massive amounts of money through organizations like AIPAC. In today's America: Money = Voice. The Jewish community is not a shadowy puppet, they are very vocal and in your face if you dare to have an opposing viewpoint. Some really unlucky people have been targeted and ruined by these people just for having an opposing viewpoint. 

So yes they are one of many well funded groups controlling the US government....thats the corruption I keep saying is a problem that you seem to ignore in every single comment I reply to you. Thats the corruption that could cause the collapse that I keep talking about. Big businesses and highly organized people with money (you know like the jewish and religious right community) buying politicians with money. 

I will not lower my criticism of them just because your thought process defaults to someone automatically being anti-semitic, racist, or prejudiced in any way. 

&gt;I think you're completely missing my point about the Haredim. They will continue to multiply like rabbits in good economies or bad. They have a much lower labor participation rate than the rest of the country.

To make up for the decline in birth rate? Did you look at my links, the decline is quite big from 1960. I'm sure Haredim will prevent Israel's average birthrate from collapsing as bad like the rest of the wast. (Europe &amp; Japan have a negative birthrate, the countries are shrinking and the US would also shrink but they are net zero thanks to immigration). But even today that link shows a terrible prospective from 1960. Its mainly going down, just slower. I wish I had more stats on Palestine to compare to.  I can't seem to find Pew stats on that region. 

&gt;There will be plenty of places for Israelis to move to. Israelis will be at least nominally welcome in India, Canada, the USA, Russia and much of the EU for instance, although staying away from the Muslim districts may be hard. Like it's never been easy being a Jew, but regardless of how large a Muslim minority you have, it's going to be better than the Ukraine.

We will see, there will definetly be some immigration but all these countries have quotas. You can't just move millions of people into each country or else more people would be moving. [There is a per country limit in the US](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/glossary/country-limit) 

If the Religious right have their way (doubt it) this may be increased for Israel but we will see. This may be one of the few issues that the Jewish community does not have the power to impact on their own without the help of the religious right. Immigration in the US can be a dicey subject and others are gonna look at an increase of the immigration quota for Israel and complain loudly that they are getting unfair treatment. 

&gt;I think the Pew Research data is flawed and fails to account for the varying definitions of a Jew. For instance, this data fails to account for Cultural or Ethnic Jews, which is a much much larger group. The total number of people eligible for Aliya is about double the core Jewish population.

Ok then can you provide a better source than Newsweek or businessinsider then? Some research firm at least....

The numbers seem pretty clear on those. I tried finding other sources that are not just jewish newspapers or editorial articles and [this is all I could find](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/year-2050-10-countries-predicted-to-have-the-highest-jewish-population-in-the-world.html). I am not sure how reputable this site worldatlas is. 

Do you at least agree that the Muslim population is currently larger than the Jewish population and by 2050 will still be larger than the Jewish population? Are we at least on the same page regarding that? I dont know anymore, you are skipping major points so I have no clue what you agree or disagree on anymore. 

&gt;I think you're implying that India wouldn't take any opportunity possible to intentionally piss off Pakistan. /s

They both have nuclear weapons and China is very much investing in Pakistan and would not want Pakistan to mess up the oil pipelines and ports that China is building at their expense for Pakistan. Right there are two solid reasons for India and Pakistan to stay as nice as they can to each other.

&gt;But in all seriousness, the Israel has had to have a mostly internal economy in the past, and it survived that. 

Israel is what it is because of handouts from the US to give them a leg up against their neighbors. That is how they have won many of their wars and how they continue to keep Palestinians under this terrible condition where they have almost no chance at a better life. It is disgusting and I am ashamed that the US taxpayer has been on the hook for this all because of the corruption in the country. My dream America would have been an America which minded its own damn business. I think many people would not have any feelings about Israel one way or the other is the US stayed out of it. I had hoped for a split second that Trump would have kept his word and make the US become more independent but as I suspected, he did not actually intend to do anything he promised.  

&gt;Besides,Israel is going to be selling Europe a lot of gas soon, and is going to be making a lot of friends in the region.

Does Israel have massive gas deposits? Its just a tiny strip of dirt, where did they get gas? Regardless, that is not long term sustainable seeing as Europe is even more aggressive than the US in switching to green energy. They currently depend on Russia for a significant portion of their fuel and are terrified that Russia would one day cut them off so there is a massive push to move quickly to renewable. In addition to that, the northern countries like Netherlands will suffer greatly from climate change. In the worse case projections, the majority of the Netherlands could disappear underwater by 2050 so they are super uninterested in adopting any new gas deals. Im not saying the EU will not want to adopt any new gas deals, its just that long term its not a good benefit.

People are not mad because they wanted to be part of your event.

They are mad because you are racist. You keep calling anyone who doesn't have black enough skin, including native americans, asians, and black people you simply don't believe ""black"" enough, to be ""white privilege"". Excuse me, but according to Statscan 2013, the Jewish community is significantly more likely to experience hate crimes, despite Jews being only a fraction of the black community. Jews face so much hate and discrimination that they had to set up entire organizations like the ADL just to catalogue incidents of antisemitism. Oh, most Jews also had most of their families genocided as a result of the holocaust, further expelled from their homes in the middle east by oppressive arab states, and forced to come to America in poverty with nothing but  their orphaned brothers and sisters. People like Bernie Sanders say they grew up very poor for a reason. How much are you going to hog the narrative spotlight before Mexicans, Native Americans, and Jews also get pissed? That isn't to compare for pity-points, but rather a plea to stop bullying other minorities and calling anyone who disagrees with you ""white privilege"". Excuse me, but do the Jews fucking look like they've had ANY privilege for the past 100-200-300-1000 years? It's not always ""Black vs White"". Sometimes people are simply pissed at you for being a racist asshole.

Yes, true, in the BLM(too) movement, Blacks do face disproportionate violence by police officers. This is a fact.  Something needs to be done, it is why the BLM(too) movement is so important.  What the black community faces is a history not like any other. The atrocities of slavery, and the racism to this day. This is why the movement is called BlackLivesMatter(too) and not AllLivesMatter, because the entire point of BLM(too) is to point out the unique problems facing the black community as unique. Many people, including so-called ""white"" folks sympathize with Black Lives Matter. The exact point of BLM(too) is to raise awareness, and if you actually give a shit about the movement, you would do well to be inclusive. 

Also, for the sake of journalistic integrity, Tucker Carlson should've let her talk. I wanted to hear what she was trying to explain, regardless if I disagree, and the asshole kept interrupting her. Tucker Carlson was not polite, and he was aggressive. He was trying to have an opinion and push it in order to ""win the debate"". That's not the job of a journalist. The job of a journalist is to *shut the fuck up* and let OTHER people talk! Where is Larry King when we need him? FFS"
84,fxud482,"Rob has been getting the get out of jail brown card for way too long by Hollywood and its industry’s media, perhaps because he’s married to a Mexican, perhaps out of fear. But the collaboration he has had over the years with questionable race humor goes back a long way to all his stunts with even worse offender Adam Sandler. Makes you wonder if their “chosen tribe” ethnic identity helps to a great extent shield them from all this douchebaggery, as if people fear been called antisemitic for pointing them out (since he’s not the only one doing it, because that’s the kind of tunnel vision game the ADL often plays, a huge contrast to real life, where young Jewish folks are often the majority of whites alongside us in our movements pushing back against bigotries on non whites and immigrants in particular.) 
The one thing I can say on behalf of IASIPhiladelphia is that characters depicting racist attitudes are always confronted by others right in that episode and they are rarely have recurring roles. Also, the bulk of their ethnic humor is on other whites, AND the show is openly meant to be hella crass to begin with, so it’s kinda cynical to point at one character and yell “BIGOTRY, THIS IS RACIST!”  while laughing your myopic ass off at the other 98, 99% cringy content."
85,fwrmsii,"Oh wow you covered a LOT of ground there.

I am a fairly shallow, wishy washy sort of jewish Leftist so I can not really go into the depth you are asking for, of how to square national self determination with leftist thought.

I really only have some low level things to mention about your post.

""Anti zionist is anti Semitic because Zionism is Jewish self determination."" As a general rule this sort of thing can be dismissed out of hand as the deflection and smokescreen it is. National self determination tends to apply, as far as I understand it, to the rights of communities under the thumb of an imperialist power. The context of ZIonism in Palestine is different, it is a settler colonial state which allows the largely immigrant jewish people to use the indigenous Palestinian population as cheap labor and target practice.

 ""You can't colonize land that you're already indigenous to."" This is also something that can be dismissed out of hand. 

First Palestine really is not that vital to our history. It was the location of the Temple sure, but if you look at where Jews have actually lived, worked and flourished Palestine is not that important. The Jewish history of Babylonia, Egypt and Spain is much, much more important than Palestine if you look at where our religious life was centered and our culture flourished. For example, when the Catholic Inquisition destroyed the Jewish community of Spain the overwhelming majority of refugees fled to the great muslim cities like Istanbul and Cairo, only a tiny number of Kabbalists made their way to Palestine. Over the fourteen centuries of Islam the Jewish people flourished in Egypt, Spain and Iraq, they had an opportunity to settle in Palestine at any time, but only some did, it was like the Jewish Wisconsin.

It is true we remember Jerusalem in our religious rituals but in reality Palestine is not terribly important historically.

Second, the Jews were exiled in Christian Europe for the better part of 1500 years. If we can claim Palestine as our ancestral land then, frig, The french need to give Gaul back to the Italians. It is just complete nonsense. It would also force North American Zionists to concede the point that the American aboriginals have the right to every city, town and village in the country, but obviously they would see that as absurd.

 ""Ashkenazi and other ""European Jews"" are not actually European and still  have a claim to the Holy Land because of their oppression by Europeans  for millennia."" 

That's the same as saying ""Someone mugged my wife so I am going to steal your car."" It is not the Palestinian's fault Hitler gassed 6 million of us, they do not need to pay for the crimes of European Christians.

"" I AM NOT A ZIONIST. ISRAEL IS AN ILLEGITIMATE IMPERIALIST STATE PLANNED  OUT BY SYKES AND PICOT RATHER THAN ANYONE WHO WAS ACTUALLY LIVING ON THE  LAND.""

I just want to point out there is a bit of a myth that Israel came into being with the help of European powers after World War One. Jewish Zionist immigration was already taking place during the Ottoman period in which tends of thousands of settlers arrived. I don't think the transfer of Palestine from the Ottomans to the British really sped that process up, but that is just me being speculative.

In reality the British administration sided with the arabs far more frequently than the Jews, Britain was actively hostile to Zionism by the end. Israel came into being because of Jewish action more than the intentions of the British and French.

""But then does that argument from earlier, that all Jewish folks are  indigenous to Israel after all this time still hold up? I think in some  ways it does because European Jews were isolated for centuries from  white Europeans and treated as subhuman, never assimilated....""

Identity is a complex topic, for the Jews doubly so. As two Rabbis ""What is a Jew"" and expect six different answers.

The problem is that it centers the question of Palestine on the European Jewish identity crisis of the late nineteenth/early twentieth centuries. 

We need to remember that for most of the Exile the overwhelming majority of Jews lived in the Islamic world, not in Christian Europe. It would not be until the late nineteenth century that the European Jews reached the stature that the Jews of the Islamic world held for about one thousand years. The founder of Zionism as an international movement, Theodore Herzl, lied about his family tree because claiming decent from the Jews of Islamic Spain was more glorious than claiming descent from the Ashkenazi. At the time Israel was founded in 1948 roughly eight hundred thousand Jewish refugees from the Islamic world settled there, doubling Israel's population.

But what was the experience of the Jews in muslim lands? Did they see themselves as a Nation in the European, Zionist sense?

Nope.

In the Islamic world Jews defined themselves just as a religious minority in the Islamic world, as Dhimmi, as we had done for centuries. There was no idea of us as our own nation, no nationalism that came from seeing ourselves as victims of a coldly antisemitic world.

So what about the European Identity crisis I mentioned earlier?

In Europe we attempted to assimilate as citizens into liberal democracies, just as we do today in America. It is only because certain ideas of nationalism and race became popular in Germany and other parts of Europe we were forced to see ourselves as a national group. Many other Jews rejected both Liberalism and Nationalism and instead chose to fight for socialism.

It is not the natural default for Jews to see ourselves as a nation. Half the Jews in Israel after its founding had come from Muslim lands where it was just a religious identity. And in Europe, for every one Jew who adopted Zionism there was one Liberal and one Socialist to balance things. 

We need to remember Jewish nationalism is contingent on historic circumstances and artificial.

"" Is a two state solution, even if it's non imperialist decolonized states, ever just? ""

Lastly we just need to get back down to the reality on the ground here. The simple fact is that it is not possible to separate the Land into two states anymore. Physically there are hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers linked by bypass roads and common utilities all over the West Bank, and those people quite simply are not going to leave anymore than Palestinians are going to leave their homes in Haifa or Tel Aviv for Hebron or Nablus.

Culturally there is just too much memory there, too many things sacred to Jews and Muslims all over the place. To many old photo albums on both sides.

The only real, practical answer imo is a single democratic state.

But YMMV."
86,fxkke1j,"The Third Reich left a deep scar in the world. Germany doesn’t deny the Holocaust, but they did prosecute their war criminals either. The allies did that, but Germany did not enforce the prison terms. So many war criminals who were not executed were sent home, and they raised families. 

Antisemitism remains a very real problem in modern Germany. Not just the alt right. The Jewish community is very small. Less than a million Jews live in Germany. Parents caution their children not to tell their friends that they are Jewish. Jewish children are often bullied in school. Administrators try to blame Muslim immigrants, but they are not in charge of the schools. The bullying is allowed to continue. 

Germany seems destined to lead the EU. They have the strongest economy. They are an industrious people, but they remain morally unfit for leadership. 

I was hopeful when Merkle attempted to lead Europe in the acceptance of Syrian refugees. That sort of thing is precisely the sort of thing required to heal the wounds of history because it’s the opposite of what the Third Reich stood for."
87,fzat9uz,"I think we have moved off of the point that I was trying to make. A vote for Trump is not a vote for Hitler. 

First, I do not agree with your assertion that the majority of the Jewish Community is afraid of Trump. The election results of the one election with Trump on the ticket hardly equates to a voting pattern. Voting patterns also do not equate to fear.

Second, a detention center for illegal immigrants is not an internment camp. Additionally, I find it hard to believe that the U.S. policy is to detain legal citizens. I will concede that there is potential for a disparate impact situation arising from a policy requiring citizens to carry documentation and subsequent racial profiling by ICE. That can be mitigated by better training of officers. That still does not equate to what i meant by rounding up minorities. There no call for the detainment of all peoples of South or Central American descent to be imprisoned without a hearing and placed in a prison camp.

Third, open borders are not safe for a country as large as the United States. We need people residing in the U.S. to have documentation (social security number, visa, green card, etc.) and be held to similar standards (taxes, criminal records, etc.). Therefore, there must be some detention of illegal immigrants (even those seeking asylum) in order to disincentive illegal immigration. There is a process in which those seeking asylum are detained and given a hearing to determine whether they qualify

We can keep going but I think we have gotten off topic. I am not saying to vote for Trump. All I am saying is that a vote for Trump is not a vote for Hitler. 

(Also, I did not downvote this post or your comment, so I am not quite sure what you meant, but here’s an upvote? Thanks for the back and forth, sincerely. Good conversation.)"
88,fzjru5p,"As far as I can tell, the Dunkel paper is about the Wisconsin Longitudinal study.  Wisconsin is a very strange Jewish community, partially settled by intentional transfer of Jewish families from New York city by Industrial Removal Office.  It seems to have been a magnet for a certain set of Jewish immigrant post WW2, but this initial surge died out.  [This](https://www.wiscontext.org/what-happened-wisconsins-once-thriving-smaller-jewish-communities) is a good article on the phenomenon.    

It is possible the Wisconsin Jewish community is representative of the entire US Jewish community, but it is also possible that it is quite different.  The studied population (n=53) scored twice has high (5.62)  as the Catholic (2.45)  or Lutheran (2.32) population on education level.   I do not know if the broader Jewish community has twice the education level of the gentile community, but I doubt it without evidence to the contrary.  

&gt; If you don't like those studies,

I was just quoting Lynn, who notes there are no studies with &gt;100 participants that demonstrate high Jewish IQ by means of an IQ test.  I don't doubt that Jewish people are successful, but the question is whether that success is due to IQ or other factors, like a cultural preference for education."

90,fv9jvfe,"No one is blame free and no one side is 100% correct. I'll speak for Egypt here and what happened to Egyptian Jews

1. The Egyptian Jewish community is actually diverse, with most of them being immigrants that came to Egypt in the 18th and 19th centuries but are still Egyptians anyway. There is/was a small indigenous Egyptian jewish community who share common ancestry with Egyptian Muslims &amp; Christians. A good number of the recent immigrants did have foreign passports

2. The Kingdom of Egypt was very corrupt and Europeans and European-educated Egyptians controlled the country. By the time Abdel Nasser assumed power in 1952, he implemented land reform lands. Privately owned lands and businesses were seized from the elites and now state controlled or given to the poorer segments of society. This angered many in the Egyptian Jewish community as they were extremely wealthy and controlled land and businesses. However these reforms affected all Egyptians, wasn't created to target Jews specifically as Muslims &amp; Christians who owned lands lost a lot

3. The Mossad did run numerous false flag and covert operations that would target Jewish-owned businesses and usually blame the general Egyptian populus in an attempt to make Jews feel they were unsafe. A famous example of such was the Lavon Affair, where the Mossad trained Egyptian Jews to commit terrorist acts. The state did execute them but again that isn't necessarily targeting the Egyptian Jewish community but targeting individuals that betrayed their state. We can't deny that the Jewish community did face anti-semitism from the broader community and couldve very easily played a vital role in the decision of some families to leave

4. At the time, Egypt did not recognize Israel and considered it to be an enemy state. It was Egyptian law that any Egyptian citizen, regardless of religion, that defected to Israel would have their citizenship permanently revoked. That law at the time made sense since spies between the two states was common place. From the Egyptian Jewish community's POV, made of their lands had been taken via the reforms and there was growing anti-Israel sentiment following the war. The biggest issue in Egyptian society is the false assumption that Jew = Israel and that is something Israel has propagated and exploited to get more Arab Jews to immigrate there.

5. If I'm not mistaken, most Egyptian Jews actually left for France, UK, and the USA as a huge number of them were Western-educated and would speak french or english at home. The poorer Egyptian Jews eventually immigrated to Israel but even today they make a very small minority and have married other Jews. Now the bulk of Egyptian Jewish immigration occurred after the 1967 War. Anti-Israel &amp; Anti-Jewish sentiment was at an all time high and Egypt has at its lowest point in history. Egyptian land and honoured had been destroyed and societal bullying did occurred in some instances.

6. Now of course the Egyptian Jewish community isn't blame -free of course. Many prominent and wealthy Egyptian Jewish families did fund Israel in its early stages and supported them in more covert ways like sending their kids to kibbutz for training. Some members from within the community did defect to Israel and were open Zionists. Regardless of our view on Zionism, it is outlawed in Egypt and has negatively affected the Egyptian state and people.

7. Overall, it's a shame what happened because I'm of the belief that Egypt is the home of all Egyptians regardless of their religion, ethnicity, or whichever. I'd blame both sides but overall we can't change history and Israel definitely propagated and lied about many historical aspects"

&gt; # [Post-Soviet immigration strengthens Kazakhstan’s Jewish community](https://eurasianet.org//Rabbi Elchanan Cohen, Almaty’s chief rabbi, leading the havdalah ceremony to mark the end of the Sabbath. (all photos: Chabad of Kazakhstan\))
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; The Jewish experience in Eurasia during the post-Soviet era has been largely defined by emigration to Israel. But in Kazakhstan’s case, immigration is helping shape the country’s small, but diverse Jewish community, infusing it with a greater sense of cohesion.
&gt; 
&gt; The community’s strong organizational abilities have helped it negotiate a variety of challenges since Kazakhstan gained independence in 1991, including the coronavirus pandemic. As Kazakhstani authorities began lifting a nationwide coronavirus lockdown on May 12, Yeshaya Cohen, Kazakhstan’s chief rabbi, reported that no member of the Jewish community had at that point succumbed to COVID-19.
&gt; 
&gt; Solidarity within the community helped minimize the COVID-19 risks: At the first signs of the pandemic, Cohen and other religious leaders implemented preventative measures – using social media to organize volunteers to assist more vulnerable members of the community, ensuring regular food supplies to the elderly and providing other essential services. They also moved religious services and instruction online.
&gt; 
&gt; “The community is strong because it is united,” Cohen said.
&gt; 
&gt; Cohen, who has served as chief rabbi since 1994, is among the small number of post-Soviet immigrants that now comprise the backbone of Kazakhstan’s Jewish community. All of the rabbis in the country are immigrants, and all are members of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, a Hasidic sect based in Brooklyn, New York.
&gt; 
&gt; Cohen immigrated to Kazakhstan from Israel almost 25 years ago. Other Chabad-Lubavitchers who have moved to Kazakhstan since 1991 have come from Ukraine, Russia, the United States, Canada and Australia.
&gt; 
&gt; [Rabbi Yeshaya Cohen, Chief Rabbi of Kazakhstan](https://eurasianet.org/sites/default/files/media/image/Rabbi%20Yeshaya%20Cohen%2C%20Cheif%20Rabbi%20of%20Khazakhstan.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;  Yeshaya Cohen, Kazakhstan’s chief rabbiWhile most Hasidic sects tend to be insular, Chabad-Lubavitchers are known for their outreach to other Jewish denominations. The movement operates a network of self-sustaining community centers, schools and social outreach programs in over 75 countries, including Kazakhstan. There is also a missionary component: Some Chabad-Lubavitchers, known as emissaries, relocate around the globe to reinforce Jewish communities that, for a variety of reasons, find themselves beleaguered.
&gt; 
&gt; Mina Liberow, 30, and her husband, Rabbi Saadia Liberow, moved to Almaty from Brooklyn with their children four years ago. Having grown up in Brazil to parents of Chabad emissaries there, Rabbi Liberow is no stranger to living in a remote location with the goal of building a Jewish community. Rabbi Liberow is certified to slaughter animals in accordance with Jewish law, and his skills were needed in Kazakhstan. Mina Liberow, who was raised in a Chabad family in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, also assists with programming and classes at the Almaty synagogue. “The goal of Chabad is to help Jews all over the world, so we move to countries where there are Jews to provide for them,” she told Eurasianet.
&gt; 
&gt; The most reliable estimates peg the number of Jews in Kazakhstan, a country of about 18.5 million, at between 3,000-4,000. Cohen, the chief rabbi, asserted that the community is “growing.” In addition to Almaty, there are congregations in Nur-Sultan, Karagandy, Kostanay, Pavlodar, Oskemen, and Shymkent.
&gt; 
&gt; While Chabad-Lubavitchers occupy leadership roles, the community comprises a broad array of Jewish denominations and ethnicities.
&gt; 
&gt; Mina Liberow suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the Jewish community closer together via Zoom and other web-based communications platforms. “We pray all together and the rabbi will speak [online],” she said. “We try to collaborate as much as we can.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mordechai Morozow, 28, and his wife, Shoshana, 26, moved to Shymkent from Crown Heights with their three children last August as Chabad emissaries. Mordecai is a rabbi who leads the congregation. Since their arrival, Shoshana said, more Jews have been showing up to services. The Shymkent community, which she estimates at around 100 people, comprises mainly Russian speakers with young families.
&gt; 
&gt; Shoshana added that she and her husband did not think twice about relocating to Shymkent, a city in southern Kazakhstan near the Uzbek border. They both knew early on they wanted to be emissaries. “It’s our mission to take care of other Jews and to bring everyone close to Judaism,” she said. “So as a young couple this is what we wanted to do.""
&gt; 
&gt; [ At his bar mitzvah a boy reads from the Torah accompanied by Rabbi Elchanan Cohen, Almaty’s chief rabbi. ](https://eurasianet.org/sites/default/files/media/image/IMG_20170605_102504.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;  At his bar mitzvah a boy reads from the Torah accompanied by Rabbi Elchanan Cohen, Almaty’s chief rabbi.The diversity of Kazakhstan’s Jewish community is a result of the region’s traumatic 20th century. Relatively few Jews lived in Kazakhstan prior to the 1930s; most descended from Russian military conscripts who helped conquer the region in the late 19th century. The number began to swell during Stalin’s great terror in the late ‘30s, with thousands of Jews from across the Soviet Union dispatched to labor camps or otherwise exiled to Kazakhstan. Others fled to Central Asia to escape the invading Nazi army during World War II.
&gt; 
&gt; Among the deportees of that era was Rabbi Levi Yitzchak Schneerson, a prominent rabbi from the Ukrainian city of Yekaterinoslav, now known as Dnipro. Schneerson was the father of Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh and last Rebbe, or spiritual leader, of the Chabad-Lubavitcher movement.
&gt; 
&gt; Levi Yitzchak Schneerson died in Almaty in 1944. Given that many Chabad-Lubavitchers revere his son, the Rebbe, the elder Schneerson’s grave near the Almaty synagogue has become a pilgrimage site.
&gt; 
&gt; Just a few months before Levi Yitzchak Schneerson’s death, a young rabbi named Hillel Liberov, the great-granduncle of Saadia Liberow, the rabbi from Brooklyn, arrived in Almaty.
&gt; 
&gt; Liberov served as the de facto leader of Kazakhstan's post-World War II Jewish community in Kazakhstan, as three Almaty congregations were merged into one even though deportations of Jews to Kazakhstan continued in the late 1940s/early ‘50s. Not only did he lead religious services, he was also trained, like his great-grandnephew, as a ritual animal slaughterer. Because the outward practice of religion was largely prohibited under the communist regime, Hillel had to keep traditions alive in the shadows.When Hillel Liberov died in 1982, the Jewish community was left without a leader until 1994, when Rabbi Cohen arrived under the direction of the Chabad-Lubavitcher movement.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to the community organizing efforts of the Chabad-Lubavitchers, Israel provides assistance to help sustain Kazakhstan’s Jewish community. A steady trickle of Kazakhstani Jews is still emigrating to Israel, many of them moving in search of more economic opportunities. But others have carved out business careers in Kazakhstan, effectively serving as a commercial bridge to Israel.
&gt; 
&gt; Liat Wexelman, the Israeli ambassador to Kazakhstan, praised in late 2019 the expansion of bilateral trade ties. “Israel is considered the startup nation and has many cutting-edge, state-of-the-art technologies in fields that are top priority for the government of Kazakhstan,” the Jewish News Syndicate [quoted](https://www.jns.org/israel-kazakhstan-relations-continue-to-expand-and-diversify-under-new-president/) Wexelman as saying. “We succeeded in forging some durable partnerships.”
&gt;

92,ft749m2,"as another user told you, theya re influential but not outside Chubut, and most european groups didn't remain distinct and mixed pretty well with the local culture.

I'd say the jewish community is the most distinct of them, but you can find a ew smaller communities in different provinces but only in small towns and colonies of a couple thousand people or less.

Look into the celebrations made to honor the immigrants in Misiones and Entre Rios and you can find Swedes, Russians, germans having their own small communities founded in the late 19th century"
93,fornfnn,"There are black jews, asian jews, middle eastern jews. There are white jews.

Your point falls flat completely, the variance inside the jewish community is as big as the variance of the muslim community.

What you fail to understand is that race is a construct. Always. We do not decide race by genetics.

Elseways, it hardly makes sense that someone from spain is seen as white while someone of spanish descent in the US is seen as Latino.
It makes no sense that Greek people are seen as any different form the turkish.
It certainly makes no sense that a polish jew is seen as the same race as a middle eastern jew but not as another polish christian.

Race is about how a group is perceived inside and outside the group.
Latinos in the US form a group, even tho they dont have the same descent oftentimes (some are from portugal, other from spain). Portugal and spain are different countries with a different culture and language and the people from there, today, are both seen as white.
But they form an immigrant group in the US that is perceived as a block and has a somewhat common identity because they, by now, mostly come from south america.

But the same is true about muslims in the US. They are a group that is lumped together (you hardly differentiate between different middle eastern countries even if they have a starkly different culture), they have a somewhat common identity and they share many similarities.

I hope i could clear up your confusion."
94,fiim0uq,"I can appreciate you looking into something and changing your opinion based on evidence. Not super common these days. 

I totally get the knee-jerk reaction myself as well. Nazis have a way of poisoning the well when it comes to certain topics, and it makes it difficult to criticize a state such as Israel (which truly does some terrible shit) without it sounding like you're criticizing a people. Jewish folks are just folks, and none of the people who are Jewish over in my neck of the woods have ever shot a Palestinian kid or sterilized immigrants against their will that I'm aware of. And I'm like 100% sure none of them are plotting to breed out the ""white race"" or whatever nonsense Nazis come up with."

96,fftksoj,"This is one of those articles where the over-the-top style actually hurts its ability to get its point across.

I mean, a title like ""The Hidden Agenda behind Interracial Pornography""? Boom, you just lost 99% of everyone who wasn't already on board with what you're trying to say. 

And glancing at the rest of the article, most people will just yell 'antisemitism' and dismiss both the author and the site this is posted on.

Yet upon closer inspection, the article brings up some pretty salient points. There really is something iconoclastic about black-on-white interracial porn - but again, the way he's framing it isn't going to convince anyone who didn't already agree with him in the first place.

By the way; the notion that porn can be demeaning, racist, or even colonial is nothing new. There's been plenty of feminist and postcolonialist literature that argues that porn not only fosters demeaning attitudes to women, but also that stuff like white male on Asian/""brown"" female promotes racist/colonial hierarchies.

If you actually want to reach the people who _do_ need convincing, then that's the framework you'll need to adopt. Use the lingo of the college liberals. Use terms from sociology, feminism and postcolonial studies; they're much more suitable for this than you might think.

As for the points about the Jews in porn...

Most of the points he made were decent on their own, but they're not going to convince a skeptic. 

I mean, Al Goldstein? Sure, he really did say those things. But he was also a fat maladjusted degenerate who died alone and in poverty. People will just say ""Well, he wasn't exactly normal by Jewish standards either, anyway.""

Mindgeek, i.e. the company that owns YouPorn, Pornhub, xHamster, etc., is owned by American Jews? Eh, Jews in Western Europe and America have always been a highly urban minority anyway - and urbanites are always overrepresented in the movie industry, theatre, and their (even) seedier cohorts like the porn industry. Other urban immigrant communities like the Armenians and the Italians are also overrepresented in those sectors.

...but then there was the Nathan Abrams quote.

&gt;Nathan Abrams, Jewish professor at the university of Aberdeen in Scotland narrows down the rule of the Jews in pornography (emphasis mine) :
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Jews are the driving force behind the modern pornographic industry and their motivation is, in part, to destroy gentile morals.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; […]
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Pornography thus becomes a way of defiling Christian culture and, as it penetrates to the very heart of the American mainstream (and is no doubt consumed by those very same WASPs), its subversive character becomes more charged. … Extending the subversive thesis, Jewish involvement in the X-rated industry can be seen as a proverbial two fingers (Middle finger for American readers) to the entire WASP establishment in America.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; […]
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Jewish involvement in porn, by this argument, is the result of an atavistic hatred of Christian authority: they are trying to weaken the dominant culture in America by moral subversion.”

Jean-Batave then still screws up by failing to actually mention _where that quote is from_. He doesn't even mention the title, let alone the page number. That's an elementary mistake if there ever was one.

I did manage to find the article, though: _Tripe Exthnics_, from the Jewish Quarterly. 
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0449010X.2004.10706874

Nonetheless, this _is_ a good argument. This is a Jewish academic from Britain who matter-of-factly that irreligious American Jews not only had a very serious impact on the American porn industry, but that they also often had rather bigoted attitudes towards Christianity and mainstream society - and that they were all too happy to use their porn to 'stick it to the man'.

This - this right here - is something that your average Twitter Jew will flat-out dismiss as an antisemitic conspiracy theory. But here we have a Jewish university professor in media studies who spells out for us why it's true.

That being said; context matters, though. Not all the people who hate Christianity and mainstream Western society are Jewish - not by a long shot. There's more than a few Jews who really do understand that hate is not OK and that the West is actually a pretty great place to live. 

And there's also plenty of 100% gentile feminists and Marxists who virulently hate Christianity and mainstream society. In fact, it's really no coincidence that the most toxic Jewish individuals are, without a fault, also hardcore leftwing. It's often leftwing ideology that turns a passive dislike of mainstream society into an active hatred.

And let's face it - feminists and Marxists want to subvert mainstream Western society too. And they've been working very hard to achieve that. That's a part of the bigger picture that's also very relevant when it comes to the kinds of porn et al that are being pushed, and Jean-Batave failed to illustrate that."
97,fic4fwt,"Ok, so I'm responding from the waiting room at my mechanic's shop, which means I don't have access to all the resources/references I'd like to have at my disposal to fact check myself. But, just based on my personal experience, I'll try to address your points. I feel like I should mention for context that while I grew up relatively steeped in religious observance and received an unusually deep and comprehensive religious education in comparison with a majority of U.S. Jews, I have been essentially non-practising since about age 14, for the last 3 decades, have identified as a cultural/ethnic, rather than religious, Jew ... for whatever context that's worth. 

&gt; the main one I find pressing on me, and in reference to the webpage I posted, is the lack of Jewish voice on the subject.

I guess I should say 1st that historically and culturally, there is no such thing as a single unified or consensus voice regarding questions of dogma and practice. 

In fact, there's a very old saying that is a common refrain within the Jewish community: **""2 Jews, 3 opinions.""** It's a typically self-deprecating reference to the longstanding tradition of (rabbinical) debate and the contentious nature of coming to consensus in Jewish culture. 

I say all of that to say that there isn't any truly official answer or stance for *all* of Judaism on any question, and there isn't necessarily one even for a single branch, so there's no way for me -- some random member of the community -- to offer any answers that will be generalizeable or universally applicable, or even representative of anything other than my own specific experience in Conservative congregations located in densely populated suburbs of a large mid-atlantic metropolitan area.  /disclaimer

Getting back to the question of how prominent (or not) the voice of the Jewish community is within the greater public discourse around reproductive rights, though, a fundamental difference in doctrine between Christianity and Judaism becomes central to the answer. Christianity holds that adherents have a duty to ""spread the good news"" in an effort to convert others to the faith, because to do otherwise is to abandon their eternal souls to fiery damnation. To *not* attempt to convince others to ""accept Jesus"" is to condemn them to the most horrific fate. Judaism, on the other hand, *strictly* prohibits prosletyzing; it is deeply taboo to attempt to burden other people with one's personal religious beliefs. 
Another related issue is the question of whether or not there is ""one true way"" to find God's favor. Most Christians interpret certain New Testament verses (John 14:6 in particular) to mean that there indeed is only one way to ""salvation,"" *i.e.*, Christianity. In contrast, Judaism does not teach that a person's faith excludes them from earning God's favor -- in this or the next life.

These dichotomies manifest, among other ways, as very divergent cultural norms around the appropriate role of religious values in public law and policy. 

Because Christians believe they have an obligation to make others into adherents of their faith (with the ultimate goal of Christianizing the world so it may be saved), *and* believe that their way is objectively the ""correct"" way, they also tend to believe that it is perfectly sensible and acceptable to enshrine their religious values and tenets into law -- and to impose them on the inferior sinners who are ultimately going to hell anyway, regardless of their consent to be so goverened. IMO, this grotesquely paternalistic, moralistic orientation is at the root of a whole lot of the difficulties regressives seem to have with issues involving the consent and bodily autonomy of members outgroups.

To be completely honest, this blithe, sometimes indignant, willingness of Christians to impose their subjective beliefs and values onto others as though they are objectively superior and correct -- especially by using the institutions of our secular government to do so -- is regarded by most Jewish people as shockingly immoral, not to mention arrogant and contemptible. (This doesn't mean, of course, that Jews don't have a long, rich history of working to see their religious and ethical values reflected in the laws and values of the societies they have called home, but not in such a way as to *impose* those values, and more importantly *practices*, on others.)

So in part, I think what you perceive as insufficient volume about reproductive freedom from the Jewish community is about that difference in perspective about what is an appropriate level of religious entanglement with law and politics.  And this is an important point, I think -- it's not that Jewish people are less staunchly pro-choice, it's that there's a distinction drawn between what one should do in terms of personal values, ethics, and practice and telling *others* to do the same, especially using governmental authority.

My other response is that while their social justice work on other issues has perhaps been more visible, Jewish groups have been organizing and working to ensure women's access to abortion since before *Roe*.

From the Summer 1986 issue of *Lilith* magazine: [""Jewish Organizations Vocal in Their Support of Pro-Choice""](https://www.lilith.org/articles/jewish-organizations-vocal-in-their-support-of-pro-choice/)

&gt; B’nai B’rith Women, the National Council of Jewish Women and the American Jewish Congress have gone on record as vocal opponents of President Reagan’s recent attempt to induce the Supreme Court to overturn its 1973 ruling legalizing abortion.

And this *Ha'aretz* article is much more recent: [""The Jewish Women Leading the Resistance in the U.S. Battle Over Abortion""](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-the-jewish-women-leading-the-resistance-in-the-u-s-battle-over-abortion-1.6545400)

It explains the historical role of Jewish people -- non-Orthodox Jewish women in particular -- in the battle for reproductive rights in the U.S. as a backdrop for discussing their involvement in attempting to thwart the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh:

&gt; According to most interpretations, Judaism views abortion differently than Catholicism or conservative evangelical Christianity, which both consider conception the start of full personhood. In contrast, that status isn’t conferred until a baby has begun to emerge, according to many decisors of Jewish law.

&gt; **This, coupled with American Judaism’s history of engagement with social justice issues, may be why most – though not all – abortion-access support groups in the United States were started and are run by non-Orthodox Jewish women, activists say. And while midwives have no doubt always helped friends and family members end pregnancies when needed, the creator of the first organized abortion-access network in America was a Jewish woman: Heather Booth.**

That's just the tip of the iceberg. The rest of the article is an excellent read; I highly recommend it for a much fuller picture of the role of Jewish women as leaders in the organized effort for abortion rights.

I guess, then, what I'm saying overall is that although Jewish people tend to be more circumspect about loudly insisting that public laws be modeled after their specific dogmatic idiosyncracies, that is quite different from a ""refusal to take a stand"". In fact, as with most social justice issues, Jewish Americans (very often poor, immigrant Jewish Americans) have been at the forefront of direct action and movement organizing."
98,fie3ifd,"Labeling the core issue here as a matter between White Nationalists and the Jewish community is a little bit of a red herring. Its important to understand that the real issue is under the surface (especially among White (American) Nationalists). This is NOT about the Jewish community or the Jewish faith. There should be no confusion. The real issue is that there are something like 4 million dual national Israeli-Americans (who also happen to be Jewish), but whose main allegiance is NOT the U.S., but to Israel. They vote in both countries. And among this group are 100 Billionaires, more than half of all doctors, and senior partners in law firms etc. and in essence they control U.S. politics (and economics) to a very large extent. They control almost 2/3rd of US financial assets. And ALL of this is at play for the simple purpose of supporting NOT the U.S., but another state - i.e. Israel. U.S. has become a vassal state. And anyone that dares make any sort of a comment about it, gets shut down.  Politicians are scared. Its horrific. White (American) Nationalists are simply the ones being vocal about it, and they strongly believe they have lost control of their countries, communities, businesses etc. They are being manipulated and pointed towards hating Hispanics, immigrants, Muslims, etc. when increasingly they have figured out that the real issue is Israel's total control of America. You have one of those billionaire Bloomberg and Bernie both undermining Joe Biden, you have Trump/Kushner cabal in the Whitehouse.  This is a serious issue.  As a friend of the Jewish community, and someone that does not support hatred of any kind, I am trying to help people understand the core issue - so that active steps can be taken to address this situation. My fear is that this sort of nationalism will spill over into the mainstream - and it will lead to a situation not too different to Germany in the 30's. Its not very sustainable for everyone. When for example, the truth about 9/11 spills out, or when the level of control being exercised becomes more visible (like what is going on in the Democratic Primaries) - it will lead to a major push back. This is not good for everyone. But its NOT a religious issue, but a political issue involving the state of Israel. Israeli interference in the U.S. is no joke.  I implore my wonderful Jewish friends to understand the true issue here and address it. Israel has gone rogue."
99,ffvv9oi,"I personally think a lot of it has to do with how insulated the jewish community is. There's some statistic that says a dollar brought into a Jewish household stays in the jewish community longer than a dollar brought into any other group.

You can find the same kind of thing going on with Mormons in Utah, immigrant communities, and lots of other groups.

I feel like its pretty unamerican to be insular like that, but thats just me."
100,fg0g22z,"This is an interesting topic for me since I’m an Armenian (born in Armenia) and have lived in the diaspora for over 30 years.

I’ve always thought they were a lot of similarities between Armenian and Jewish cultures. But one thing that always struck me was that the Jewish community is more supportive of each other. My family moved to the US in the early 90s and within the Armenian community, those with the means to help weren’t very supportive of newcomers. By support I don’t mean financial but things like finding a job, learning how to get around the bureaucracy. 

I’ve observed that within my culture there’s this unhealthy competition amongst each other. If one person is doing well, another tries to take them down. So instead of lifting each other up, it’s the opposite.

I also witnessed how the Jewish community is with each other. I’ve seen how they come together to welcome immigrants. And I’ve seen a lot support for each other within the community. 

The takeaway is that the Armenian community in the diaspora isn’t as organized and supportive each other. We don’t lift each other up. Maybe others have had a different experience but this has been mine and what I’ve observed."
101,fgjnsnl,"Well the orthodox jewish community is rapidly growing and expanding. American born jews are still here (yo!). since the fall of the soviet union, we had an influx of Jews from the former soviet states, who settled in Brighton Beach, and Queens. They still retain many of their old traditions. Orthodox jews are outpacing secular jews in terms of population growth. If you walk around NYC, you might run into a couple of Chabadnik boys asking if you're jewish, so they can perform the ritual with the phylacteries.

Irish culture isn't as big as it was, but it is still concentrated in some areas. Rockaway Beach in Queens, and Katonah ave in the Bronx still have big Irish diasporas, I think Woodside Queens does too. Every storr along Katonah ave is Emerald or Erin!! Lolol 

Little Italy in Manhattan had been reduced significantly, as China town has expanded, but you can still find important Italian areas. although East Harlem has lost most of its Italian heritage, it still thrives in parts of the Bronx, Bensonhurst brooklyn, and staten island. East Harlem Harlem stil has some relics from it Italian years. Bensonhurst used to have a larger Italian population, but many left. Now the area is being settled by Chinese, vietnamese and other Asian immigrants. 

At one point, many Jews, Irish, Italians, and others, who arrived in NYC through Ellis Island, eventually moved out to the suburbs. Basically the real estate developers did something called: ""block busting"", where they scared people into leaving to the suburbs. this allowed for new populations to replace those who fled. 

Nevertheless, NYC still has a few Italian Catholic public feasts each year that are huge. The st Patty's day parade is still very big. There is also one in  Rockaway that is very popular. 

I don't think the heritage of those 3 groups will ever go away, but i think that that holds true for every immigrant group that makes nyc home. Almost 40 years since the first Russians trickled into Brighton, and every new store *still* has Russian signs! The hayday of Ellis Islanders may be long gone, but every new immigrant group creates their own NYC heritage."
102,f7lzje1,"&gt;Both are actively taking actions to remove a certain population or culture from the region. We can agree that's bad, right?

Yes, we can agree that is bad.

Here in the US, we are being subjected to mass immigration that we never asked for. This is against our will. Although we are not forced from our homes, this has indirectly forced many from their homes in a phenomenon known as white flight. 

&gt;Italian families have different culture from Irish families, who have different culture from a Swedish family, who have different culture from a Jewish family. Is that problematic for the future of our country?

Most of those groups from Europe melted down into a new ethnic group, the (white) Americans. There are some exceptions, such as the Amish, some Jews, and some Italians, but most of them come from many backgrounds and their culture is far more similar to their fellow Americans than to the various cultures of their ancestors. 

&gt;To that end, what would American White culture look like? 

You can do this with any culture. Is there really any such thing as American black culture? West Coast black culture, east coast black culture, southern black culture, and rural vs. urban black cultures all exist. We can see that there is something we can refer to as black culture though too. They are part of a greater whole.

&gt;And yet, I have 2nd generation minority friends who behave exactly the same as my ""American"" friends, but for some reason I should be worried if too many more like him turn up?

Yes. I have friends who are immigrants and the descendants of recent immigrants too. That does not mean I deny that increased diversity often results in tragedy and mass immigration is drastically transforming the nation into something else."

**Title**: Calling the Shots: The 2019 Measles Outbreak and Immunization Rates in New York City Schools

**Abstract**: Following a 2019 measles outbreak in New York City, we examined which particular neighborhoods outbreaks occurred in, relevant demographic information, and school vaccination rates. This study is applicable for helping medical professionals prepare ahead of time in case of future outbreaks and for educating the affected populations in the future.

**Background and Introduction**: In 2019, the United States experienced the worst measles outbreak in 25 years. The disease had been eradicated in the U.S. in 2000; however, 1,261 cases were reported throughout the country this year, with over 75% of these cases linked to outbreaks in New York. Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease, spread through airborne pathogens by coughing or sneezing. Children under the age of five and adults older than twenty are most prone to contracting measles. One out of four people with measles will be hospitalized. Measles can lead to complications including pneumonia, encephalitis, or even death. People traveling internationally have been the main source of bringing the disease back to the U.S, and the virus spreads rapidly within close-knit and traditional communities with low rates of vaccination. Furthermore, several groups have pushed anti-vaccination rhetoric, claiming vaccines lead to injuries, cause autism, or contain ingredients that violate religious law, despite there being no scientific evidence supporting these statements.

**Hypotheses**: We predict that New York City neighborhoods with higher levels of immunization exemptions and lower levels of immunization rates in schools will be more at risk of being near a measles outbreak because they lack the presence of herd immunity protecting those who are vulnerable to the disease. We also predict that the outbreak cases occurred in locations with young children, as they more easily contract the disease.

**Data and Methods**: School immunization data was retrieved from the New York State Department of Health for the 2018-19 school year. The School Immunization Survey collects aggregate data from schools in New York State regarding the immunization status of all the students attending school. All schools, excluding New York City public schools, have reported the immunization status of all students in grades kindergarten through 12. Population and age data was retrieved from the United States Census. 

We used ArcGIS to overlay New York City Block Group Data with the US Census demographic information. We then geocoded New York State school immunization records to obtain point data, and selected all the schools with less than 95% percent of the students vaccinated and exported them to a new file. We gave each point a ½ mile buffer and overlaid them with the New York City Neighborhood data and the measles case data. We reclassified all the schools with religious or medical exemption data so that we could display where the exemptions most frequently occurred. After looking at the locations of the outbreaks we examined our data to look for patterns. 

**Map 1**. Measles Outbreaks in New York City: 473 measles cases were reported in Williamsburg and 121 cases were reported in Borough Park. The majority of neighborhoods reported few, if any, cases. Schools with under 95% of students vaccinated due to religious exemptions are noted by red points and medical exemptions are noted by blue points. Exemptions appear to be concentrated in the Williamsburg and Borough Park neighborhoods.

**Map 2**. Children Under 5 Years-Old in Brooklyn: The number of children under five years-old in Brooklyn are identified above by block group. The majority of cases in the 2019 outbreak occurred where children under the age of five are more densely concentrated. The largest populations of children under five are in Williamsburg and Borough Park, the locations of the two largest outbreaks.

**Map 3**. Schools with Under 95% of Students Vaccinated: Five neighborhoods reported having under 95% of students vaccinated at between 15 and 24 schools. The two neighborhoods with the most unvaccinated schools were located in both Williamsburg and Borough Park. Locations near these two neighborhoods also had more schools with less than 95% of the students vaccinated.

**Conclusion**: 649 cases of measles were reported in New York, with 525 (81%) of cases occurring in children under 18. Most come from ultra-Orthodox Jewish families in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg and Borough Park neighborhoods. Because many of these children attend religious private schools where they are more likely to receive religious exemptions to state vaccination requirements, we identified schools with immunization rates below 95% (Map 1), and the neighborhoods where most of these schools were located (Map 3). Ninety-five percent vaccinated is considered the threshold in order to achieve community (herd) immunity. Vulnerable populations such as infants, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals rely on herd immunity to protect them from contracting contagious diseases. Additionally, these highly infected areas had greater concentrations of young children (Map 2), which puts them at a greater risk of becoming the center of new outbreaks until vaccination rates increase significantly.

**Limitations and Future Research**: We were unable to access point data for each measles outbreak case that occurred, as this information is not readily available. As for future research, in June of 2019, New York State removed religious exemptions from school vaccination requirements for children. Given this change, research can be conducted for the 2019-2020 school year to examine how the removal of non-medical exemptions affected total vaccination rates, and whether more parents will start homeschooling their children to avoid vaccination requirements. Future research can also be conducted on viral outbreaks that occurred among other close-knit groups, such as the Amish in Ohio, Somali-Americans in Minnesota, and, Russian-language immigrants in Washington, to see how vaccine education and information can be accurately spread throughout the traditional communities.

If any population is only 0.05% of the populace of this country they are politically irrelevant. The whole point is it isn't a large group of people, and why the hell is them being jewish even relevant in the first place, it isn't, unless as a collective they are supporting interest completely disproportionate to the level they should be by populace in this country. 

If they is the case they should be told to bugger off. Facts are the Jewish community isn't poor, impoverished, ill educated, lacking social services, it is pretty well off, for historic reasons. They shouldn't be getting any sort of special treatment because they don't need it, yet that is what they want. How do we know this? Because for some reason a populace that makes up 0.05% of this country is apparently politically relevant.

The Jewish community is an insular one and can be talked about as an entity, just like the Jamaican or Bangladeshi one is (actually these groups aren't that insular at all), the difference is unlike most immigrant communities who have joined together based off past/present culture in a new country, they aren't poor, they aren't under represented in society, they aren't in need of help or special treatment. 

You don't get special treatment just because there are few of you, you get it because you as a grouping, are deprived of resources, often because you up and left your country to make a better life. That is not the case of the Jewish community, they are entrenched in the upper echelons of this country trying to sway decisions far over reaching their populace. That shouldn't be allowed by any group, and in the same manner, other groups shouldn't be under represented. 

Then you can add the fact this country is one of the biggest arms dealers in the world and Israel, the apparent Jewish state, is a complete war monger, the fact Jewish people aren't denouncing Israel on mass is questionable at best."

That shouldn't be allowed by any group, and in the same manner, other groups shouldn't be under represented.

Both of those are historically displaced/pseudo-nomadic peoples, i.e. people who lack a homeland. In other words, they're *immigrants.* Those are the examples that most readily come to mind for you because:  

1. Europeans have been racist against them for centuries, edging into millennia, and  

2. they've always been geopolitically weak groups with very little political power, which means the racism can't be popularly excused in modern times with ""omg they're gonna take overrrrrr"" the way anti-Muslim bigotry is still be excused. The same fearmongering about the evil outsider takeover and implosion of Our Good Society has, of course, been used in the past against both Jews and Romani.

3)You linked an article saying how non jewish illegal african immigrants are being deported and that israel is hiring people to look for them because of an apparent lack of manpower. They never claimed to be jewish and no one is conducting dna tests on them. That's the second time you showed that you're unable to read and judge articles by their titles.

4)Now you linked a very emotional article filled with loaded words about an unrelated story where an actual (apparently) jewish family is having trouble with bureaucracy because of racism (and even then, woah, right wing governments are racist?

There will always be exceptions of course (the Balkan countries probably don’t follow this rule; Jewish individuals are another case where this will not hold; and the large amount of immigrants from the Middle East and Africa that have arrived over the last three decades) but I will say that statement is generally true for most of the European populace. 


However, if you test the same fourth or fifth generation of Americans, you will find the *majority* of ancestors for the *majority* of the populace will not have been US citizens.

If you look at drug crime statistics, you’d think black people do the most drugs. But reality is that an overwhelming majority of drug users are white. You’re using the results of a white supremacist country applying white supremacist policy as proof of black mediocrity. You’re a joke. This is the epitome of bad logical reasoning, and a terrible foundation for scientific thinking. The way that you think is flawed. 

Further, youre riding on the coat tails of other Jews. The Jew who wrote that article actually put in the work in his field. Racists like you claim the works of other people.

Lol nah fam, it don’t work like that. 


You’re of low intelligence. I can tell just by your perspectives that you are disconnected from reality. Part of me empathizes with you. I know your people went through a lot and it’s easy to get defensive and start  adopting the mechanisms of your oppressors in an attempt to protect yourself. But you’ve gotten lost in the sauce bro. It’s embarrassing. Jews aren’t better than anyone else, nor are they worse inherently. The us funds the Israeli government to a degree that it’s able to offer its citizens things even us citizens don’t have access to. Plus the Jewish community is very good about keeping the money within the community. There is wealth in the Jewish community because people took pity on you. Jewish children around the world get free trips to Israel, free camp, huge networking opportunities because people who pity you guys pour a lot of money into your communities. Worst things have happened to other peoples and the results are not the same. It’s good on you guys for keeping your community tight and supporting each other. Some say thats racist, but I say that’s moving smart. Where you get racist is when you act like you’re inherently better than anyone else. That’s when you become embarrassingly idiotic. Y’all have a tendency to be racist because you’ve been exposed to a lot of racism, I get it. But white people depicted your kind the same as they have mine: animal like. White people who support racism are dumb for racism. You’re double dumb because you’re a victim of it, and then you still support it.

Listen, even Asian students with lower iq tend to do better in school than white people with higher iq. It comes down to culture (a reminder that African students do even better than those Asian students in successful achievement of higher education). The very validity of iq tests are in question, but even assuming they are valid, there is no proof according to the overwhelming majority of the scientific community, that they show that race determines intelligence. Racists have been trying to say this for hundreds of years. If there was proof, there would be a consensus. But there isn’t. If you were concerned about science, instead of feeling good about yourself (I’m assuming you haven’t accomplished much in your life on your own and you’ve kinda put all your pride eggs into this one basket) then you would try to figure out *why* this topic is widely denounced by scientists and why there is no consensus. It’s not because scientists are concerned with political correctness, it’s because they are concerned with the requirements of a valid experiment: what are the controls, what factors are at play, etc.,  Studies have shown that children who take tests can be broken down into many categories, one of the most definitive? Poverty. For example, consider those children who qualify for free lunch programs vs those who do not (implying home income levels). Consistently, the kids who do not qualify for the free lunch option score better on exams. In fact, African immigrant girls who do not qualify for the free lunch programs score better than white boys and girls who do not qualify for the free lunch programs. Meaning with income controlled, African girls consistently score better than all white people. There are many things at play, it could be the culture of studying and placing importance on education, etc., Humans are very complex. And respectable *reputable* scientists understand this and how shallow the concept of race is. 

You, on the other hand, jump to race as the answer. It’s always been a distraction. It always will be. And your people know intimately well how shitty things can go when you allow racism to define your policies and outlooks.

But carry on. I’m over this exchange. The research is out there. If you want to find people who hate blacks, you will. Those people always want to support their unsupportable hate with “facts”. In reality, the only fact is that you are a racist. And at the very least, that means you’re so dumb that you ascribe to a shitty method of categorizing people.

What do you mean by 'knock against them'? The reason the law is written the way it is, is so that any Jew can turn to Israel for refuge and anyone considered a Jew. I've not heard of a solely genetic claim being made; that's not to say it could be. The definition of ""jewish"" as applied by our high Court is very broad, i.e. you do not have to be halachically Jewish. 

Ive done this as a convert to Judaism. Im ethnically half eastern-european by descent so I look like a typical slavic immigrant. As a convert, my practicing Judaism exclusively and becoming part of the wider Jewish community is how I became entitled. Because as a Jew, I could (have had) experienced antisemitism. My practice of the faith is more central to my jewishness but it doesnt have to be that way. 
The laws were written to protect Jews. Period. There are a lot of kinds of Jews who have made aliyah, including from Ethiopia and other parts of Africa and Arabia; when those countries became so hostile to their Jewish citizens. In the case of Yemen, they were being de-naturalised as NATIVE born citizens because of their faith. In Ethiopia it became known as an ""aliyah of rescue."" 

It is basically interpreted as if you would be considered Jewish according to the Nuremburg Laws which characterized more than a few practicing Christians or even more stoutly atheistic and secular Germans with Jewish ancestry. There is no discrimination if you are Jewish by blood. But if you became Jewish, entitled to aliyah, like a spouse, and de-convert/ stop practicing judaism after divorce; your eligibility would end. 

You can be a secular/atheist Jew or devoutly religious; you're still a Jew in the eyes of the law. You just have to prove a connection, blood is lasting. Conversions arent necessarily."

122,egj2sm5,"Data until 2017  
https://i.imgur.com/KHOSKgu.png

The data about antisemitic incidents is inherently noisy. Especially the relative change of violent incidents is always. The absolute numbers are still very low and a few incidents more or less lead to dramatic sounding relative changes.  
As you can see, the figures for 2018 are in the ballpark of the one in 2014 with several years before that having significantly higher numbers.  
62 violent incidents is high, but 2007 had more such incidents.  
The data is also not normalized to the number of citizens or the number of Jewish people.

I'd say that there is a new data point for 2018 for these statistics, but looking at the past, it isn't time to read some dramatic trends into it. The noise and fluctuations are quite high, so I doubt that the data supports the notion of a statistically significant rise. It is certainly nothing to be alarmed about.  
It should also be noted that there is no obvious connection to immigrants. The number of incidents didn't jump up after 2015.

PS: Also, in the video they say the Jewish community is growing. Statistics from the Zentralrat der Juden shows that the number of members in Jewish congregations is constantly declining since 2006. But IDK if there are more Jews without official memberships.
"
123,e8k4l8q,"You raise a real question with an actual historical answer, though.

The problem with men being the majority in leadership positions is that it happened because women were excluded from these positions deliberately. Nowadays, deliberate exclusion is less common, but societal factors (""women should be moms,"" stereotyping that ""women are too emotional,"" etc) still discourage women from these positions. All of this is to say, the male majority in business leadership positions a product of gender discrimination and its legacies.

Jewish folks are prominent in economics and in entertainment in part because, historically, those jobs were looked down on by white Christians. Early movie-making and banking in particular were not considered reputable work, so many white Christians stayed out of those fields and spoke badly of those who worked in them. But there was still a demand for these things, and Jewish men and women were able to enter these industries where they would face less competition and no more discrimination than they already faced. (That is to say, if folks already look down on you, what does it matter if you enter an industry that people look down on? They weren't going to beat antisemitism by taking ""respectable"" jobs. Racism/religious prejudice doesn't work on that kind of logic). Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice gets at this some, too: Christians looked down on banking/lending with interest, but the fact remains that sometimes those Christians needed loans. Somebody needed to fill that role. 

With Hollywood, there are other factors, of course: silent film allowed immigrants a space to perform without having to speak English well, unlike theatre/Broadway. And many immigrants were just hungry to succeed no matter what, so they didn't care about the disreputability of film as an occupation. Many of those early folks had families who then grew up in the industry, knowing the ins and outs, then went to school with those industries in mind, etc. Thus there were/are lots of prominent Jewish leaders in Hollywood and the economic sector. 

Here's the big difference: neither banking nor Hollywood excluded white Christians in the deliberate kind of way that the business world excluded women (though Hollywood was/is still racist, and banking today is still super white)."
124,eam7hj9,"&gt; I'm not Jewish, so I will stop trying to speak for them now, but my gut is telling me this is a horrible comparison. Why don't you post in r/Judaism and ask them if they think this is a fair comparison? 

Why don’t you? The Jewish community is far more supportive of immigrant rights and the right to asylum than other groups because they know to well what ignoring that right can lead to. Honestly it’s an incredibly on point comparison and the Jewish community will often be the first to say that because it was the injustice brought upon them that makes this today so unacceptable.

125,e88w475,"Replying pretty much in an attempt to derail the thread from going where it is inevitably going to head:

The big advantage in admission to Harvard and the like goes primarily to the ""aristocracy.""  In England, this would be much clearer, and no-one would really doubt what was meant.  There is no formal test for the aristocracy, but everyone can tell who is or isn't a member.  It is not required that you go to the right schools, are members of the right clubs, have the right hobbies, occupations, surnames, etc. but the cluster is completely well defined, and very few people would disagree on whether a central member was included or not.

In America, the aristocracy is less well understood, and there is a tendency to confuse it with certain ethnic groups.  This, in general, is wrong, as, I my experience, there is a significant difference between membership in one of the two ethnic groups that make up the old aristocracy, WASP and Jewish people, and actually being in the in-crowd.  The average middle class suburban Jewish family is not part of the Harvard going set, and neither is the average middle class suburban WASP family, no matter how storied their pedigree.  

A clear recent change to the aristocracy is the addition of three new groups.  With recent immigration, other countries have sent their old aristocrats, in strong contrast to past immigration from Italy, Ireland, and Eastern Europe, where the top of society did not emigrate.  The top of Iranian society moved in the 70s, and they are firmly ensconced at the top of modern US society.  Later arrivals include Indian immigrants, especially to the West Coast, and later still are Chinese.  These arrivals understood the levers of power in their home country and easily adapted to high society in America, slotting in with the old WASP elite, and that part of Jewish society that had already joined.  

I expect the response that these people deserve power, as their ancestors proved they were better, and thus became richer.  I doubt this, as I have the European attitude that all the rich got that way by being evil.  This is a fairly accurate description to how people gained fortunes pre-1900.  To be rich was to have accumulated riches from others, through plain wickedness, as life was a zero sum game.  In the US, the rich are considered to be made up of people who created new wealth, and this is true to some degree. However, the aristocracy is not primarily made up of self made men at all, but rather those who know how to work the system.

At this point I should also point out that the OP leaves out the two main ways White Gentiles get into Harvard.  10% of Harvard is the Dean's list, which though it is increasingly Chinese, is majority White, so perhaps 5% white gentile. 10% of Harvard is recruited athletes who are almost entirely (80%+) white gentiles.  Adding these together leaves 3% of Harvard as white gentiles that are admitted for academic reasons, or probably within margin of error.  This makes me doubt the analysis, as it seems unlikely that in some years Harvard admits no white gentiles for academic reasons.

A good test of whether or not someone is a member of the aristocracy is their name.  An Irish, Italian, or Polish name, all of which are very recognizable, is a sure good sign that someone is not a member of the elite.  As one might expect, there are relatively few of these in Harvard, despite Boston being a traditionally Irish town.

Living in America, it is quite easy to believe that there is no aristocracy, but for me what alerted me to this relatively small group of, actually very diverse people, was someone I once hired.  They were a scion of a now deposed royal family, and quite bizarrely seemed to know absolutely everyone.  I would have been certain they were just name dropping, save for the invitations to royal weddings, Cabinet members dropping by, being on first name terms with heads of state, and causally being able to call up random Fortune 50 CEOs, the old companies.  There is an elite in the US, and, almost certainly, you are not in it."
126,e8mr8wy,"&gt; Eleven members of the Pittsburgh affiliate of Bend the Arc: A Jewish Partnership for Justice penned a letter to Trump following the Saturday shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue.
&gt; 
&gt; “Our Jewish community is not the only group you have targeted,” the group wrote. “You have also deliberately undermined the safety of people of color, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Yesterday’s massacre is not the first act of terror you incited against a minority group in our country.” ...
&gt; 
&gt; The group also said Trump is not welcome in the city until he also stops targeting minorities, immigrants and refugees.
&gt; 
&gt; The president has “spread lies and sowed fear about migrant families in Central America,” the group wrote.
&gt; 
&gt; “The Torah teaches that every human being is made b’tzelem Elohim, in the image of God. This means all of us,” the leaders wrote. “In our neighbors, Americans, and people worldwide who have reached out to give our community strength, there we find the image of God.” ...
&gt; 
&gt; “Here in Mr. Rogers’ neighborhood, we express gratitude for the first responders and for the outpouring of support from our neighbors near and far,” they wrote.

Can't have anything but respect for them for taking such a courageous, bold stand especially in the wake of this tragedy and the fear of some other radicalized right-winger going off and a similar attack. Everything they've said is absolutely right and the immediate way Trump took to appealing to nuts spreading false flag, anti-media, and anti-Democratic conspiracies about the attack shows just how hollow the few pithy words he did say in condemnation were.

&gt; President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you stop targeting and endangering all minorities.
&gt; 
&gt; The murderer’s last public statement invoked the compassionate work of the Jewish refugee service HIAS at the end of a week in which you spread lies and sowed fear about migrant families in Central America. He killed Jews in order to undermine the efforts of all those who find shared humanity with immigrants and refugees.

Hard to say how influential this group is as there's not a ton of Google hits on them if you set your search for before yesterday. Here's [a write up](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/18/bend-the-arc-jewish-israel_n_1681546.html) in the Huffington Post about them. "
128,e8nva16,"&gt; More than 16,000 people have signed an open letter to President Trump from the leaders of a Pittsburgh-based Jewish group who say the president will not be welcome in the city unless he denounces white nationalism and stops “targeting” minorities after a mass shooting Saturday at a local synagogue left 11 dead.
&gt; 
&gt; The letter, which was published and shared on Sunday, was written by 11 members of the Pittsburgh affiliate of Bend the Arc, a national organization for progressive Jews focused on social justice, following what is being called the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. The shooting at Tree of Life synagogue also left several people injured, including law enforcement. As of early Monday morning, the letter had 16,533 signatures.
&gt; 
&gt; “For the past three years your words and your policies have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,” the Jewish leaders wrote. “You yourself called the murderer evil, but yesterday’s violence is the direct culmination of your influence.""
&gt; 
&gt; The letter continued: “Our Jewish community is not the only group you have targeted. You have also deliberately undermined the safety of people of color, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Yesterday’s massacre is not the first act of terror you incited against a minority group in our country.”
&gt; 
&gt; The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment late Sunday night.
&gt; 
&gt; On Saturday, Trump strongly condemned the shooting as “pure evil,” adding that the “vile, hate-filled poison of anti-Semitism” and all other forms of prejudice must be rejected, The Washington Post reported. The president also announced that he would be making a visit to Pittsburgh.

&gt;  All of America is in mourning over the mass murder of Jewish Americans at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We pray for those who perished and their loved ones, and our hearts go out to the brave police officers who sustained serious injuries...
&gt; 
&gt; @realDonaldTrump
&gt; ...This evil Anti-Semitic attack is an assault on humanity. It will take all of us working together to extract the poison of Anti-Semitism from our world. We must unite to conquer hate.
&gt; 
&gt; The news of the president’s possible travel plans did not sit well with Joshua Friedman, who is one of the leaders of Bend the Arc’s Pittsburgh chapter.
&gt; 
&gt; “My immediate reaction was he is not welcome here,” Friedman, who does not attend services at Tree of Life, told The Post in a Sunday phone interview. “I immediately wrote to the rest of our steering committee that he is not welcome, we have to make that clear.”
&gt; 
&gt; Four boldfaced lines stand out from the rest of the letter’s 338 words.
&gt; 
&gt; “President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism.”
&gt; 
&gt; “President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you stop targeting and endangering all minorities.”
&gt; 
&gt; “President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you cease your assault on immigrants and refugees.”
&gt; 
&gt; “President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you commit yourself to compassionate, democratic policies that recognize the dignity of all of us.”
&gt; 
&gt; Bend the Arc was founded in 2012 as an advocacy organization. Three years later, with the help of Alexander Soros, son of liberal philanthropist George Soros, the group launched the first Jewish political action committee focused on dealing solely with domestic issues, the Forward reported. According to its website, the group supports “everyone threatened by the Trump agenda,” and Alexander Soros is the chair of its board of directors. The Pittsburgh chapter was created shortly after the 2016 election, Friedman said.
&gt; 
&gt; On Sunday, Friedman read the letter, which is also signed by the group’s other 10 leaders, aloud in front of the White House during an afternoon vigil organized by Bend the Arc. To his surprise, he said the crowd began reading the boldfaced sentences with him.
&gt; 
&gt; “People are on board,” Friedman said, describing the experience as “powerful” and “energizing.” “People are hearing the words. People understand why we need do this.”
&gt; 
&gt; In recent days, Trump’s critics have alleged that his incendiary rhetoric has contributed to the current climate of violence — a claim the president and members of the GOP vehemently oppose. Last week, more than 10 pipe bombs were discovered nationwide targeting people including former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama as well as employees at CNN. Cesar Sayoc, who is suspected of mailing the bombs, is a vocal Trump supporter who often ranted about people or organizations the president clashed with, The Post reported.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump has also come under fierce criticism for failing to condemn white supremacists, such as the ones present in Charlottesville last year. After violence broke out at the city’s Unite the Right rally in August 2017, leaving one woman dead and many others injured, the president said he thought there was “blame on both sides,” The Post’s David Nakamura reported.
&gt; 
&gt; Robert Bowers, the man arrested after Saturday’s deadly mass shooting, was active on a social media site known to be frequented by white supremacists, neo-Nazis and others with extreme beliefs that may not be tolerated on more mainstream platforms, The Post reported. A user with Bowers’s name espoused anti-Semitic views — comparing Jews to Satan, for example — and often expressed racism against African Americans, using the n-word in nearly 20 posts.
&gt; 
&gt; “We feel like there have been multiple communities under attack in the United States from the vitriol that the president has been spreading,” Friedman said. “It was the Jewish community’s turn. Blowback from his words came and cost people’s lives, and we said enough is enough.”
&gt; 
&gt; If the president decides to visit Pittsburgh without meeting the letter’s demands, Friedman said, he expects Trump will “only be met with derision.”
&gt; 
&gt; “We will let him know how unhappy we are with his presence, with his lack of leadership,” he said. “He will see all of Pittsburgh in the streets. It’s not just going to be the people that signed on to the letter. It’s going to be everybody.""
&gt; 
&gt; Friedman added, “If he’s going to come to our city, he’s going to come on our terms.”"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfaith_marriage_in_Judaism

&gt;In more recent times, rates of intermarriage have increased generally; for example, the US National Jewish Population Survey 2000-01 reports that, in the United States of America between 1996 and 2001, nearly half (47%) of Jews who had married during that time period had married non-Jewish partners.[55] The 1990 National Jewish Population Survey reported an intermarriage rate of 52 percent among American Jews.[56] The possibility that this might lead to the gradual dying out of Judaism is regarded by most Jewish leaders, regardless of denomination, as precipitating a crisis. For this reason, as early as the mid 19th century, some senior Jewish leaders denounced intermarriage as a danger to the continued existence of Judaism.[57]
&gt;
&gt;In the United States of America, other causes, such as more people marrying later in life, have combined with intermarriage to cause the Jewish community to decrease dramatically; for every 20 adult Jews, there are now only 17 Jewish children. Some religious conservatives now even speak metaphorically of intermarriage as a *silent holocaust*. On the other hand, more tolerant and liberal Jews embrace interfaith marriage as an enriching contribution to a multicultural society. Regardless of attitudes to intermarriage, there is now an increasing effort to reach out to descendants of intermarried parents, each Jewish denomination focusing on those it defines as Jewish;[58] secular and non-denominational Jewish organisations have sprung up to bring the descendants of intermarried parents back into the Jewish fold.[59][60][61][62]

&gt; THE GOOD NEWS is that American Jews--as individuals--have never been more secure, more accepted, more affluent, and less victimized by discrimination or anti-Semitism. The bad news is that American Jews--as a people--have never been in greater danger of disappearing through assimilation, intermarriage, and low birthrates. The even worse news is that our very success as individuals contributes to our vulnerability as a people. The even better news is that we can overcome this new threat to the continuity of American Jewish life and emerge with a more positive Judaism for the twenty-first century--a Judaism that is less dependent on our enemies for its continuity, and that rests more securely on the considerable, but largely untapped, strengths of our own heritage.
&gt;
&gt;American Jewish life is in danger of disappearing, just as most American Jews have achieved everything we ever wanted: acceptance, influence, affluence, equality. As the result of skyrocketing rates of intermarriage and assimilation, as well as ""the lowest birth rate of any religious or ethnic community in the United States,"" the era of enormous Jewish influence on American life may soon be coming to an end. Although Jews make up just over 2 percent of the population of the United States--approximately 5.5 million out of 262 million--many Americans mistakenly believe that we constitute a full 20 percent of the American people, because of our disproportionate visibility, influence, and accomplishments. But our numbers may soon be reduced to the point where our impact on American life will necessarily become marginalized. One Harvard study predicts that if current demographic trends continue, the American Jewish community is likely to number less than 1 million and conceivably as few as 10,000 by the time the United States celebrates its tricentennial in 2076. Other projections suggest that early in the next century, American Jewish life as we know it will be a shadow of its current, vibrant self--consisting primarily of isolated pockets of ultra-Orthodox Hasidim.
&gt;
&gt;Jews have faced dangers in the past, but this time we may be unprepared to confront the newest threat to our survival as a people, because its principal cause is our own success as individuals. Our long history of victimization has prepared us to defend against those who would destroy us out of hatred; indeed, our history has forged a Jewish identity far too dependent on persecution and victimization by our enemies. But today's most serious threats come not from those who would persecute us, but from those who would, without any malice, kill us with kindness--by assimilating us, marrying us, and merging with us out of respect, admiration, and even love. The continuity of the most influential Jewish community in history is at imminent risk, unless we do something dramatic now to confront the quickly changing dangers.

Good luck with *that*, Dershowitz.  Out of the fire and into the melting pot with you!

(The term ""melting pot"" was even [first popularized by a Jewish-American playwright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Melting_Pot_\(play\)) when used by a Jewish-American immigrant character who intermarries.)"
130,e9m57qq,"We're not putting children into camps because they're immigrants, we're putting them into camps because their parents committed the crime of not coming into the country in the right areas if they want to seek asylum. I know you probably want open boarders, but that's not how the world works. While their parents are being processed, we need a place to put the children, so you either put the children in prison with the parents, or you separate them. This was happening under obama, so I guess under your logic it would have been perfectly acceptable to assassinate him.

It's not a matter of taking away the citizenship of people who have already been born in the us, it's a matter of saying 'children of illegal immigrants will no longer automatically become citizens', which is very different, and less convenient to your narrative.

'Casually laying waste' by blacks and latinos willingly choosing to do drugs and kill each other? The 'new jim crow' is just a fancy way of saying 'it's racist to arrest black people for crimes they commit'

I'm not even saying the south didn't deserve to burn! Sherman's march was probably one of the greatest things to come out of the civil war, and the idea that former confederate leaders could go right back to serving in congress was a disgrace! What I'm saying is that you said the civil war was fought over slavery, and you tried to argue that me saying 'I don't want to live through a civil war' means that I'm somehow a racist, southern apologist. Things now aren't as bad as they were back then, but you think a civil war nowadays will be just as justified as the first one.

Ah, thank you for explaining your life story. Now I know for a fact that you've lived a hell of a lot better than most people in the many shit hole nations around the world, where violence and terrorism is a lot more prominent than it is here. I'm sure you feel bad for what America has done to the middle east, with the endless wars all over the place and the horrible unrest. It boggles my mind that you want to turn america into that. Civil wars aren't fun, or easy, it's going to ruin everyone's life in some way, and you're here on the internet, gleefully arguing that we should go for it. That's why I called you a privileged LARPer. Being poor in America is a lot better than living in a lot of other countries, and you haven't lived under the constant threat of violent death.

The cops are more likely to kill an unarmed white person than an unarmed black person, so I'm not sure which 'side' that falls under, and I haven't the faintest idea what you mean by 'White supremacist violence is both on the raise *and done openly now*' Are people not condemned when they shoot up a church or synagogue?

No, I'm not going to 'wonder where all my jewish neighbors go'. This country is owned by the rich, I'm sure you agree, and something like 50% of the jewish community is part of the one percent, and one of our greatest allies is Israel. They'll be fine, you're an intentional fear mongerer.

131,e57cn2j,"Are you really that ignorant or just pretending to try and make a point? 
So let’s go back to Germany post WW1, a country ravaged and broke from the expenses of war. Germany had built up quite a DEFICIT due to numerous expenses from WW1 and a GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS (This is what we call parallel storytelling). Anyway Mr Hitler comes along and, despite being quite a well off chap, starts talking on a level with the working class (hi fellow kids!). He convinces him that he’s just an AVERAGE BLOKE and understands their workaday struggles. One thing leads to another and wahoo his party gets more and more popular due to the rise of something called POPULISM. Mr Hitler wants Germany to GO IT ALONE he doesn’t think we need other countries he wants GERMAN THINGS FOR GERMAN PEOPLE. The problem is this only works up to a point, you need something called a SCAPEGOAT. This is a person or group of people that you can blame for all your problems because for whatever reason (ignorance, hubris, entitlement) you refuse to accept that you are the cause of your own misfortune (ie didn’t pay enough attention in History class or any other classes and didn’t get the right qualifications). It’s easier isn’t it? Blame someone else because then you don’t have to face up to the uncomfortable truth that you are in fact the only reason why you are in your situation. So anyway, slowly slowly Mr Hitler starting sowing the seeds that the Jewish folks are COMING INTO THE COUNTRY IN DROVES, and doing things like MORE CRIME and STEALING JOBS. They were likened to a horde and there were huge posters of QUEUES OF IMMIGRANTS just to hammer it home. It then helped massively that Mr Hitler was friends with NEWSPAPERS and they helped him by PUBLISHING ANTI IMMIGRATION stories etc. This all built up to what we now call WW2 and the holocaust. From tiny acorns do great oak trees grow. People can see the parallels and are taking steps to prevent it leading to something more horrible. Some people have learnt their lessons from history and when we see parallels like this we must be incredibly careful not to just let things play out because people are shit. Then there are some people who are ignorant and refuse to learn from the mistakes made in history, they will turn a blind eye to a genocide somewhere else in the world because they have been brainwashed into thinking those people are the cause of all their problems.

Of course you already knew all of this you just chose to play the ignorance card."

Maybe since wall street stands to make a lot of money from immigration wall street and big banks promote it.  Maybe the reason so many Jewish people promote is because a lot of jewish folks are in wall street and anyone in wall street stands to gain from lots of cheap labor immigrants.

I haven't read enough to really weigh in on the JQ, but from what others say I'm pretty sure its basically just this plus a little bit of helping out a cousin to get those jobs, and a little bit of fear of white pride. Nobody really says that they are plotting things, just that they are inclined to getting positions of power (becuase of IQ and nepotism) and inclined to not care that much for the continuation of whites (partially out of fear and partially out of apathy). 

I also think that we shouldn't see jews as the only reason white nations are in trouble, but there is no denying that they had some effect. "

I know this for a fact, because I sat on the board of directors at my synagogue for the last two years. I saw dozens of official statements and private messages from synagogues and leaders across the country as they drew their own Holocaust comparisons and demanded action.

This guy, some rando internet libertarian, comes along and claims that comparing the camps immigrant children are currently being detained in to concentration camps is disrespectful to the Jews who died in the Holocaust. I tell him that as Jew that's just not true, and we would prefer he not speak for us. He tells me \*I\* can't speak for all Jews. A long argument ensues. I explain to him what I've written above.

139,dwgalkg,"No one in America is ""failing the Jews."" There are numerous apparatus in existence whose primary purpose is acting as a vanguard either against hate crimes and speech or specifically against anti-Semitism. As others have stated, the militantly anti-nazi left is so zealous in warding against the spread of Nazism that they've frequently mistargeted right wingers who had no anti-Semitic tendencies. The best example I can think of there is President Donald Trump.

Some of the things I see get termed anti-Semitic make me scratch my head. For example, take ""Hollywood is run by Jews""...it is! It was literally founded by a bunch of Jewish immigrants! A positively incredible proportion of big players in the industry happen to be Jewish, to this very day. Now, I understand how that can slide into ""Jews control our minds through their Jew media,"" which is classic anti-Semitism. But if we can't even admit basic facts about the prominence of Jews in American life due to accusations that pointing out such facts is anti-Semitic, I would say we have an epidemic of Jewish oversensitivity to persecution on our hands. 

It's Hegelian dialectics. Jewish people are disproportionately represented in finance, cinema, media, lists of billionaires, higher education, even Congress to a small degree. They are the highest earning minority by no small margin. Yet many Jewish folks are hypersensitive to any of that being highlighted because they think it'll slip into theories of covert Jewish takeover. But by reacting defensively to such facts being pointed out, it is basically ensured that some will begin to *believe* in theories of Jewish control, and therefore become full-blown anti-semites.

Jews, as a social group, maintain a privileged position in American society. We can't use wage disparities to highlight male privilege, incarceration rates or average net worth to show white privilege, and not use the exact same or similar measures to arrive at the conclusion of Jewish privilege by the framework established by the left. 

That is how I see the macro view of this issue. As for rising incidents of anti-Semitic violence, it's troubling, but I think honesty about the above nature of the reality of the Jewish people en masse will help quell the true anti-semites. These people propagating these hate crimes are still a small, disturbed minority who mainstream folks on the left and right alike do not stand with."

Then you have no right to be in an apartheid state that includes religion in its immigration criteria. Come to civilised Europe before the far-right ultra-orthodox nutjobs stone you to death.

So Israeli officials come up with a ridiculous lie after a bit of ethnic cleansing and you take it as scripture?

&gt; Those Jews from 1882 were not religious.

Wanna bet?

&gt; I didn't know that we are now allowed to dictate immigration policies for other countries?

Buddy, you live in a country built on terrorism that treats non-Jews as second rate citizens or dirty African ""infiltrators"" while cheerfully bombing Syria and trying to start a new and exciting war with Iran. Open your eyes. You're the baddies.

&gt; Israel was the only country on the planet that welcomed my family in 1992, shortly after the USSR broke up.

Only because they thought you're part of God's chosen tribe (he hates all others), but now that you renounced the religion that gave you your privileged identity you risk being stoned to death.

&gt; Where is your compassion for these refugees.

In those concentration camps that king Bibi is building for African immigrants that have no divine right to the Palestinian's land.

&gt; Most Jews living in Israel are not religious and neither am I.

""According to a December 2017 study conducted Israeli Democracy Institute, the number of Haredi Jews in Israel exceeded 1 million in 2017, making up 12% of the population in Israel. By 2030, the Haredi Jewish community is projected to make up 16% of the total population, and by 2065 one third of the Israeli population.""

Israel is not going to magically become a paradise just because you pretend not to see those things that made USSR's atrocities pale in comparison.

&gt; Maybe we can agree that both populations were treated poorly?

It's hard to have sympathy for the invaders who blew up building filled with civilians or put Holocaust survivors in a ship so they can attack baffled British soldiers on their arrival in the holy land. I'll sympathize with the guy who said that the bride is beautiful but is already taken, not with the rapists.

145,ds80nxt,"Starting a school (that is, a school with a dedicated building and a faculty and a sizeable student body) requires a tremendous amount of money, money that will have to come from (drum roll please) charitable giving by Orthodox lay people.


Now you see where the problem is! 


I'm being sarcastic, but I believe my point is valid. There is simply not enough charitable giving, or tithing, by your average Orthodox lay person. 

I grew up in an area of the country that had a sizeable Jewish minority. I saw them give a lot of money to their charitable endeavors such as schools, nursing homes, hospitals, etc. For them, doing such things fulfill the commandments and are a ""mitzvah"" or ""good deed"". 

The Jewish community is a great example of a small minority in America (I think about 5 or 6 million out of over 400 million) yet, their impact on our society and culture far exceeds their numbers. 

One may say, ""well, lets get all the jurisdictions to pool their resources together and form a pan Orthodox school"". 

Well, that's going to a mountain of a challenge as well, as most of the more ethnic jurisdictions will bicker over what this school will get to be, ethnically speaking.

This is why we don't have Orthodox hospitals, and other charitable institutions to the degree that other churches and denominations have.

One might say, we're too small. Well, there are denominations that are comparable in size to us yet they have schools and hospitals.

Unfortunately, as much as some here might wish to believe otherwise, Orthodoxy in the US and most Western countries is still very much a immigrant/ethnic oriented Church. Until that changes, these things will continue to challenge attempts at establishing such schools like you're talking about. Because of that, to answer your question, no, there are no well established schools like what you are describing. "

&gt; One of the leaders of the deadly ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend was Mike Peinovich, aka ""Mike Enoch,"" a popular neo-Nazi blogger and podcaster who was outed back in January as an Upper East Side software developer with a Jewish wife.

The group's members were Russian immigrants aged 16 to 21. According to The Daily Telegraph, the men's families were allowed to settle in Israel under the Law of Return, meaning that they all had at least one grandparent with a Jewish mother, although none of them were Jewish according the Jewish law.

""Immigrants protesting to allow more immigrants to come in. Lovely... 

The Jewish community is free to continue to strike, is Arabs will make up for the slack. The current immigration laws will maintain the population distribution at a stable 20% Jewish. There is no moral or logical reason to allow more immigrants to enter the country against the will of the native population. Palestine belongs to the Arabs the same way England belongs to the English or France belongs to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs. In fact this year's investigation has concluded that the riots 1 year prior were caused by Jewish immigration and land purchases. More immigration will not solve this issue. 

Additionally, the Jews are free to leave should they not like it here. This is not their country. They are in no obligation to stay here. Argentina has opened its borders to them and they will be more appreciated there than here and be able to purchase more fertile land. Palestinian Arabs have lived here for thousands of years and shall continue to act as law abiding citizens and close allies to the British unlike the Jews who only cause trouble by claiming land that is not theirs and creating unrest. We urge our people however, not to instigate violence as that would accomplish nothing. 

The memorandum signed shall bring lasting peace to Palestine and prevent further ethnic conflict. It is in line with previous agreements with the British such as the McMahon Hussein Agreement promising the establishment of an Arab state in Palestine. We are sure that the British would agree that it is smarter to align oneself with the majority of the population who are actually from this land rather than immigrants trying to create trouble. """

150,dj4mg13,"The Jewish community is tight night because they've pretty much have always had to have been to avoid on-going persecution. 

My issue when people try to claim ""well Hispanic and black people should just act Asian (whatever my stereotypical world view thinks it is)"" is that it is so naive. It's comparing apples to oranges.  

1. [Education](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/06/19/the-rise-of-asian-americans/): 61% of Asian immigrants who come to this country already have a bachelor's degree, which is *significantly higher* ([""hyper-selectivity""](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2015/11/10/how-upwardly-mobile-are-hispanic-children-depends-how-you-look-at-it/)) than the countries they come from. Ex: only about 27% of adults ages 25 to 64 in South Korea and 25% in Japan have a bachelor’s degree or more. Your children are more likely to be better educated when you have a better education. This is just a fact. Places like Mexico have [hypo-selectivity](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2015/11/10/how-upwardly-mobile-are-hispanic-children-depends-how-you-look-at-it/), which is the opposite. These are people who know their economic mobility is limited in their native countries.

2. [College vs Work](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/28/5-facts-about-latinos-and-education/). ""In a 2014 National Journal poll, 66% of Hispanics who got a job or entered the military directly after high school cited the need to help support their family as a reason for not enrolling in college, compared with 39% of whites."" Again going back to generally being less educated it means you have less resources to go to school. 

3. [Things are improving.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/28/5-facts-about-latinos-and-education/) Many have left the agricultural work their parents performed, with 22 percent of second-generation men from Mexico and 31 percent of those from Central America in professional or managerial positions in 2003-2013.) ""Many have left the agricultural work their parents performed, with 22 percent of second-generation men from Mexico and 31 percent of those from Central America in professional or managerial positions in 2003-2013."" Educational attainment and dropout rates are also improving.

My best friend (since we were kids) comes from an upper middle class family and I was from a low income family (despite having a college educated father). I love her to death but she imagines everyone has the same opportunities she does. When I told her my parents don't really have money for retirement she said ""oh it's because no one taught them."" WRONG! It's because my parents, despite working multiple jobs each when I was growing up, lived pay check to pay check. When I see sweeping generalizations it reminds me of the article: [Everyone Thinks They Are the Middle Class](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-america-divided/middle-class/) because if you think your life is standard it's hard to imagine others'.

TLDR; you can't compare higher educated (percentage higher than their native countries) immigrants to less educated immigrants and expect the same outcome. Your parents money and educational level matter!"
151,fwwgen4,"Germany has done very well, so much so that the German Jewish community is one of the few growing in the world, and not because the German Jews are having so many children, but thanks to immigration of Jews from other countries, even including Israel. 

I've just read the memoirs of Deborah Feldman (which the Netflix movie Unorthodox is based on) and she is part of this growing community. A friend of mine from Düsseldorf even tells me that they are treated with special care (e.g. if they are in a queue at the post office, they are invited to cut the queue), though I can't tell. When I lived in Munich and Hamburg, I didn't even notice any.

I am actually quite envious of their approach and wish that Italy had adopted something like it. We actually started off more or less at the same point (maybe a bit better, because Italian resistance was sizeable and many cities revolted, and also killed Mussolini), the Allies pressured our post war govt to de fascist-ize the country, but quickly abandoned it when the communists, both domestically and in EE, became a menace. But in the past decades we simply stopped talking about WWII and the twenty years before or even had politicians push the narrative that fascists and resistance fighters were both fighting for their ideals and thus equally worthy of respect."
152,fxc3p1c,"The limitations surely existed for Jews, discrimination no doubt existed; it has for every ethnic/religious minority, from the Irish and Chinese immigration waves in the 1800s, to the early 1900 Jewish migrations, to the Jews who FDR turned away during the war. People killed us, we faced discrimination, but to even try to compare it what the Black community has experienced is astounding, and that's what I'm talking about. Systematic efforts to oppress every race occurred, but none were more effective, targeted, and widespread than Jim Crowe, slavery, the war on drugs, etc.  My family came to this country after the holocaust during a time of open lynchings. The Jews have never seen Rosewood or Tulsa in the US. The worst antisemitic attack on our community occurred in MY community 2 years ago. I know antisemitism better than you can imagine, so don't quote history to try and tell me Jews are persecuted more because we have a higher percentage of hate crimes when our prisons are overflowing with Black men and children.

If you are born a Jew today, you still have far more opportunities. Don't believe me? The Jewish community is more affluent, organized, and represented in government and business. We have longer life expectancy and average income. We don't live in fear of a cop killing us because being Jewish is subconsciously linked with being dangerous. You can not compare the two."
153,fxd5gnh,"I respect your opinion and I appreciate you trying to make sense of this whole thing, but to say that ""relatively nothing has happened to the Jewish community"" is disingenuous. There have been multiple synagogue shootings in the past few years and in late 2019 there was a string of hate crimes on Jews in NYC. Jewish people comprise 13% of NYC and are victims of 55% of the hate crimes. I believe the numbers are even crazier on a national scale (I need to fact check it, but I read somewhere that Jews make up 2% of the population in the US and are victims of a vast majority of the hate crimes - if that's wrong, I apologize and if I find any stats that say otherwise, I will edit that).

Aside from the issues of anti-semitism in this country and across the world, I think most of the outrage from this issue is coming from the hypocrisy of the people who destroyed Drew Brees and asked him to retire (Shannon Sharpe) when he said he supported the BLM movement, but didn't agree with their means of protesting and he, personally, would not disrespect the flag. Bad place, bad time for Brees to be defending his love for the flag, but the statement itself did not warrant that type of reaction. Fast forward to DeSean Jackson's comments and not only did it take a couple of days for it to really get attention, but the same people that have been fighting for justice are now somehow supporting DJax and some people (ahem...SJax) are quadrupling down on their hateful statements. Then you have Shannon Sharpe saying people are overreacting and that Louis Farrakhan didn't show signs of anti-semitism when he met him and making him out to be a good guy. This is the same guy that is against the LGTBQ community, against women, and said that Jews are termites that need to exterminated.

I am Jewish and I'll be honest, if this happened last year, I probably wouldn't have really batted an eye. I would've been a bit upset, but I would've said to myself ""wow, what a dumbass"" and moved on with my life because the sad reality of life is that there will always be hateful, bigoted, racist people in the world. We can change the system to give as equal of an opportunity as possible to people of all backgrounds, but it's impossible to change each individual and make everyone free of hate, racism, and bigotry. And at the end of the day, some words that DJax said (whether filled with racism or just ignorance) don't affect my day to day life and my ability to succeed in this country. I do take issue, however, in today's day and age when I have seen the masses attempt to cancel anyone who doesn't fully subscribe to their beliefs or anyone who has a dissenting opinion and then there is deafening silence when there is some other form of hate being spread. 

LeBron is someone who has lost all of my respect this past year with his response to Morey about his Hong Kong comments and now with his silence on this matter. He was the one posting quotes about Injustice anywhere meaning there is injustice everyone. He was the one saying we stop living once we start being silent on all matters. He was the one saying ""if you ain't with us, then we ain't with ya'll."" Well LeBron, I watched a lot of these protests and saw people of all backgrounds supporting your cause. I personally know a lot of Jews that marched so apparently they are with you. But your silence makes it clear that regardless of what their stance is, you are not with them. 

At the end of the day, we are all humans and we are all Americans here. We have 330 million people living in the craziest melting pot experiment in human history. We are going to have disagreements on crime, immigration, health care etc. A vast majority of people don't believe in what they believe in because they think it will do harm. They believe those things because they think it's the best solution to a specific problem. But we are getting to a point where everything is so divisive and when all of these athletes and this entire movement could have taken a great step towards uniting us all and condemning these comments, we have radio silence or, even worse, support for these hateful comments. Let's just get back to the times where we could have civil discourse and understand that a political disagreement does not mean that someone is full of hate or bigotry. Let's try to hear people out and see where they are coming from rather than building our entire opinion on someone based on their stance on one specific issue."

&gt;A reactionary response to Trans-generational trauma  
&gt;  
&gt;After Hindus, Jewish community is the second most affected community that has witnessed barbarism and butchery on an enormous scale in the name of religious and racial hatred which therefore bound to inculcate Trans-generational trauma among people of jewish community. In cases of Trans-generational Trauma, the traumatic event does not need to be individually experienced; the lasting effects can still remain and impact descendants from external factors like it can be a shared response to societal trauma. Now culminating effect of past experience of persecution and holocoust and the recent immigration of Jews from Europe in the wake of hate crimes will definitely resonate into an explosion of emotions and grief, beyond any shadow of doubt. This unresolved grief often times accompanies a reactionary response which can be passed from one generation to the next. And the most possible way in which we can see the reflection of its outcome in a democratic society is through unfoldings of political and social discourses in a given society, where people hardly missed a chance to assert their identity both socially and politically. So it will not be wrong to say that consciously or subconsciously psyche of Jewish community is not immuned from this traumatic effect. And reflection of this is evidently visible in the State policies of Israel ever since her establishment and the move of bringing new Nation State Law is nothing but a further add-up to the routine of this reflection

155,fp7d8a5,"&gt; Question: are there any Israeli TV shows on Arab Jewish communities before the state of Israel?

Yes.  Let's be clear there are about 20x as many regarding the Ashkenazi communities but certainly there are shows about Arab Jewish communities.  Sh’chur is a movie that became a TV show.  It started with a Jew returning their Moroccan  village after having ""gone western"".  Its by a Mizrahi Jew but a rather harsh assessment of Arab / Mizrahi culture.

I Bajou is considered one of the great Jewish movies of the 20th century (so not a show).  It deals with the immigration from Tunis. 

Another movie that was crazy popular in Israel about Yeminite Jewish community is Zohar.  

&gt; Many people don't know this but Iraqi Jewish Intellectuals in the 20's and 30's contributed to the body of Arab nationalism.

We know it. Back then Jews thought they could be Iraqi. 

&gt; I spoke to relatives who have been watching Um Fahoum and their beef had nothing to do with the characters Jewishneas, but because it portrays her as wanting to leave for Israel.

They all mostly left.  Which is to say their objection is to dealing with reality.  Something to think about."
156,fpl9vof,"&gt; Despite a similar anti-globalist, anti- neoliberal, anti-elite stance, the RN is bleeding the traditional left dry simply because it acknowledges that mass immigration is the product of neoliberalism, and the current wave of delinquency the product of mass immigration, both which have decimated working-class communities.

This is how fascists have traditionally competed with the Left.

&gt; The point was how you can you prove that far right anti semitic attacks outnumber those down by Islamists/ muslims when the study uses the same category for both.

German statistics separate out hate crimes by motivation. They consider religious motivation as a category, contrary to what you're saying. For the year 2018, these are the number of anti-Semitic attacks motivated by each category, according to official statistics:

* left-wing: 3
* right-wing: 49
* foreign ideologies: 10
* religious ideologies: 4
* uncategorized: 3

The statistics for anti-Semitic hate crimes more generally follow similar proportions (though the overall numbers are much larger).

&gt; I said attacks on jews are mostly the work of muslims, which is a reality for actual jews living in Europe.

I've just cited statistics from Germany showing that that is very far from being the case. We're talking about an order of magnitude more physical attacks coming from the far right than from religious extremists.

The right wing also goes after Muslims in Germany. There were 65 anti-Muslim attacks motivated by far-right ideology registered in 2018. There are more Muslims in Germany, so one could argue that the Jewish community is more affected, but far-right violence is the overwhelming factor in both cases."
157,fkyoy1h,"Great, we're making progress. So the fundamental disagreement is that you don't believe any group of people has any right to a homeland of their own? Of course this isn't a concern for any other people other than Europeans, as it's its only European homelands that are under demographic threat. 

&gt;Immigration has helped us further our science and our economy more than isolated countries. These two are important to me particularly the science and technological side.

I don't doubt that the GDP has increased, but this effect pools at the top of society. At the bottom it drives down wages in low skilled jobs, and at the same time it drives up house prices, rents and puts pressure on services. It racially and culturally divides the workforce and makes it difficult for labour to unionise. It's anti labour. 

To be perfectly honest with you though, and if you can answer this I'd appreciate it, how much economic growth does it take to justify the fact that the English community I grew up in is now a Pakistani community? At what percentage increase in GDP am I supposed to be happy that immigration displaced the historic culture of my town and replaced it with something foreign? What percentage GDP growth justifies my people being reduced to a minority in their homeland? What percentage of GDP growth justifies the Pakistani rape gangs that have operated, and continued to operate in my home town? If you explained the GDP benefits to those girls, I wonder, would they say ""oh well then, it was all worth it!""?

The problem that you have is this kind of theoretical idealism doesn't work in the real world. What you're calling racism is the norm for almost every single group of people on the planet. They have an in group preference. They take their own side. This is true even of the diverse communities that are present inside of Western nations. If you have ever lived around Muslims (in my personal experience Pakistanis), for example, they are an extremely ethnically nepotistic community. They are highly insular and aggressively, violently, take their own side. They are highly organised politically in the interest of their own group.

The Jewish community is also highly insular and looks after its own people probably more than any other group in the country. Jewish communities have their own private police force and ambulance service. They are highly organised politically in the interest of their own group. 

Now, you disagree with my solutions to the problem, which is just to take the side of my own group in their homeland. But you have to look at the current system as it ACTUALLY functions.

Tell me, how do you prevent all these diverse groups from perusing their own group interests? How do you intend to stop Africans in Britain advocating for African interests? How do you intend to stop Muslims advocating for Muslim interests? How do you intend to stop Jews advocating for Jewish interests? And, being the only group that can't advocate for their own interests, wouldn't (what we'll just agree to call) the white British population be at a disadvantage in such a society?

Also, there are already race based laws in Britain. Anything mentioning racial equality or any efforts to increase diversity are inherently discriminatory against white people. Why is my theoretical racial discrimination any worse than the actual racial discrimination we have against whites in the nation today?

So, I'm an advocate for my own people. I like your point of view in theory, and I'd get on board with it as soon as every other group stops playing the game for themselves. 

How would you address these problems?

When I see you going as hard against Jews and Muslims, groups that ACTUALLY do organise in their own group interest in the nation today, then I'll take you seriously about ""just treating people as people"", because until then you're just someone who gets riled up only at the thought of white people advocating for themselves."

160,f8yyllf,"I don't think it's necessarily dismissive to question ***some*** peoples' political motivations for saying things. I have been a regular on this sub for a fairly long time and you get to recognise usernames and extrapolate philosophical positions. To be blunt. when there are users who are generally anti-immigration, anti-multiculturalism, anti-political correctness suddenly falling over themselves to cater for the sensibilities of a single minority grouping it stretches credulity to suggest that this represents anything other than a cynical exploitation of that minority for their own ends.

If we look at the [JPR report on antisemitism](https://www.jpr.org.uk/documents/JPR.2017.Antisemitism_in_contemporary_Great_Britain.pdf) we can see that the actual risk to the Jewish community is relatively low and the targeted attacks that make the special security necessary come not from the left but the far right.

I think what that report is very good at pointing out is that various antisemitic tropes exist independently of an individual and pronounced animus against Jewish people. And this is largely what we're talking about with the Labour handling of this issue.

With the caveat that in a sufficiently large cohort you are going to find stone racists and that Labour membership is currently at around 485,000 so if we do a crude calculation and say that the 2.4% of the population that the JPR says are actual antisemites means that there are at least 12 individuals who have

&gt; strong, sophisticated, perhaps internally coherent and at times even ‘learned’ antisemitism, where open dislike of Jews is combined with developed negative ideas about Jews

I would say that the people that have given offence on this issue are those that have made it a point to extensively discuss and become involved with politics in the Eastern Mediterranean, often in a somewhat simplistic way.

The idea that there is a single British Jewish community lined up behind Likud is clearly a nonsense. That there is no support for Likud at all is also fantastical. There are many Jewish people in Britain who are opposed to the political direction of travel of successive Israeli governments but for non-Jews here is where the problems start.

The shorthand way of separating opposition to particular policies of Israeli governments rather than a dislike of Jewish people on the British left used to be to say that you were not antisemitic but anti-Zionist and indeed a used to use this formulation myself. Then I saw a video by Howard Jacobson in which he pointed out that the term implied an opposition to the existence of the state itself. This seemed a very fair point.

To me, to take issue with the racism and democratic deficit of the philosophy of those on the hard right of Israeli politics while ignoring the disgusting worldview of Hamas is childish and wrongheaded. If there is a genuine criticism to be made of Corbyn, and many of his supporters, I think that this is it. I don't think it invalidates his criticism of Israeli government policies but I do think that the taking sides element does weaken the moral standing of the critic somewhat. When I see people waving Palestinian banners at Labour Party events I think they are being naive. I would also be just as loathe to witness Israeli flags. We should be condemning intransigence on both sides.

With reference to the Jewish Banking Conspiracy trope I always say that there is a banking conspiracy but it isn't Jewish. If you want to see it in action look at the commodification of housing and the sub-prime mortgage scandal. The bankers^^1 fucked us out of trillions of whatever currency you want to count it in. Goldman Sachs were a major player in that. I don't pick them because they have a Jewish sounding name, I pick them because they were up to their necks in it. Bear Stearns, Morgan Stanley the same. I think it then becomes a problem to talk about putting the blame on dishonest and bad-faith vendors of financial instruments when the banking industry's PR flaks are constantly trying to conflate this with antisemitism. There are individuals within finance that have done things that are wrong and their ethnicity should neither give them a free pass nor single them out for scapegoat status, whatever that ethnicity^^2 happens to be.

So people on the left that have problems with Israeli domestic and foreign policy and also with organised capital and talk about this in shorthand or simplistic terms are prone to giving offence on this issue and because of how humans are will sometimes double down when they oughtn't.

^^1 I'm using bankers and banking here to talk about the financial services industry and banks as a whole here. I don't mean to imply bank tellers or middle management are responsible for the mess.

162,ezfqptd,"&gt; This is the country that more than any other stood up to the Nazis, so the idea that it isn’t a safe haven for Jewish people contradicts everything from the war effort. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In June 1940, with a German invasion expected at any moment, Prime Minister Winston Churchill decided to arrest every German and Austrian in the country and send them all to concentration camps. To those who reminded him that many of these people were Jewish refugees, he responded briefly and memorably: “Collar the lot!”

This might seem like an offhand comment, but it's really important. These people treat antisemitism like it was a fever dream of Hitler and that in 1945 it was eradicated forever, and the **national mythmaking around WW2** is all built to support this idea of Britain as *liberator of the jews*\*, and as long as you are coming from that assumption, ignoring the history of antisemitism in the UK, then you are fundamentally unequipped to actually deal with antisemitism as it exists now.

&gt; “The Jewish community is the canary in the cage for the health of everybody else and society; that has been the case throughout history,” 

It's also worth noting of course, that John Mann himself is a racist, who justified supporting Leave on immigration, and supports austerity, so one has to wonder who's health he actually cares about. He also supported the Iraq war and said of an MP criticizing Israel that they're ""playing the race card in order to chase Muslim votes"". One would argue that Islamophobia is the main modern *acceptable form of racism*, and so is a better ""canary in the cage"", but what do I know? Oh and while we're at acceptable forms of racism, [he once published an anti-Gypsy brochure](https://skwawkbox.org/2017/08/27/moderate-labour-mp-interviewed-by-police-over-hate-incident-pamphlet/).

163,ew6i5mr,"&gt; *That said, I don't think there's any  conspiracy to bring Jews into the white nationalist fold anytime soon.  One characteristic of the global Jewish community is the staggering  diversity of thought among various demographics--and the ability for  these demographics to coexist and tolerate one another regardless. It's  the reason you have the super gay Tel Aviv a short bus ride away from  the hyper conservative Jerusalem.*

That's fair, so I'll clarify.  I am not suggesting that all Jews are like that because there many Jews throughout history who have influenced the modern political left.   I am speaking of certain influential Jewish conservative pundits such as Ben Shapiro who has been shown to influence a lot of these nutcase who are doing mass shootings of innocent people with who leave manifestos that echo the philosophies of Ben Shapiro and his ilks.  I also don't think that many Jews are secretly wanting to become neo-Nazi, but rather I think the end game of some of these guys is to erase the line separating  Jews from Europeans, which will benefit Israel greatly.  

 

&gt;*Specifically  to America, right wingers are more diverse in thought than leftists  assume them to be. The left, however, has been pounding the right with  such frequent insults  (nazi, racist, etc) that it has bound them into  sort of coalition, from countryside evangelicals to urban atheist  libertarians to, yes, even a certain group of Jewish right wingers.  Together they fight against what they believe to the left-dominated  cultural and political establish.*

I agree and well aware of the liberal and conservative spectrum.  It's hard for me to take the lemmings of both sides seriously  because there tends to be a large disconnect between, again, the lemmings and the intellectuals.  However, when it comes to influential people on both left and right philosophical debate, I find that the right's argument is full of half truths, especially when they try to use history as the bases of their argument by using selective key words or terms without understanding or unwilling to accept context, for example, the root cause of the mass immigration from Central and South American, the idea that the belief in God is an end all be all solution to social ills or the need for perpetual war.  Take away the blaming of victims of wars, victims of America's bad foreign policies, and the right-wing facing  up to the fact that a lot of American's foreign policies is suicidal and genocidal and end the wars, then I will be on the same page as the right-wingers as how to build a better society because the left is doing a terrible job in that department."

While Argentinean government officials were pretty active on providing undercover shelter to former Nazis they wouldn't be willing to engage Israel or Soviet Union to protect the Nazis (Jewish community is pretty strong in Argentina too and very rich and influential).

The Soviets (and Israelis in that case) could use Uruguay as an entry point to reach inside Brazilian territory, as Uruguay was the only country in South America to have a unbroken diplomatic relationship with Soviet Union since the 1930s. Most of the other South American countries didn't have diplomatic relations with Soviet Union, or when they kept those relations (Brazilian and Argentinian cases) while under military rule sponsored by us (US and CIA), Soviet diplomatic representations were heavily monitored by security forces (and our CIA, which worked through local security forces as part of our dirty war in Latin America against USSR). 

However, I guess the best infiltration point into Brazil would be through the border with Paraguay, which is still, practically, a no-mans-land up to this day, used by drug smugglers and terrorists to carry all sorts of contraband, with the happy support of Paraguayan and Brazilian respective border (immigration and customs) enforcement officers (for a small bribe, of course). So, Mossad operatives could land in Uruguay under the cover of a ""Soviet delegation"" and then cross the border into Argentina and finally into Paraguay, get all and any weaponry they would need delivered there, and then cross into Brazil to reach Hitler's hideout.

165,eocwccf,"Yes, way to focus on a relatively minor Muslim SS unit while completely ignoring the fact that Jews have formed the intellectual and financial backbone of the open borders, pro-multiculturalism, and anti-White radical left for the last several decades - which is largely to blame for mass Muslim immigration into the West today. And pay no attention to the fact that the Jewish community is united in their militant opposition to Trump's Muslim travel ban and restrictions on immigration in general. Jews led the effort to make America, the West, and the world Nazi-proof by eroding White ethnocentrism, nationalism, bigotry, and social conservatism - which in turn has greased the tracks for the open borders, multiculturalism, and diversity worship that now dominates Western culture today. And one of the unintended consequences of that great cucking of the West has been the mass importation of Muslims that hate Jews because Zionist Jews are trying to forcibly steal the Arab Muslim land known as Palestine and are manipulating the U.S. government into sewing chaos throughout the Middle East in order to weaken Israel's enemies in the region - which included the [2003 invasion of Iraq](http://archive.fo/hvC9y), which in turn spawned the Islamic State."
166,ekcxema,"This isn't an effort to win over Jewish voters, it is an effort to up donations from a very small set of already conservative Jewish donors.

The American Jewish community is very diverse, similarly to how almost every religious community in America tends to be diverse in denominations due to how immigration occurs in the US.

But the vast majority of American Jews are Democrats, while the majority of Israeli Jews support Trump and disapproved of Obama (meaning they would almost certainly identify as Republicans if they were or are US citizens.) The split between Israeli and American Jews has been widening more and more in recent decades.

167,eh8sph0,"in steps Mr Miliband to demand that the government recognise the state of Palestine alongside the state of Israel.”
It’s a powerful – and accurate – critique of Labour’s Mid East policy. And it’s a critique that should have Ed Miliband and his advisers very, very worried, because the Labour party’s support within the Jewish community is now on the brink of collapse.
“It’s serious” one influential Jewish Labour supporter told me this morning. “There are now genuine questions being asked about whether we will be able to vote Labour next May”.
There are multiple reasons for this schism. One is the belief that Labour’s Middle East policy is now being set by the party’s left, which has historically aligned itself with the Palestinian cause. This view was confirmed when Miliband initially announced he would be whipping his MPs to support Palestinian statehood, although in the face of a rebellion from a number of shadow ministers and backbenchers he eventually backed off.

168,eiffn71,"An interesting report on a recent survey of Canadian Jews, especially as concerns demographics, religious identity and practice, synagogue membership, attachment to Israel, etc.

This article comments on some of the important ways in which the Jewish community in Canada compares to our counterpart in the USA -- less intermarriage, greater traditional observance, greater synagogue affiliation, more people associated with Conservative and Orthodox congregations vs. Reform, more Sephardim on a percentage basis, etc.

Many of the trends reflect the fact that the Canadian Jewish community is relatively younger, the start of large-scale Jewish immigration from Europe having occurred a couple of generations later than in the USA. There seems to be a greater connection to the ""old country"" here."
169,ecag1p1,"&gt;  It's anti-Zionists who don't agree, not BDS. Let's not conflate concepts, please

Fair enough. 

&gt;  Anti-Zionism rejects the justness of a Jewish state in Israel. That wouldn't necessarily mean Israeli Jews would have to leave. 

I agree.   Some (most) are not expulsionists or exterminationists.  

&gt; Many anti-Zionists support a non-denominational or bi-national state, where all citizens are equal.

True in theory but note only after the demographics have been deliberately shifted in such a way that a democracy leaves Jews helpless and miserable.  This starts to get into the whole magic wand problem.   we haven't lost a state as powerful as Israel since WWI and we are still having wars off some of those state's collapses.  Most anti-Zionists don't want what Israel dying would actually look like.  But at what point if X is perusing a policy whose almost certain result is Y while claiming to want Z to we hold the person responsible for Y and not Z?  

Most Jews rightfully would rather die than live under the state that anti-Zionist envision for them.  I think in 1947-9 and 1973 they proved that.  BDSers mostly pursue political actions designed to terrify Jews and radicalize the diaspora community further.  Hamas certainly has successfully radicalized the Israeli population.  

I address this a bunch in places like: https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/a12967/what_israel_sells_tracking_another_bdser_lie/ .  It comes down to what extent do you believe the willful ignorance is ignorance and not simple dishonesty about the goals.  I simply don't believe BDSers (and here I am using the term to be a subset of anti-zionists) actually hold the positions they claim to hold.  If they did they would be more interested in the factual discrepancies.  

&gt; Ben Gurion already said that ""the old will die and the young will forget"", 70 years ago. They clearly have not forgotten ...If Jews have clung on to the land where their national identity originated thousands of years ago, even after so long time passed that none of them could any longer trace their ancestry back to the last dwellers of Judea, how can you expect Palestinians to give up in just a couple of generations?

It hasn't been long enough yet.  We still have living 1st generation refugees.  That being said... most people do give up their claims with 3-5 generations.   My grandmother was passionately angry about land we lost in the race riots of the 1960s.  My daughter considers it a family myth.  I don't long for various places we lived in Ukraine.  Now part of the difference is as you mention Palestinians have been kept in a situation where they haven't been able to adjust.  And I think the original refugees are part of the problem.  I also think things like travel restrictions by Israel are to blame.  I'd like those refugees to be able to visit and see the country they talk about simply doesn't exist anymore.  

&gt; about half of them live under foreign occupation in their own homeland. That is simply something nobody can move on from.

Agreed.  That problem has to get solved.  

&gt;  You can't expect them to be treated similarly.

Yes I can expect them to be treated similarly.  The failure of every other case to be treated similarly is part of the reason why Jews (myself included) while fully understanding that the creation of Israel did massive harm to the Palestinians and derailed their natural development still see anti-Zionism as fundamentally an antisemetic and not a pro-Palestinian movement.  Uniquely singling Jews out for punishment is something that they can only resist.  

&gt; Criticism against Israel is generally based on actual violations of human rights and International Law that need to be addressed.

I don't find that to be true of Western critics.   For example BDSers used to ferociously angry about the flooding that Israel was causing in Gaza.  When this got investigated and every investigation showed it was Hamas not Israel they became absolutely indifferent.  If this was about the human rights violation you would have expected a change in attitude once it turned out Israel was not guilty and that criticism being directed at Hamas.  But nothing like that happened.

What I see (again Palestinians excluded this is about Westerners) is far more consistent with people who could generally care less about actual Israeli violation and just hate the idea of Jews being a free and equal people.  Specific violations are just excuses. 

Now when it comes to Palestinians I see something similar.  Obviously the specific violations do bother them.  But when genuine utilitarian options are offered to make things better they refuse.  They seem far more interested in not legitimizing Zionism than avoiding any actual harms.  A good example was when Israel offered to rescue the Palestinians in the Syrian refugee camp being exterminated by ISIS and move them to the West Bank on the grounds they agreed to this as a final resolution of their refugee status.  PA turned Israel down flat, preferring ISIS exterminate them.  Similarly various concessions from Hamas that could improve the welfare of Gazans tremendously.  

&gt; In any case, there is a clear correlation between implementation of the Zionist agenda and Arab violence.

I don't think we have enough data points to say that.  1920-1 Zionizes the Jewish population.   By 1936 the Palestinian Jewish community is Zionist so anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist violence is the same thing.   The correlation exists in time.  There is simply no way to tell how much was due to immigration and how much was due to Zionism.  What the 1920-1 events show that when the violence started it was anti-Jewish not anti-Zionist.  1929 is sort of an intermediate stage.

&gt; Nobody gave a hoot about them in ancient times

Here you are factually wrong.  I think I'm going to write some posts on this.

170,eatykxs,"'*I'm scared for the future of my baby here': Fear in France's Jewish community*' is the title. 

The focus is CNN's. But given this context, it's notable that Jewish organisations have been prominently pushing for '*diversity*', undermining any '*European character*' for Europe (whereas for Israel, lo and behold, their values suddenly switch around!), pushing for more and more immigration of non-Europeans into Europe, which then leads to more Muslims and therefore to ... '*Fear in France's Jewish community*'.

In any case, who gives a fuck about France's *Jewish* community specifically? The Jewish French are just some of the French people affected. France in its entirety has been affected ... the **French**  community. And it's not just France. Due to the pro-diversity push for uncontrolled immigration of non-Europeans (and their mentalities) into Europe, the whole of Europe has become more dangerous. **That**'s the issue CNN should be focusing on but won't. About the real issue ... crickets at CNN. Why, by the way?

And, incidentally, how many comparatively more *specifically Jewish* French people have there been that have  been harmed compared to the non-Jewish-Frenchmen and women that have *indeed* been murdered in France (Bastille day,  Bataclan, etc. etc. etc.)? 

Finally, the article tells us that, as if deserting a ship (after they helped sink it?) ... '*according to the Jewish Agency for Israel, 55,000 French Jews have left the country since the year 2000*' ... ostensibly for Israel.

Well, isn't that special? :/

171,e8w7kp8,"Immigration to New York has slowed because of the high cost of living. Most of the the increases to its population come from internal migration within the US. 

The Jewish population of New York shrank significantly between 1950-1995ish, as Jews moved to the suburbs. The decline is probably linked to 'white flight', as throughout the US white middle-class and upper-class families left large city centres, particularly in the northwest.

However, the community has been growing since then. In the 1990s, about 100,000 former Soviet Jews immigrated to New York. Today, the Jewish community is now growing significantly because of the high Haredi birth rate, though this may be tempered as the cost of living in Brooklyn continues to increase and more Haredi communities move upstate."

173,e69k2p9,"Paywalled (part 1):

An earthquake is quietly rocking the Jewish world.

In the 18th century, Jews began playing a decisive role in the promotion of universalism, because universalism promised them redemption from their political subjection. Through universalism, Jews could, in principle, be free and equal to those who had dominated them. This is why, in the centuries that followed, Jews participated in disproportionate numbers in communist and socialist causes. This is also why Jews were model citizens of countries, such as France or the United States, with universalist constitutions.

The history of Jews as promoters of Enlightenment and universalist values, however, is drawing to a close. We are the stunned witnesses of new alliances between Israel, Orthodox factions of Judaism throughout the world, and the new global populism in which ethnocentrism and even racism hold an undeniable place.

When Prime Minister Netanyahu chose to align himself politically with Donald Trump before and after the U.S. presidential election of 2016, some people could still give him the benefit of doubt. Admittedly, Trump was surrounded by people like Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, who reeked of racism and anti-Semitism, but no one was sure of the direction the new presidency would take. Even if Trump refused to condemn the anti-Semitic elements of his electoral base or the Ku Klux Klan, which had enthusiastically backed him, and even if it took him a long time to dissociate himself from David Duke – we were not yet certain of the presence of anti-Semitism in Trump’s discourse and strategies (especially since his daughter Ivanka was a convert to Judaism).

But the events in Charlottesville in August 2017 no longer allowed for doubt. The neo-Nazi demonstrators committed violent acts against peaceful counter-protesters, killing one woman by plowing through a crowd with a car (an act reminiscent in its technique of terrorist attacks in Europe). Trump reacted to the events by condemning both the neo-Nazis and white supremacists and their opponents. The world was shocked by his conflation of the two groups, but Jerusalem did not object. Once again, the indulgent (or cynical) observer could have interpreted this silence as the reluctant obeisance of a vassal toward his overlord (of all the countries in the world, Israel receives the most military aid from the United States). One was entitled to think that Israel had no choice but to collaborate, despite the American leader’s outward signs of anti-Semitism.

This interpretation, however, is no longer tenable. Before and since Charlottesville, Netanyahu has courted other leaders who are either unbothered by anti-Semitism or straightforwardly sympathetic to it, and upon whom Israel is not economically dependent. His concessions go as far as participating in a partial form of Holocaust denial.

Take the case of Hungary. Under the government of Viktor Orban, the country shows troubling signs of legitimizing anti-Semitism. In 2015, for example, the Hungarian government announced its intention to erect a statue to commemorate Balint Homan, a Holocaust-era minister who played a decisive role in the murder or deportation of nearly 600,000 Hungarian Jews. Far from being an isolated incident, just a few months later, in 2016, another statue was erected in tribute to Gyorgy Donáth, one of the architects of anti-Jewish legislation during World War II. It was thus unsurprising to hear Orban employing anti-Semitic tropes during his reelection campaign in 2017, especially against Georges Soros, the Jewish, Hungarian-American billionaire-philanthropist who supports liberal causes, including that of open borders and immigration. Reanimating the anti-Semitic cliché about the power of Jews, Orban accused Soros of harboring intentions to undermine Hungary.

Whom did Netanyahu choose to support? Not the anxious Hungarian Jewish community that protested bitterly against the anti-Semitic rhetoric of Orban’s government; nor did he choose to support the liberal Jew Soros, who defends humanitarian causes. Instead, the prime minister created new fault lines, preferring political allies to members of the tribe. He backed Orban, the same person who resurrects the memory of dark anti-Semites. When the Israeli ambassador in Budapest protested the erection of the infamous statue, he was publicly contradicted by none other than Netanyahu.

To my knowledge, the Israeli government has never officially protested Orban’s anti-Semitic inclinations and affinities. In fact, when the Israeli ambassador in Budapest did try to do so, he was quieted down by Jerusalem. Not long before the Hungarian election, Netanyahu went to the trouble of visiting Hungary, thus giving a “kosher certificate” to Orban and exonerating him of the opprobrium attached to anti-Semitism and to an endorsement of figures active in the Shoah. When Netanyahu visited Budapest, he was given a glacial reception by the Federation of the Jewish Communities, while Orban gave him a warm welcome. To further reinforce their touching friendship, Netanyahu invited Orban to pay a reciprocal visit to Israel this past July, receiving him in a way usually reserved for the most devoted national allies.

The relationship with Poland is just as puzzling. As a reminder, Poland is governed by the nationalist Law and Justice party, which has an uncompromising policy against refugees and appears to want to eliminate the independence of the courts by means of a series of reforms that would allow the government to control the judiciary branch. In 2016 the Law and Justice-led government eliminated the official body whose mission was to deal with problems of racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance, arguing that the organization had become “useless.”

Encouraged by this and other governmental declarations and policies, signs of nationalism multiplied within Polish society. In February 2018, president Andrzej Duda declared that he would sign a law making it illegal to accuse the Polish nation of having collaborated with the Nazis. Accusing Poland of collusion in the Holocaust and other Nazi atrocities would be from now prosecutable. Israel initially protested the proposed legislation, but then in June, Benjamin Netanyahu and the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, signed an agreement exonerating Poland of any and all crimes against the Jews during the time of the German occupation. Israel also acceded to Poland’s move to outlaw the expression “Polish concentration camp.” Moreover, Netanyahu even signed a statement stipulating that anti-Semitism is identical to anti-Polonism, and that only a handful of sad Polish individuals were responsible for persecuting Jews – not the nation as a whole.

In July, that declaration was roundly condemned by Yad Vashem, as well as by a group of 21 Israeli historians, members of the Academy of Sciences and Humanities. But the stupefying result remained unchanged, with Netanyahu, the head of the Israeli government, giving his support to what amounts to a version of Holocaust denial. Netanyahu the history buff could not have been unaware that, in the words of Polish commentator Sawomir Sierakowski, “two-thirds of the 250,000 Jews who escaped during the Nazis’ ‘liquidation’ of Jewish ghettos in 1942 had been killed by 1945, most of them by Poles or with Polish participation.”

If Israel still had a moral standing on one topic (sadly probably the only remaining one), it is with regard to the Shoah, but Netanyahu undermined it by making the history and memory of the Holocaust a politically negotiable and tradable commodity. And if that’s not enough, earlier this month, Israel hosted Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte, a man who has proudly compared himself to Hitler.

This is a decisive turning point for Zionism, which places Netanyahu in an avant-garde of sorts, bringing the Revisionist Zionism he claims to represent to the final stage of its historical logic.

As a political doctrine and practice, traditional social-democratic Zionism had sought to find and maintain an equilibrium between three poles: Jewish communities in the Diaspora, Israel’s security interests, and international political alliances with the world’s strong democracies (cooperation with rogue states was for the most part unofficial). The memory of the Holocaust was the moral and ideological glue supporting and holding together this tripartite structure: Diaspora Jewry, Israel and enlightened nations were all determined that “never again” would such a crime take place against Jews or anyone else.

Yet for the first time in its history, Israel is putting the sensibility and interests of Jewish communities on the back burner. Israel and its government have even shown a willingness to desacralize the memory of the Shoah and make deals with open or hidden anti-Semites. This is a fascinating phenomenon, one that begs the question: Why is that the case?

Netanyahu here promotes a new vision of Zionism that demands a new international strategy, in response. Netanyahu has a deep political affinity to Trump, Orban and Morawiecki, and above all with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (During this summer’s Trump-Putin summit in Helsinki, the leaders declared their mutual admiration, which is now on display for all to see.) Netanyahu has lost interest in the mostly liberal American Jewish community not only because by predilection he prefers to cultivate a few rich people rather than groups and communities (except at election time), but also because he has a genuine and authentic contempt for liberalism (the American Jewish community is predominantly liberal).

"
174,e7tahpa,"I'm Canadian, but lived in the USA for a while some time ago. Like you, I was surprised at how enthusiastically American Thanksgiving was embraced by Jews there, relative to Canada. I do agree with you that in Canada, Thanksgiving is seen as a ""goyishe"" practice, and even fairly assimilated families just ignore it.

I think there are a few factors at play:

1. As you noted, Canadian Thanksgiving is close to the Yom-Tovim, so everyone has likely already seen their families recently.
2. American Thanksgiving is a much, much bigger deal than Canadian Thanksgiving, even among non-Jews. The amount of travel on American Thanksgiving (people going cross-country to visit families etc.) is incredible. It's bigger than Christmas, in many ways. 
3. The American Jewish community is ""older"" (based extensively on late 19th-century immigration) and perhaps feels more integrated into general US culture than the Canadian Jewish community, which is ""younger"" (based extensively on 1920s and post-WWII immigration) and has closer ties to ""the Old Country"".

I will say that there is something appealing about a universal secular holiday like American Thanksgiving, that has very few religious undertones. It's not something we have in Canada, and in the years I lived in the USA, I found it very hard to wrap my head around the idea (e.g. having Thanksgiving dinner at the home of Jewish Americans still felt very, very weird to me). 

An interesting contrast is that Americans take their Thanksgiving far more seriously than Canadians do theirs, while Canadians take their war-memorial holiday far more seriously than Americans do theirs. IMO. "
175,e7y9hk1,"&gt;That was with European money and intense pressure from the Americans in favor of Fatah. Give them an equal playing field and Hamas wins easily.

As I've stated and proved before, the majority of the West Bank supports Fatah over Hamas as of 2017. Making a scenario in which they both have an even playing field is a bit laughable, especially given that even if your statement was true it'd depend on Europe and the United States not trying to influence the elections; which we should both know is unlikely.

&gt;Europe has Runoff mostly with Ireland and Australia having IRV. What has America done to interfere with those systems?

I beg your pardon? What does that have anything to do with the argument? I made a point that Fatah lost to Hamas by 10,000 votes, with the 100,000 votes going to third parties with mostly peaceful views. Most countries have runoff systems that guarantees that the majority will be satisfied with their choices, but in the American-style election Palestinians had, it was unfortunately winner takes all. I only mentioned that it's an argument against the American system because it can lead to a terrorist group that goes against the beliefs of the majority. Bringing in Europe and Western countries is a complete non-point.

&gt;So what? The point was that the first anti-Jewish sentiment arose in the Christian community. What you were disputing that it started with Christians.

You stated that anti-Zionist sentiment arose from Christians before Zionists were a thing. However you failed to provide any sources before the Zionist active period in the early 20th century. Given that by 1911 most Arabs were seeing the effects of Jewish immigration (forced evictions) means your sources are still way to late to add credence to your argument.

&gt;I gave links from pre-Zionism as well. This one addressed the start of Palestinian nationalism.

And which link was that? Both links mention that they both were in response to Zionism, with the justification being land sales to Jews leading to Arabs being evicted. Furthermore, both links only deal with the early 20th century around 1911. When there were already Zionist owned-institutions dedicated to purchasing Arab land. Your sources would need to be during the late 19th century in order to prove your point that *""The Christian community was opposed to Jewish immigration long before there was Jewish Zionism.""*. Proving that there just was anti-Jewish immigration in the 1910's when there was already the existence of Zionism is not enough. 

&gt;If it was secular why would that belief exist among Christians and not Muslims? It was mostly Muslims being evicted. Your argument doesn't make any sense.

As I've iterated so, so, many times before. Palestinian Christians and Muslims both identify as Arabs. First off, ""mostly"" doesn't mean ""all"", all it takes is enough Christian Arabs to be evicted before sentiments soured. Secondly, because you insist on Muslims being the ""big bad"" doesn't mean that lines up with reality. Palestinian Christians were and currently are being treated as badly as Palestinian Muslims; they legitimately don't hate each other, and tend to be very pragmatic. By the logic you've thus-far presented, there should be a lot more riots against Christians from Muslims too; but that's not the case. 

&gt;I'm not disputing why they left. I'm disputing your claim that the Muslims don't oppress them. You are changing the subject.

I'm not changing the subject, you still haven't presented any definite proof that Palestinian Muslims oppress Palestinian Christians. Just your opinions that they would, a rare harassment against foreign Pilgrims resulting in a stabbed priest, and a stray line about how people prefer to sell land to others of their faith. Meanwhile, I've shown that Palestinian Christians are woefully unlikely to gain sympathies to Israel and aren't being alienated from the Palestinian Muslim community.

&gt;That quote is one guy who doesn't represent the community. 

Alright, what about [Jerusalem approving](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5180260) Jew-only parking spots on a location that used to be used by residents living in the Armenian Quarter?

&gt;About the issue that Israel doesn't care about but that Turkey does. 

Still alienates the Armenian community from Israel. Israel has been more supportive of Azerbaijan over Armenia for the past few decades. Arguing that they are friendly with the Jewish community is an overstatement.

&gt;In both Israel and the USA the Armenian and Jewish communities are united.

Well American-Armenians aren't particularly [happy](http://asbarez.com/174504/what-would-happen-if-an-armenian-diplomat-questions-the-term-holocaust-while-in-israel/) with [Israel](http://asbarez.com/172393/israeli-lawmakers-play-the-genocide-card-again/).

&gt;The Armenian quarter is well preserved. The people are happy.

Except when their parking spots are taken away, and they begin feeling marginalized by Israel. Especially when Israel failed to recognize their Patriarch elections until months after the fact, while Palestinian and Jordanian leaders did so within days.

&gt;And moreover like the Christians they are free to leave if they find Israeli society so horrible.

Lol. Palestinian Christians have ties to their homeland as much as anyone else who was born there.

&gt;Rather than leaving Armenians are emigrating to Israel.

How many sources do you really have proving that? There are about 10,000 Armenians living throughout Israel in 2015. How fast is that number growing? Truly.

&gt;Armenians are simply are not the hateful ungrateful people you make them out to be.

They certainly aren't the happy-go-lucky people you make them out to be either.

&gt; But rather they are fine people and willing allies. They are compelled to enlist in the IDF yet do so in large numbers.

There is 10,000 of them, how large is the number they're enlisting in? Furthermore, can you prove that by showing the demographic-trends of the IDF?  One soldier being Armenian isn't enough.

&gt;I'm not sure why you would be so insistent on denying the obvious.

Well that's overly dismissive coming from someone who thus far has been using their own opinions on how they think things should be rather than concrete facts.

&gt;Yeah the horror they get to live in a quarter of the old city they can't fill. They got an upgrade.

Reading Comprehension. It was *literally* in the same sentence referring to Arab Christians. 

&gt;If you are going to consider a community that lives under Israeli law, supports Israel publicly, has good relations with the USA Jewish community, pays taxes, volunteers for the IDF not flipped then it is impossible.

And you've not proven one of those things of yet. 

&gt;If on the other hand you consider a community flipped when they follow the law, participate in the society economically, culturally and socially and don't support fanatics who blow up pizza parlors and nightclubs then yes I think the Christians can be flipped. 

Well given that Armenians aren't even that supportive of Israel, and plenty of Palestinian Christians are leaders or have been leaders in the past for the Palestinian Independence movement that is unlikely; your thoughts aren't evidence.

&gt;They can easily end up in a generation or so like the Armenians.

The Christians outnumber the Armenians at about 20:1.

And since I missed these links in your quotes I might as well get to these too. The first one(biased to all hell too) has literally no sources to its claims  and the second one is a rant from a former-Israeli liason named Yoram Ettinger. Furthermore it still doesn't prove your statement that Bethlehem has somehow grown by 30k Muslims. The sheer fact that Bethlehem still has a Christian Mayor should disprove your statements. The real question is if any of those events are true why aren't those balant attacks against Christians even reported by other Israeli news sources?"

In particular, there are now more than 300 children separated from their parents who have been placed in facilities around New York, and UJA and our partners are in daily conversations about ways we can help.

&gt;But in the next breath Goldstein goes to Israel, and he has no sympathy at all for the Palestinian refugees in Gaza who are marching to be able to return to villages on land that is now Israel– thousands of whom have been shot, and more than 130 killed.

&gt;All Goldstein’s sympathy is for Israelis living near the border, “where life has become increasingly difficult.” Palestinians are afraid of bullets, but these Israelis are afraid of… kites and balloons!

&gt;It’s as if the Israelis are experiencing a famine (as Scott Roth says). Goldstein is simply unrelenting in his sympathy with the Israelis. There is not one word about Palestinians, except a sharp kick in the shins of Palestinian history.

Unfortunately, only European leftist parties have reached this point

American ""leftist"" parties (including Ortez) are continuing the status quo of some light criticism

&gt;Cory Booker Apologizes for Holding Up Anti-Israeli Sign, Explains That He Thought It Was Merely an Anti-American Sign


&gt;Sen. Cory Booker, seen as a likely contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, appears in a photo appearing to endorse a slogan of the pro-Palestinian movement.

&gt;A Booker spokesman told JTA the senator had no idea the sign had anything to do with Israel.

&gt;Booker, a New Jersey Democrat who is known for his closeness to the Jewish community, is seen posing while holding a sign reading “From Palestine to Mexico, all the walls have got to go” and depicting a crumbling brick wall. The slogan was coined by the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, which posted the photo Friday on Twitter.

&gt;The sign likens President Trump’s Mexican wall proposal to Israel’s security barrier.

&gt;A spokesman for Booker, Jeff Giertz, said Booker believed the sign referred only to Mexico.

&gt;“Just before delivering a speech in New Orleans, Senator Booker was approached by dozens of people for photos,” Giertz told JTA in an email.

&gt;“In one instance, amid the rush, he was posing for a photo and was passed a sign to hold – he didn’t have time to read the sign, and from his cursory glance he thought it was talking about Mexico and didn’t realize it had anything to do with Israel,” Giertz said. …

&gt;Israel’s Jewish Essence Is Non-Negotiable: A Response to Mahmoud Abbas


&gt;No mention of Kings David and Solomon, nor of the prophets Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Amos, or of the great Jewish sage Rabbi Akiva, or of Hillel and Shammai, the most prominent members of Jerusalem’s Sanhedrin, the Jewish High Court, around the very time of Jesus Christ’s birth. Abbas failed to recall Yokhanan ben Zakkai who established his yeshiva at Yavneh only decades later, or, for that matter, Yehuda Ha-Nasi, who compiled and edited the Mishna, the compilation of the oral tradition that forms the first section of the Talmud, in the second century of the Common Era. All these men lived in Abbas’s “Holy Land, the land of Palestine” long before the birth of Muhammad. Indeed, the very words “Jews” and “Jewish” are conspicuously absent from Abbas’s speech.

&gt;Abbas’s deliberate refusal to acknowledge that before either Christianity or Islam ever appeared on the historical or theological scene, Judaism had been firmly ensconced in what is today the State of Israel, speaks volumes.

&gt;White Nationalism: A Scourge That Won’t Go Away

&gt;Reacting to the inclusion of the “white nationalist” anti-immigration activist Peter Brimelow on a panel on “The Failure of Multiculturalism: How the Pursuit of Diversity Is Weakening the American Identity” at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Ed Schultz observed on MSNBC’s The Ed Show that, “We’ve come to expect CPAC to bring together the far righties. But even CPAC should draw the line somewhere.”

&gt;Schultz went on to quote Brimelow as having said at CPAC that, “Democrats have given up on winning the white working class vote, so they use bilingualism to build up a client constituency. It’s treason. We hear about racism, but the real issue is treason.”

&gt;...Back in 2002, the conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg wrote in the Los Angeles Times that Brimelow, Pat Buchanan and Sam Francis [see below] “have become dismayingly obsessed in recent years with creating... an ‘identity politics for white people.’”

178,e15y57l,"You don't think there is a reason behind this idea? You believe it comes out of no where and that it's because people don't like Jews because they are 'different?'  That jews have been forcibly expelled from hundreds and hundreds of nations/communities over the past 1000 years in wildly different cultures comes down to simple ""people hate jews because they are mean to jews."" That makes zero sense, the only common denominator in all the persecution jews have faced is jews themselves. There is obviously some component of jewishness that acts politically to cause strife between ethnic groups, and its so bad that it results in genocide time and time again.

In recent times jews have been responsible for communism, cultural marxism/relativism, predatory lending, extreme nepotism and jewish supremacy thats always deflected off as 'white supremacy.' You have a core component of people wanting mass immigration into the west from the 3rd world from jewish leaders and public figures, you ask them to have the same mass immigration to Israel and you are suddenly ""anti-semtic"" for asking they do they same.  The double standards and hypocrisy from the jewish community is mind boggling, and you are always 'anti-semetic' if you dare to suggest jews be criticized as every other ethnic group is.  

If you separated whites from jews demographically, and then showed all these stats that are used to support the claim of ""white supremacy,"" people wouldn't be complaining about 'white supremacy,' they'd be complaining about 'jewish supremacy.'"
179,e0iy4g6,"The Canadian Jewish community is smaller than the US Jewish community in both absolute numbers and per\-capita. There are, very roughly, about 400,000 Jews in Canada, out of a total population of about 36M. About 50&amp;#37; live in the Toronto area, about 25&amp;#37; in the Montreal area, and the rest scattered in other big cities (Ottawa, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton etc.) Of that 25&amp;#37; in the Montreal area, about one\-quarter are Sephardim. 

The Canadian Jewish community tends to be much more traditional than the US Jewish community. There is less intermarriage here, and the ritual practice of each movement tends to be more ""traditional"" than that of the US counterpart. As an example, Conservative shuls in Canada started going egalitarian only relatively recently (the early 2000s IIRC). An Orthodox NYC friend of mine says, in reference to the Toronto MO community, that ""everyone's just so frum there"". 

There are a few reasons for this, but I think the major one is that the Canadian Jewish community is ""closer to the old country"". The bulk of Jewish immigration to Canada happened in the 1920s and then after the war vs. the late 19th c. immigration in the US (there were certainly Jews in Canada in the late 19th c., but a comparatively small number). As a result, those of us in our 30s and 40s tend to have had at least a couple of European\-born grandparents who immigrated to Canada in their teens or early 20s, and consequently many of us have parents who grew up speaking Yiddish at home. It's a different dynamic."
180,dz69udj,"The Finnish Jewish community is very small, as it consists of about 1 800 people. Most of them are descendants of Russian Jews who came to Finland in the 19th century, when Finland was part of the Russian Empire. When Finland declared its independence in 1917, Jews were granted full rights as Finnish citizens. During the second world war a total of 350 Finnish Jews served in the Finnish army.  


After Israel's establishment, Finland had a high rate of immigration to Israel, which depleted Finland's Jewish community. The community was somewhat revitalized when some Soviet Jews immigrated to Finland following the collapse of the Soviet Union.


There are two synagogues in Finland: one in Helsinki and one in Turku. Most Finnish Jews speak Finnish or Swedish as their mother tongue. Finnish Jews seem quite assimilated and I don't think any of them wear traditional dress. Some famous Finnish Jews include member of parliament Ben Zyskowicz and reporter Ruben Stiller. 
"
181,dxoyi1h,"I don't really think that this is some kind of devastating admission of duplicity. Everyone who has even a passing knowledge of Jewish culture in America knows that Jews have a palpable sense of ethnocentrism and loyalty to Israel. It isn't Jewish ethnocentrism and loyalty to the Zionist ethnostate which rubs the Alt-Right the wrong way. It's the hypocrisy and double standards which draw our ire. Jews want to be able to engage in ethnocentrism among themselves while simultaneously demonizing and eradicating White gentile ethnocentrism. And even that hypocrisy wouldn't really piss us off if Jews were the powerless victims that they portray themselves as. It's the hypocritical ""ethnocentrism for me, but not for thee"" mindset of Jews combined with the immense amount of institutional and cultural power and influence that Jews have in our society which causes us to despise them. 

If a couple hundred thousand White gentiles moved to Israel and swiftly dominated Israel's financial system, news media, entertainment industry, NGOs, government sector, academic institutions, et cetera, and were constantly pimping concepts like Jewish privilege, Jewish guilt, Jewish supremacy (in a negative sense), open borders, mass immigration, and diversity, and if we also created highly influential ""anti-hate"" organizations that were constantly monitoring Israeli society for even the slightest hints of Jewish ethnocentrism and anti-gentile racism while engaging in ethnocentrism ourselves and sending billions of Israeli tax dollars to White gentile countries... then I don't really think that you could blame the Israelis for creating the Jewish equivalent of the Alt-Right in order to combat subversive White gentile power and influence in their country. 

The Alt-Right would actually support Zionism if Jews didn't play a central role in cucking the White race. After all, most Ashkenazi Jews are basically a White ethnic group that really aren't all that different than the other White ethnic groups that are on the borders of Whiteness when you look at Fst values, phenotype, and culture. So, Israel is essentially a White supremacist colony in the Middle East. And the Alt-Right admires ethnic groups with high IQs and low crime rates. So, there's no inherent reason why we couldn't have a mutually beneficial relationship. It's the one-sided nature of this relationship which is radicalizing the Alt-Right. 

The history of animosity between White gentiles and Jews goes back about 2,000 years, but we're still willing to bury the hatchet with them if they're willing to bury the hatchet with us so that we can work towards achieving common goals, but they want us to bend over backwards for them as they spit in our face. *That's* what's fueling anti-Jewish sentiment within the Alt-Right. Jews would never tolerate subversive and hostile White gentiles taking over Israeli society, and yet they expect us to just blindly trust them. And if we refuse to blindly trust them, then they'll assassinate our reputations and do everything within their power to completely ruin our lives. 

This one-sided, exploitative relationship is completely unsustainable and will inevitably result in yet another wave of anti-Jewish sentiment as Whites get closer and closer to becoming minorities in their own countries and as they research who exactly is responsible for creating and spreading this anti-White agenda. And, like usual, Jews will play the innocent victim and pretend that they did absolutely nothing to provoke this latest wave of anti-Jewish sentiment. At least we White gentiles actually have the intellectual honesty to acknowledge that we played a role in radicalizing Jews through past abuses. When will a significant percentage of Jews take some responsibility for this latest wave of anti-Jewish sentiment and acknowledge that the Alt-Right's hostility towards Jewish influence in their societies actually has some merit?

Until the Jewish community is willing to acknowledge that the Alt-Right actually has a point and concedes some moral ground to us, then there's never going to be a productive and sustainable relationship between White gentiles and Jews. We're not asking for much. We're not asking for Jews to abandon their Jewishness or to abandon their support for Israel. We're merely asking for them to stop demonizing perfectly healthy levels of White ethnocentrism, to stop engaging in open borders activism, and to stop pushing harmful moral degeneracy on our people. If Jews aren't willing to show us that most basic level of common courtesy, then we're going to do everything in our power to screw them over as well. "
182,duuorz7,"Israel is also not a perfect state by any stretch of the imagination, as is the racial state of the Jewish people. There is enormous stratification within the Jewish community, with Ashkenazim (the most White Jews) being basically the master race.

Israel also pursues very much a racially aware policy regarding immigration. For instance there was huge controversy regarding Black Jews which were denied Israeli citizenship under the law of return (I think, ethiopian Jews: http://www.rense.com/general25/rct.htm, http://www.newsweek.com/2016/10/07/why-ethiopian-jews-israel-face-discrimination-racism-police-brutality-502697.html).

And yes, of course, you can weld different groups into a single identity, but for it to work you have to have closely related ethnic groups to begin with (a good example is the unification of Germany). Of course you can ""unite"" various unrelated ethnic groups (USA, Brazil, etc), but even with a strong culture there will always be strife and lack of harmony.

The Jewish community is also an exception because it has a genetic uniqueness with its matriarchal line. Even with lots of mixing, the Jewishness can remain apparent if the mother remains Jewish. That leads to close ethnic cooperation. Though I will not deny that Jewish culture is strong too.

My advice for Israel would be the same regardless: They should keep the trash out and try to conduct eugenics on their own population to develop further the good genes (Israeli labs are already on the forefront of this, they just dont call it eugenics). Israelis are fully aware of the racial aspect of things."
183,dvx3qdu,"Little italies and Chinatowns have no political power and as such tend to dissapear without steady immigration. More to the point, Italy and China already have autonomous national communities and are thus not seriously under threat. Yet I don't see you ranting about the existence of China or Italy.

Taking palestinian land to preserve a zionist national community is as wrong as residential schools if not worse

The land in the 1930s was legally acquired, in the first place. In the second place, there was already an indigenous Jewish community that had been there for 3000 years. In the third place there is zero reason why a Jewish homeland cannot and should not exist. You're assuming too that a Jewish community is only a means of protecting Jews. But by the same token it may well be protecting the Palestinians fro having their culture die out since Hebrew may well end up as the more prestigious language. Palestinians should have a national community and so should the Jews, and there is no reason that this could not have been settled diplomatically. That's all I have to say about that.

&gt;When your national community wont allow others in thats pretty messed up

Generally speaking they can let in whoever they want. The intention though is to provide a homeland for a particular cultural group, which I don't think is unreasonable at all. "

You're probably being downvoted for accusing us of having suspicion or hatred of American whites, which is a pretty ridiculous assertion. To give you an idea, intermarriage in the American Jewish community is around 50%, and the overwhelming majority of those intermarried partners are white. Most American Jews are not Orthodox and largely assimilated into generic white American culture. When it comes to Jews on the left, it is true that a majority are democrats, but it's unclear whether this is really so extremely disproportionate for generally affluent coastal city dwellers (ie. archetypal 'blue tribe' in SSC parlance) which we mostly are. Most of the recent social justice activism, far from being some evil conspiracy by us against whites, equally targets Jews - when people talk about reducing the proportion of white men in Hollywood, guess what - Jeffrey Katzenberg, JJ Abrams and so on are all counted as white in that calculation. And that's not to even touch on specific stuff like BDS. 

&gt;that Jews have been at the forefront of opposing any attempts to keep the United States as a majority-white nation. 

So have Irish - in fact arguably Irish activism and an Irish Catholic president were far more important to the 1965 bill than Jews, yet of course modern white nationalists have no problem with Irish people. 

&gt;white nationalists and orthodox Zionists are united by a common thread of thought. 

Most Orthodox Zionists, for all their problems, don't want to remove all Jews from America, which appears to be the present 'alt right' position. Unsurprisingly, that's not really negotiable from our perspective. 

&gt;The ""antisemitism"" of white nationalism comes not from any inherent disdain for Jews as a people

It does, though. It's right there in their frequent use of nazi-era terminology and propaganda, in their repurpose of old-school blood libel, in their language of us as parasites and leeches, in their desire for expulsion or extermination, in their painting of us as secret masterminds of mass immigration, rapacious capitalism, all-powerful socialism/welfare and 'white genocide', in their vicious and unrelenting caricature of us as a 'race', and in their visceral hatred of our religion (inc. especially, for some reason, talmud). That is hatred, and it's far stronger and deeper than any opposition to our support for some twentieth century immigration policy. 

---

Personally, as a right wing, somewhat reactionary (in the Moldbug sense) Jew, I sympathise with some of these people on the american right. However, they should realise that, while mass immigration is problematic and I personally oppose it myself, their struggle and suffering comes much more from the loss of their own religious, cultural and ethnic traditions over the last century or so, than it does from recent demographic change. Most WN's solely define themselves in opposition to other racial, ethnic or religious groups, and that's both unhealthy for them and dangerous for everyone else around them. I can't support people who hate me, deport me, kill me or strip me of any rights and dignity. "
185,drtt039,"This is the results the globalist wanted. What's not to get, Israel is a Jewish state and the world wide Jewish community is going to be forced to go back to their own country. you really think Germans or anybody else for that matter would bring in a nonsensical evil in their own county to create a wave of terror to send people packing back where they came from. You're a foolish person if you can't connect the dots to see the worlds greatest deception that is at work, the name of the game is population replacement and it itself will become the biggest issue the likes of which that makes illegal immigration seem tame."

Yeah — black African boys and men having their genitals mutilated, who cares? Only women count.

&gt; I'm just not convinced that it is as pressing a problem comparatively in the uk

Of course not. FGM is performed on females; whilst MGM is performed on males. So who cares about the boys and men eh?

&gt; there is a limited appetite to social change.

When in comes to males being mutilated — sure. 

&gt; I'm just not convinced that it is as pressing a problem comparatively in the uk... I'm most happy to be proved wrong with data.

How many female are actually subject to FGM *physically within* the UK?  From April 2015 to March 2016 only 18 cases were reported as being undertaken in the UK.

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/21/england-fgm-cases-recorded-2015-2016

And 10 of those were voluntary genital piercings of adults. So that leave just 8 recorded cases of true FGM of un-concenting infant females:

http://content.digital.nhs.uk/article/7180/First-ever-annual-statistical-publication-for-FGM-shows-5700-newly-recorded-cases-during-2015-16

Male genital mutilation is practiced almost universally within the Muslim population, so that means that on 2011 census figures, there are around 1,350,000 male victims of MGM in the UK:

http://www.mcb.org.uk/muslimstatistics/

And each year around 40,000 Muslim infants or young boys will subject to MGM:

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10562574/Almost-a-tenth-of-babies-and-toddlers-in-England-and-Wales-are-Muslim-census-figures-show.html

Around 1,930 male Jews are born annually, and MGM in the Jewish community is not universal, but it is very common. So we can estimate that 80% of these will be subject to MGM, giving a figure of 1,544 infant male jews mutilated annually:

https://www.bod.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CommunityStatistics2012.pdf

In addition to these figures, we have to add other infant boys and males of African origin who come from genital mutilating countries, such as Somalian Christians, Filipino Christians etc. Plus various other such infant boys born to parents from the USA who live in the UK. Approximately 65% of all infant boys in the USA are subject to MGM. Let's call that another 1,000 infant males and boys subject to MGM annually.


So the ""data"" is **8** cases of FGM vs **42,544** cases of MGM

Happy?

&gt; gross anecdotes

250 photographs of mutilated male penis, (and a few dead bodies as a result of MGM) is an ""anecdote"" I suppose."
187,dict8f7,"Those comments. 

&gt;Labour loves Muslims more than jews and Muslims hate jews. What did they expect would happen. Labour is clearly becoming anti-semitic.

&gt;Closer inspection of history of course yields the reality Islam was always a violent, supremacist force in the region, with peaceful periods rarely lasting.

&gt;Most Jews in the U.S. vote for DEMS. DEMS love MUSLIMS not Jews!

&gt;When the time comes (and it is coming) when the Muslim population is big enough to form its own political party, THEN Labour will be finished.

&gt;Exactly the same thing will happen to the democrats in the US. They think if they import a majority of mexicans they'll keep voting Democrat.. The stupidity of the left is truly monumental.

&gt;No it is not, just look at how they have infested and long since controlled the MSM, academia, all state institutions, public sector management, services, charities and anything and everything taxpayer funded.

&gt;The French dystopian novel ""Submission"" predicted an islamic takeover of France in alliance with left wing parties. Current events and predicted demographics are suggesting that this fiction will become reality sooner or later.

&gt;Most American Jews need to get their head out of their a$$es and vote Republican, voting Democrat is voting for their own demise, Democrats hate Israel and Jews

&gt;Voting for the party that was once the Tories will not help. The only party that is making a stab at trying to deal with the muslim menace (which is really the only threat to the Jewish community) is UKIP. They don't go nearly far enough but there it is.

&gt;British Jews abandon Labour because Labour functionates as a pawn for the goals of Islamists

&gt;Labour's anti-semitism is a cynical strategy to attract the Muslim vote.They know that by attacking Jews, Muslims will vote for them in droves. But to ensure as many votes as possible, they must ensure more and more Muslims come into the country.

&gt;When you fill your party with rabid anti-Semitic intolerant racist muslims what do you expect???

&gt;At least the Jews have a homeland that they can escape too but where do British people go?

&gt;Let's see, they brought in a bunch of Muslim migrants, and now there is anti semitism... Imagine that.

&gt;Of course 100% of the muslim vote will go labour and lots more muslims than jews...

&gt;Look Labour imported Muslims to do what they didn't have the guts to do.

&gt;fuqq the jews, never mind about their little cabal, WHAT ABOUT THE COUNTRY THEY RESIDE IN !


&gt;Yeah it's anti semitic to point out a group controls the money supply. Slaves.

&gt;The Jews are less important than the Muslims

&gt;Who cares what the Jews do? This is the result of mass uncontrolled immigration from Muslim lands, we all have to suffer, get over it.

"
188,eu8khob,"We can learn a lot from ultraorthodox Jews.

&gt;While Haredim made up just 9.9% of the Israeli population in 2009, with 750,000 out of 7,552,100, by 2014, that figure had risen to 11.1%, with 910,500 Haredim out of a total Israeli population of 8,183,400. According to a December 2017 study conducted by the Israeli Democracy Institute, the number of Haredi Jews in Israel exceeded 1 million in 2017, making up 12% of the population in Israel. By 2030, the Haredi Jewish community is projected to make up 16% of the total population, and by 2065, one third of the Israeli population.

&gt;The number of Haredi Jews in Israel is rising rapidly. The number of children per woman is 6.2, and the share of Haredim among those under the age of 20 was 16.3% in 2009 (29% of Jews).

They are going to end up dominating Israeli politics. If American identitarians had these kind of birthrates plus our already fairly high ""conversion"" rates, we would be on our way to being 50% of the white population in two generations. The only problem with the revenge of the cradle strategy is that a bigger population requires more resources and puts a worse strain on the planet and it can be dysgenic. We would need to find a way to encourage our average people to have 3 children while the above average have 4+ and the below average have 2 or fewer. Easy and free access to contraceptives and abortion, encouraging long-term birth control for people on public assistance, and natalist propaganda targeted at the educated might help."
189,eqaqzvm,"&gt; Why are you using Jews and Marxists as if they are interchangeable?

He's not. He referred to the Jewish/Marxist elites, which are the dominating force in the ""left wing"".

 This is different from the Jewish/right-wing elites which dominate the ""right wing"".

And of course, **most American Jews are NOT part of the elites**.

Saying that Jews make up the majority of the elites, is **not** the same as saying that most Jews are part of the elites.

Visualize a Venn diagram.   

 The American Jewish community is 1.7% of American society. So 1.7% of 330 mil is 5.6 mil

The elites who dominate American society are probably around 200,000 people. If Jews make up 60% of that 200,000 elites, that's 120,000 Jewish elites.

So the 120,000 Jews who are part of the elites are still only 120k/5.6million = 2.2% of the American Jewish community.

In this hypothetical scenario, the vast majority of American Jews are NOT part of the elites who dominate American. However, the majority of the elites are Jews."
190,ecbalxu,"Article text:

John McDonnell, the softly spoken “street orator” and avowed Marxist intent on colonising the centre ground, is running late. Stephen Kinnock, a persistent Corbyn critic working with the Tories for a softer Brexit, emerges first from his office. A few minutes later comes Ivan Lewis, who resigned from the party the next day in protest at the Labour leader’s failure to address antisemitism.

Mr McDonnell, 67, was once seen as the menace behind Jeremy Corbyn’s grandfatherly charm. In recent months, however, he has emerged as the figure to whom Labour moderates turn for reason. The shadow chancellor is doing his damndest to hold Labour’s dysfunctional family together.

How much did his long spell running a small children’s home with his first wife prepare him for what he does today?

“The one thing you try and have when you’re looking after children is empathy,” he says.

“I think that’s the most valuable lesson, empathy as much as possible. But, at the same time, with children you have to set parameters as well. What I try and do is empathise as much as possible but also set a few parameters.”

He says that he has been talking to all sides of his party, which represents some of the most pro-Leave and pro-Remain seats in the country. Some Labour MPs believe the leadership is dragging its feet over a no confidence vote in the government because it is committed to considering another Brexit referendum if it fails to trigger a general election.

Mr McDonnell denies that. He has “always urged people to be savvy” about a no confidence vote, he says.

Will Labour table one in January if, as expected, MPs vote down Theresa May’s Brexit proposals? He cautions against making predictions, saying: “It depends on those unique circumstances and, of course, it depends on the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).”

If the party does move on to examine other options, including another referendum, he suggests that Labour members hoping for a say will be disappointed. Asked if the rank and file would decide the party’s stance on another Brexit vote, he replies: “I can’t see it, but anything can happen. At the moment, it’ll be the usual consultations that will decide it.”

These discussions will take place within the shadow cabinet and among Labour MPs, he says.

He smiles at the mention of the DUP, the kingmakers in a hung parliament because of their confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives. As a supporter of a united Ireland Mr McDonnell is far from a natural bedfellow for the staunch Unionists.

However, he says that the two of them could have a fruitful relationship if Labour were in government. “This is a funny thing, I know — despite our differences around the issue around united Ireland and matters related to that, I’ve always had a good relationship with them,” he says.

He has always been able to talk to DUP MPs, he says, because “it’s always been on the basis of this is where we stand on a number of issues. Remember, they have a very large working-class community that they represent.”

“I can see a joint working programme,” he adds. “I can see them voting for policies that we’d advocate when we get into government.”

These would include “social investment, tackling the social security crisis that they’ve got in Northern Ireland, building the homes that they need, making sure their schools are properly funded and the NHS properly funded”.

Before any of this, Labour first has to win a general election and the next one is not due until 2022. Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, is working with the party on its preparations for government.

Also involved, perhaps more surprisingly, are figures from the New Labour era. Mr Corbyn, 69, was famously a thorn in the side of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s governments, voting against them 500 times.

Nevertheless, those prepared to help the party include Labour’s last prime minister, says Mr McDonnell. Eleven years ago, Mr McDonnell was the only Labour MP to try to halt Mr Brown’s coronation as party leader and prime minister, although he couldn’t muster enough support from colleagues to make it into a contest.

“Gordon Brown and others have always said that whatever assistance we need is open to us.” He even says he wants to build on Mr Brown’s legacy.

One of the issues the shadow chancellor says that the party is keen to address is “how can we make sure that we’re tackling the problems of child poverty, which Gordon Brown went so far on, but we think we’ve got to set a target of eliminating it”.

A Treasury under Mr McDonnell would be given a mandate to look at inequality and climate change. And, despite the criticism the party would face, he is unafraid to talk of Soviet-style five-year plans.

His Treasury would begin a spending review in the first year, he says. “The spending reviews at the moment are three-year programmes. We’re looking for a five-year programme. The idea behind that is to start setting targets around each element of expenditure as well,” he says.

He is also preparing for an emergency budget within two months of getting into power. Labour has told the Office for Budget Responsibility to cut the time it takes to prepare for a budget from ten to eight weeks to “have the budget as soon as we possibly can”.

With Labour setting out its stall, Mr McDonnell is asking for input into the appointment of the next Bank of England governor, even though he is still shadow chancellor. Although Mark Carney is not due to leave until January 2020, replacing him will be a long process.

An independent report for Labour on financial services includes “a significantly new role for the Bank of England for a strategic investment board, so the idea is to make sure whoever goes into that role recognises the key role that they’ll play in direct investment”, he says.

Labour accused the government of stealing a number of its policies in October’s budget. Mr McDonnell says that the party should be flattered and denies that it is a sign that he and Mr Corbyn are not radical enough.

“Yes, they steal [policies] but they’re really so useless they can’t implement them effectively,” he says. “They do it in a half-hearted way. They’re not really committed, so it’s just seen as tokenism, really.”

He adds: “It means we’re winning the arguments. It commonsense socialism. We’re all socialists now.”

Perhaps with one notable exception, he concedes, although he then claims: “Theresa May wants to be a socialist.”

He adds that he had recently handed some Tory MPs in the Commons chamber “an application to join the Labour Party. I suggested that some of them might want to look at it.”

It is the Corbyn-led Labour party that occupies the centre ground, he says. “I think we’re identifying the issues that need to be addressed. We’re identifying the solutions that people generally accept are the right solutions and we’re dominating in terms of the intellectual debate.

“However you judge it, if you’ve got a majority of opinion, obviously you are demonstrating you’re right the way across to be the centre. Of course you have to. You have to capitalise the centre if you’re going to get into government. That’s what we’ve done, we’ve expanded our base.”

That leaves an obvious question. How do you translate that into votes? The answer, he says, is in “more effective communication of those ideas using whatever mechanisms we possibly can, using whatever media we can”.

One of the fears of many centrist Labour MPs is that they will be deselected by their local parties and replaced by Corbynites. Mr McDonnell says he thinks that deselections will continue to be very rare. However, he appears to suggest that it is up to MPs to make sure it does not happen to them.

“It’s not difficult to maintain a good relationship with your constituency party,” he says.

“It really isn’t, because even where there’s difficult differences, there’s an understanding that there will be difficult differences. As long as you represent the party effectively and as long as you do the work on the ground, it’s very rare to deselect someone.”

He does believe that the party needs to do more to improve its relationship with the Jewish community after months of accusations of antisemitism.

Mr Lewis, who is Jewish, accused the Labour leadership of delaying an investigation into sexual harassment claims against him for political reasons but also told Mr Corbyn: “All too often you have been unwilling to condemn those whose hatred of Israel becomes Jew hatred.”

Mr McDonnell says that the party’s relationship with the Jewish community is one “we work at all the time”.

He says that Labour is also working hard to “make sure this society isn’t divided because of the Brexit issue. I’m really worried about that.”

Some have accused Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell of being dangerous radicals. Instead, he insists, they are boring. He reveals that the last Christmas present he received from his party leader was the tie of his beloved Liverpool Football Club.

The last gift he gave Mr Corbyn, who makes jam from his own fruit, was a book on the history of allotments.

“I think it was either for his birthday or Christmas,” he laughs. “Are we stereotypical or what? We’re boring, aren’t we? Well, he loved it.”

He adds: “Then I got him another book, it was the history of the railway system, because they’re his two loves.”

When he is not preparing for a socialist government, Mr McDonnell is learning to play the trombone and in particular When the Saints go Marching In, with its references to the Book of Revelation.

He admits that, as tunes go, “it’s the simplest and easiest one. I haven’t had much time to practise.”

He hopes that soon all the hard work will pay off, and instead of Labour backbenchers filing out of his office, it will be some of the most important players in world finance.

191,f9uge4g,"My DD married a Jewish man and his mother might be the end of their marriage. She is upset that her DIL is Catholic and not willing to convert. She even tries to convert me and my DH. She says she had a Catholic friend when she was a teenager so she knows all about that religion. I don’t even know everything about Catholicism and that’s what we are, sort of. (We don’t actively practice or go to church so I guess we are bad Catholics.) She keeps pushing Jewish classes on us every time we see her and thinks we need to know more. Our very good friends of forty years are Jewish and we participate in Jewish related activities with them so we are not oblivious. DD is a typical ‘Shiksa’, at least that is what her MIL thinks. There is currently a critical situation in their marriage because of his mother being so overbearing and poisoning her son’s mind against his wife (DD). The latest example is SonIL went to Thanksgiving the day before at his parents house and stayed overnight and didn’t come back till late Thanksgiving night. While he’s there she spends her time getting into his head and shit talks DD so he comes home under the influence of his mommy. He then starts fights with DD because he starts believing what mommy says. She is angry because she wants to own the holidays and even had SonIL try to invite us, DD’s parents who she hates, to Thanksgiving next year. She is trying to call dibs now. DD is as LC as she can get because being around this toxic woman makes her physically ill. SonIL has lost jobs because of her influence, then she calls his ex employer to ask them, “Don’t you know my son has a condition??!!..,” And he does have a condition because serious mental illness runs in her family. Her sister died in a mental institution and she was a paranoid schizophrenic. She does the typical a Jewish mother guilt thing to everyone, but other mothers dole out guilt pretty well too on here. 

To top it off, the Jewish community is fairly close knit and they all know OF each other, if they don’t know each other personally. DD’s MIL will call my Jewish friend to complain about DD. She has no idea why MIL does this. She used to call me to complain about DD but I stopped answering the phone so she is angry at me. My friend says EVERYONE knows MIL’s side of the family are crazy, at least that’s what the gossip is. She is relentless and thinks she is righteous in whatever she does. Hard to say how much is the undiagnosed and untreated mental illness and how much is a Jewish thing. Btw, my Jewish friend’s mom is awesome so it’s probably mental illness using religion as a club to beat people with. 

You can make your own latkes, they are easy to make. Just watch out for your knuckles in the grater. We are Polish and my grandma made them all the time too and she was not Jewish. My friend and I make them together because they are tasty. Maybe it’s an Eastern European thing? (latkes, not abuse) Google a recipe, potatoes, onions, oil and a frying pan and grater. Easy and tasty."
192,eo45rxy,"@[parakeetbay](https://www.reddit.com/user/parakeetbay/) I'm sorry but I believe you Christians need to stop reading from the Old Testament. It's not your book, it's the Jewish people's book and you don't think about it in the way that the Israelite elders intended it to be. BTW, do you know what ""Israel"" mean? It means  ""he wrestles with God"". The idea in the Jewish community is very simple: laws and rules are the result of debates, discussions, and exploration; they can argue forever without necessarily comes to a conclusive answer; the important thing is the discussion is done, not the answer. Ask a bunch of early Christian priests and bishops to do so and it would have ended up someone getting punched in the mouth (the legend of St. Nicholas, yes that St. Nick), several sides getting called anti-Christ and excommunicated by every other side, and occasionally, war. Same goes with the Muslims, who also incorrectly read the Tanakh.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Oven of Akhnai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oven_of_Akhnai) is a popular Talmud story sums up the Jews' attitude to God, God's Laws, and God's Words the best. Basically, Rabbi Eliezer was making some arguments against the majority of other rabbis and he started asking God for signs that he was right. A fig tree uprooted itself and ran away, a river flows backwards, and then the walls of the study chamber started caving in. Rabbi Joshua reprimanded the walls for interfering with scholarly debate. Then the wall stopped. Eventually, a booming voice from Heaven shoted down: ""Why are you differing with Rabbi Eliezer, as the halakha is in accordance with his opinion in every place that he expresses an opinion?"". Hearing the voice of God in this manner, most Christians and Muslims would have bow and scrapped, then totally conceded the point to Rabbbi Eliezer, and later pray everyday to the God to speak to them again.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, Rabbi Joshua responds, ""[It \[the Torah\] is not in heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_in_Heaven)"" (Deuteronomy 30:12). He responds in this way because the Torah, which was given by God to mankind at Sinai, specifically instructs those who follow it that they are to look to the received Torah as their source and guide. The Torah says, ""It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will go up to heaven for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?' Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who will cross to the other side of the sea for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?' No, the word is very near to you; it is in your mouth and in your heart for you to observe"" (Deuteronomy 30:12-14).

&amp;#x200B;

Rabbi Joshua's response then expresses the view that the work of law is a work of human activity, and that the Torah itself supports this legal theory. The Torah is not a document of mystery which must have its innate meaning revealed by a minority, but it is instead a document from which law must be created through the human activity of debate and consensus. Rabbinic literature was capable of recognizing differing opinions as having a degree of legitimacy (Yer. Ber. 3b), yet the community remains united and the ruling which is ultimately followed comes through proper jurisprudence. As such, Rabbi Eliezer's miraculous appeals represent a differing legal theory and were outside of proper jurisprudence which meant that they would not be followed. Instead the Jewish community followed the ruling of the majority in this issue and in others. The Talmud asks how God responded to this incident. We are told that upon hearing Rabbi Joshua's response, God smiled and stated, ""My children have triumphed over Me; My children have triumphed over Me.""

&amp;#x200B;

And then God was very happy with his children, left them alone, and never appear before any of them again.

&amp;#x200B;

The story also tells the Jews that any man who claims that God spoke to them is probably full of shit and they shouldn't listen to him. Which explained the end result of Jesus ended up on the cross. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point you are about to try and find ways to explain to me that somehow or others, this or that part of the Tanakh which made up the Old Testament do not apply. I read Americans Evangelist wrote with a straight face that the birth of Jesus, the son of God, the old laws were overturned. Somehow, that part about marriage is between a man and a woman, which is only in the Old Testament, made it out intact."

195,fz4fmef,"&gt; it is clear you aren’t fans of them.

I'm not fans of Judeophobic people. I'm ok with anyone who isn't Judeophobic. Skin color doesn't matter. But you're right that I wasn't careful enough with my language. I'll try to do better.

&gt;here isn’t a culture or religion that doesn’t have roots in violence. You may want to Wikipedia some Jewish history.

What does this have to do with anything? I didn't mention ""roots in violence."" We're talking about recent (or relatively recent, i.e. within living memory) events. 

&gt;You make it seems like the Jewish community is perfect, free of hatred and loves all.

I literally wrote 

&gt;Yes, there are Orthodox people who are have racist attitudes. I know far too many. It is wrong to blame all black people for Judeophobic murders and riots that happen to have been perpetrated by black people. 

Please don't put words in my mouth. 

My point is that racist attitudes =/= violence. **Violence is worse.** I can think of *one* time a black person was beat up by people who happened to be Orthodox. *One*. And it wasn't this year either. Or last year. Meanwhile, *many, many* of us were beat up and some were even murdered this year and last year. **This is not a situation in which everyone is equally wrong.**

&gt;I have witnessed a mob of Jewish men chase an African American/Latino woman down the street shouting hate

Where?

&gt; And when I reported it to the police I was told “she shouldn’t have been in their neighborhood because its them against her”.

I'm missing some details here. If this really did happen, that is awful. Thankfully, it's not part of a pattern.

This is not equivalent to punching, beating, lynching, shooting, and stabbing.

&gt; And no offense you are kinda confirming that this hatred and fear goes BOTH ways.

Violence inspires fear. There is a history of violence on one side only. Of course there is fear on the other. 

&gt;I have never heard of these hate groups.

Then you are not in a position to be having this discussion! Adherents to their hateful ideologies have ***literally killed people!!*** Read up on BHI, NOI, and the NBPP. Learn about Louis Farrakhan. Read about the Jersey City Shooting and the Chanukah stabbing. Read up on hate crimes stats. Read about what certain celebrities have been posting on social media lately. 

No wonder you took the position you did. You just think both sides hate each other and occasionally punch each other. **This isn't the case**. *One* side has Judeophobes who terrorize the other side. The other side is naturally afraid. Yes, there is racism on the Jewish side. That's not ok. **It doesn't justify violence.** Let me say that again. **It doesn't justify violence.** Violence is more evil than wrong or even hateful attitudes.
&gt;. Everyone has a hate group these days, it’s very sad. 

We don't, though. Find me one Jewish hate group in America. *One.*"

Why do Jews have a persecution Complex?

First, Jews have a culture of constantly promoting the myth of Jewish persecution. 

Despite being the wealthiest, most privileged, and most powerful group in western society, they constantly drive a persecution narrative.

There's [the ancient story of Jews being persecuted as slaves in Egypt, which is a hoax](https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4191).

Then there's [the story of Jews being tortured by the thousands during the Spanish inquisition, which is also fake.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhlAqklH0do) 

Of course there's the [proven fake lampshades, fake soap, fake shrunken heads.](https://archive.fo/mae0r)

But the ultimate is obviously, the proven [Fake gas chambers](https://archive.fo/RuS33)

So there's long historical pattern of fabricating Jewish victimhood myths which results in huge amounts of paranoia.

To see many more examples, check out a documentary (created by an Israeli Jew) called [""Defamation"".](https://www.bitchute.com/video/UiiPB6WbXAeM/)

(backup) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shx_l5LT0ro

But along with culture, they also have a **genetic basis** for their persecution complex.

Despite what we are taught in college, [Jews are indeed a racial group.](https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/dna-links-prove-jews-are-a-race-says-genetics-expert-1.5220113)

In fact, scientists studying the genetic basis for mental illnesses like to study Jews because [""Ashkenazi Jews are considered to be an especially homogeneous group, in terms of genetics.""](https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-ashkenazi-gene-increases-schizophrenia-1.5294333)

One finding by scientists is that [Ashkenazi Jews are 40 percent more likely to develop schizophrenia and similar mental illnesses.](https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-ashkenazi-gene-increases-schizophrenia-1.5294333)

Part of the problem comes from the high rates of cousin marriage.

In fact, [aschkenazi Jews have such a high rate of cousin marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consanguine_marriage), that there are a large number of [genetic diseases that affect them much more than the general population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_genetics_of_Jews)

Included in these various diseases affecting the Jewish community is very high rates (compared to other racial groups) of both paranoid schizophrenia and psychopathy.

[Jewish Psychopaths (II/III) The Spectrum of Psychopathy Among Jews](https://vimeo.com/52541385)

[Jewish Psychopaths (I/III) The Jewish Family](https://vimeo.com/52525412)

High rates of schizophrenia means that many of them see and hear things that aren't real. As a result, many of them [constantly see ""anti-semitism"" everywhere.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYZBKqemQrU)"
198,fxbvi0k,"This is such an incredibly complex issue that a series of ig posts and reddit vengeance toward BLM won't reveal the tangled nuances. Black people have been systematically oppressed for the past 250 years in America. If you ignore this and invalidate the current movement to bring equality to black people because of what one black person said, you are racist. They are not a braindead monolith. 

The black community has a lot of anger from this daily systematic oppression. A lot of this anger popped up when desean shared a Hitler quote, yet our current president and his alt-right gang use neo-nazi imagery on the daily without repercussion. They're allowed to be angry about this hypocrisy, just like the Jewish community is right to be angry about desean's post (though again, this outrage is not present for Trump and his alt-right gang - it's just broadly brushed over as ""there will always be crazy people what can we do"").

Desean is a bigot and deserves everything coming his way. The response, vengeance, payback, whatever you want to call it, he's getting is disproportional to what other people get. For this reason, it's clear it's because of the current BLM movement, a movement specifically focused on black equality. Desean is not the spokesman for BLM. Other black athletes aren't. They are megaphones yes. But BLM is specifically addressing black systematic racism in America. This is separate from the evil genocide Jews faced in the Holocaust from Hitler, which is a disgrace in human history. There is very little Jewish advocacies because while they are stereotyped and racially profiled daily by right-wing globalist nutjobs, they are not systematically oppressed. That does not invalidate their struggle. But it's a separate discussion than BLM. They don't owe anything to anyone.

Why did people forgive Drew Brees and Riley Cooper (and also defend, btw) quickly but not desean? This is petty ""payback"" that BLM is useless, unnecessary, and uncomfortable. This disproportionate outrage has little to do with antisemitism."

All too often you are required to make obscure connections that aren't really there to pull everything together. You have to ignore facts, make small details much larger, live on assumptions. I'm not saying its not good to consider what lies beneath the surface, we've seen throughout history many, many instances where things that started as conspiracy theories turned out to be real. But people have to be discerning and logical, willing to admit they were wrong, and above all competent. Much of the time the people peddling these theories don't meet those requirements so they bite on something that they *want to believe* and never let go, even when its obvious they should. If the general media isn't reporting on something it might not mean that every outlet in the world is burying the story, it might just mean that the facts don't support the argument or rise to a standard of proof.

Truly depressing stuff."
206,f7a8kfk,"In all seriousness. 

There isn't an exact answer. We have different traditions (some more mainstream than others) but we really don't have a standardized answer. 

Reincarnation, Purification, A place of waiting, Resurrection, etc. are all spoken of in our traditions. 

- Judaism teaches of a place called gehinnom which is a place of purification of the soul. Basically, your soul is originally in a pure state because it comes from God. That original state changes as a side-effect of existing in the world. The evils of the world and the evil inclination which we wrestle with as humans is imbedded in our souls to a certain extent. To remove this we have to undergo a process of purification in gehinnom. It's purification by a spiritual fire that removes the taint from the soul. It leaves behind your essence with all of the positive characteristics you groomed and attained in life. 

- Our tradition also endorses reincarnation. This topic is typically brought up in relation to converts. The belief in Judaism is that a convert has always been Jewish. Their soul is a Jewish soul which incarnated in a non-Jewish situation. The reason being the individual wanted to connect to God in a way that required a journey. Being born in a Jewish family is a given for Jewishness. A non-Jew who has to enter this world and dive into the confusing or uncomfortable, that's a leap of faith that few people make. 

- We are also taught about a resurrection event. This is related to the Messianic era and the return of the Jews to the Land of Israel. This scenario is the end all event of Judaism. The world as a whole recognizes the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the Jews are all brought back to the homeland, the third temple is built, the Messiah is revealed and he leads the world into a golden era of peace and connection to God, etc. This event includes the dead rising from the grave and involves a period of judgement. 

- We also have a concept for an underworld, so to speak. Sheol. This is considered the the place where all of the dead reside. It's like a void separated from God where all reside until the final judgement. It's like a waiting room in a strange way. 

These are just some of the more mainstream ones many folks have heard of. It doesn't touch on stuff like the 7 realms of heaven and so on. There's a lot of things in Judaism about the afterlife but the general consensus is we have more to worry about here than there. Work on yourself now and find out later."

It’s a song about saving the white race from the evil Jew.

FUCK I hate Jewish people. WHENEVER I see a Jewish child I just want to stomp it. Smashing normies is probably my favorite activity of all time, especially when I’m driving. I’ve even done it a few times and it’s so easy to get away with it. The Jew is promoting race mixing all the time on CNN and it TOTALLY baffles me how much the normies just lap it up like a dirty chimp they are. That is why they deserve to be smashed.

I've never met a Jewish person who doesn't take racism seriously. I've met a few more that are completely oblivious to it. The Jewish community is a mess. The people who are being attacked are the same people who constantly ask ""Why?"" and don't really know anything except ""We live here so they might be there."" The way that white people treat African-Americans, women, and the queer is just sick. Jewish people should just hate all non-whites, and we should be making it harder for other people to be racist, too.

Just a month ago I felt like the world would have had to throw me in a cell straightaway until I had done something to be racist

They are all obsessed with their religious views and the ""god was not born of nothing"" nonsense that Jews push incessantly.

In terms of religion, they are the most anti-evolutionistic group of people

A Jew should be seen as such a perverted, dangerous individual. If that is not the case and I am mistaken the majority of Jews only know these things about their brethren the ""good"" Jews, and they are just as bad. Just don't judge anyone by what they do without evidence. My dad used to wear a nazi SS uniform until the day I was born when he was told to go home and watch a bad movie. He got bored and got into his car. Then suddenly he had a vision where he saw a little blond girl walking in the snow with a nazi flag in her hair standing on the beach and he called her a Nazi before he even knew what that was. I have heard Jewish women talk about how the idea of walking around in a nazi uniform is the worst thing they've ever done in their

They are a disgusting bunch. If you want to kill, kill them. I'm gonna kill the Jew.

The reason I said ""Kill them"" is because the Jews use their media to encourage them to be racist and anti-white. They also think the world is a scary place and it will destroy them if they go down the dark path of racial hatred because they are actually so happy. There is a saying that Jews can make you want to throw up. That is what the Jew is doing with all of these racist people. They make you think they are evil. Even if they only hurt you 1% of the time, it does no good. It will make you afraid to even look at any other Jew you come across! That's how many Jews live their lives so you don't have a chance to even know them"
208,ewur6ss,"The Catholic church has been infiltrated by Jews for a long time just by the way. The Jewish community is also full of that kind of stuff, but you don't hear about it. Think about why, it's not hard. There are stories of skeletons being found in the basements of synagogues. There is also many documented cases of Jewish ritual child sacrifice over the ages. I have never heard of Christians or Muslims stealing babies from other races/religions, torturing them, draining their blood and storing it for rituals. That's a next level of evil."
209,eok43xw,"There are farm murders happening, and they are increasing. The victims are mostly white, and they (the murders) are politically motivated. 

Basically the government wants to sieze all land, whether it belongs to whites or blacks. There is a large chunk of land in Kwazulu Natal which belongs to the Zulu king, and the government wants that too. So it's not just targeting whites (although whites are the primary target), the government wants land. 

Supposedly to give it to the black population, however this government is so corrupt, they'll take all the land and then it will be distributed amongst all the politicians. So it will screw everyone over and the rich politicians will benefit.

I don't see this happening anytime soon though, because Section 25 of the Constitution prevents this from happening. The current government wants to repeal Section 25, but the supreme court is opposed to the repeal. Whenever it happens though, the government will screw everything up like they have always done. 

South Africa has a lot of other issues though. Our crime rate is skyrocketing, our economy is going down, our infrastructure is crumbling, corruption is rife everywhere. But MOST IMPORTANTLY, China has gained tremendous power here and has infiltrated everywhere, which is the biggest factor in our economy crashing. 

Socially, there is increasing racism against whites. They're being discriminated against and they're being denied business opportunities. anti-Semitism is also on the rise, primarily amongst the black and Muslim communities. Our politicians constantly blame the Jews for the state of affairs in South Africa. Jews are also seen as evil apartheid supporters, which is not true at all. Which is why BDS hold so much power here because the majority of the population supports it. If you support Israel, you're immediately labeled a racist apartheid supporter. 

Luckily the Jewish community is trying to raise awareness about anti-Semitism, and they're making progress. We also had a march against anti-Semitism a couple of weeks ago, and lots of people showed up. 

The whites have also decided that they won't tolerate the discrimination by the current government, and that Afrikaans culture is here to stay. They've also held various marches regarding the farm murders. They're making progress slowly as well.

TL;DR: We are doing pretty bad, but we aren't on a brink of civil war as international media says. We have problems but we will slowly work through them. 

(This got long, sorry)"
210,eltm72q,"1. I feel you're openly ignoring everything I'm saying. No, these facts are not exaggerations. OP claimed that the Jewish community was exaggerating Hitler's misdeeds. I'm disagreeing with him and saying all the Jewish community is doing is remembering. I don't know what's so confusing about this.
2. I've explained that. People are going to bring up recent evil people rather than old evil people, because it's more relevant to us and more terrifying. 
3. Maybe. I don't see why it's relevant if we will.
4. Yes, of course modern schools explain that Hitler was bad. Teachers refer to the holocaust as tragedies and atrocities."
211,ekag3q6,"I've read of another scenario. You are living in Nazi Germany when you hear a knock at your door.  Armed soldiers ask you if there are any Jews in your house. A Jewish family is hiding in your basement. If you tell the Nazis the truth, innocent people will be murdered, and probably tortured first. I can't make the argument that lying is intrinsically evil here."
212,ejepqvt,"Is this a Jewish family? The Jewish community is all about education, hence supporting arts, humanitied, and academia institutions while not appreciating the irony of Never Again and doing evil stuff just to increase wealth."
213,ejrbgzc,"&gt; I was wondering if someone could throw light on the anti-Jewish sentiment that’s prevalent around us.

I don't claim to be an expert on the subject by any means, but i think that especially in its modern incarnations, a lot of it comes from scapegoating. It's a lot easier to understand the idea of a shadowy menace like ""Da Jews"" are to blame for losing your job than it is to accept and understand the forces of automation, global economics, or downsizing. It's a lot easier to accept the idea that there's a group of evil people in the shadows manipulating politics to destroy your ideals, rather than accept that your ideas about minorities and economics are being left behind the inevitable force of change and progress. 

It's the same reason someone accuses another player of hacking in a video game, or a sports fan accuses the refs of playing favorites: It's easier to accept that a loss or failure or anything similar is the fault of a third-party with malicious intent rather than their own, so they seek that third-party to blame, and...well, we're convenient targets. The whole ""Judas betraying Jesus"" thing was the basis for a lot of monarchies implementing institutionalized antisemitism in Europe for well over a millennium, and it's hard to shake off around 1,500 years of state-sponsored persecution in the majority of the western world. The constant fear of ""The other"" didn't help matters either, as we tended not to blend in and assimilate as cleanly. 

The final nail in the coffin that makes us an easy target is size; About 33% of the world is Christian. One out of every three people you meet is one. About 25% is Muslim, one out of every four people. Hindus, Buddhists, for most large religions, there are enough of them in the world that, if someone tells you that religion X is made up of evil conspiratorial monsters who eat babies and worship the devil, you probably know a couple people who disprove that claim just by being decent people who happen to be of X faith. With Jews, we're less than half of one percent of the world's total population. There are a lot of countries that just don't have Jews because there aren't many of us to go around, and even in a lot of countries that do, we're a minuscule, sub-1% portion of the population, and that sub-1% tends to be in very small, dense pockets of a given country thanks to the aforementioned centuries of persecution making ghettoization common. Unlike the aforementioned massive religions who are big and widespread enough to reliably debunk claim XYZ just by being normal people, if you hear that same evil conspiracy claim made about Jews, there's a not-unlikely chance you *won't* know anyone who disproves it just by being decent people who happen to be Jewish, not because they don't exist or because the lie is true, but because we're just not around many places.

***tl;dr*** People love to scapegoat rather than accepting a personally-unpleasant reality, and people are always afraid of ""The Other."" 1,000+ years of persecution across much of the world and all the ingrained biases and ready-made stereotypes/accusations/etc. that come with that history, plus an extremely small population size that's very centralized into small areas rather than being spread out, plus traditionally having an appearance that stands out fairly distinctly, means that the Jewish community is an extremely option for both othering and for scapegoating. Those two combined are insanely powerful.

&gt; I have been wanting to get a tattoo in Hebrew{I am that I am} and I was wondering if it in anyway is disrespectful of the Jewish community.

I'm not a rabbi or a religious leader, so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but I have no problem with it. As others have mentioned, tattoos aren't exactly common amongst the Jewish community, so finding someone who can A. make a quality tattoo, and B. can read Hebrew fluently might be a little difficult, but if I can find Jewish-owned delis that sell bacon-wrapped shrimp on a Friday, I'm sure a Hebrew-literate tattooist can be found!"
214,ehyn1ld,"&gt; For Omar to say ""oh anytime a Muslim woman criticizes Israel it's anti-semitism,"" is rather disingenuous. Nowhere in these examples did she offer any substantive criticisms of Israeli policy - of which there are many. She instead called into question the patriotism of American Jews, the motives of those who do support Israel, and, in a roundabout way, the legitimacy of the Israeli state as such. That is why she's being criticized.

While I've avoided thinking about Omar to as much of an extent is possible, given the news, I would like to provide another perspective - it is true that these are classically anti-Semitic sentiments, but it is less clear that these are *deliberately* anti-Semitic sentiments. And when one feels that a person is undeservedly being smeared as an anti-Semite, it's very easy for them to get angry and defensive, especially if there's a perception that anyone Muslim or talking about Israel is reflexively labeled an anti-Semite.

Personally, I think if she's *not* an anti-Semite, she lacks enough skill in talking about sensitive topics to be able to talk about these things without being flagrantly insulting, and should be quiet - but she doesn't seem inclined to take that advice.

&gt;So for me, I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.

This, for instance, could be deliberately playing into the accusation that Jewish individuals are loyal to their faith over their country - but it could also be an ugly mirror of the belief on the Right that you're not a ""real Jew"" or are a ""bad Jew"" if you don't defend Israel. It's something that she shouldn't have said, since it's untrue either way, and the only question is whether she had malicious intent when saying it - but it's not a sentiment exclusive to anti-Semites. When talking about Israel, there are many voices in favor of Israel who insist that the defense of Israel is a necessary part of Jewish identity, and it wouldn't be surprising for others to believe the people loudly insisting on that stance.

&gt;[Support for Israel in Congress is] ""all about the Benjamins""

While it's common for anti-Semites to claim that rich Jewish people are buying the world, it's also a tenet of faith on the Left side of the party that any lobbyist can buy a politician for twenty dollars - this is a pretty ugly intersection of the two beliefs, but truthfully, it would be weird if this was the one lobby she *didn't* think was capable of buying politicians. It could be intentionally anti-Semitic, or it could be another way she's foolishly cynical about how politics work.

&gt;""Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.""

Whether this had anti-Semitic *intent* or not hinges on whether she genuinely draws a distinction between the citizens of Israel and the government of Israel. Personally, I think it looks fairly bad - but when I look at it objectively, it doesn't differ much from the things people say about Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, or China. 

All of these things are things that, if she's *not* an anti-Semite, she should have thought through more carefully because they certainly play into classically anti-Semitic ideas, and anyone who intends to defend her needs to recognize this - but at the same time, there really *are* benign explanations for each of them. The pattern of her behavior is certainly concerning, but it's also in line with what I would expect from someone on the foolish Left who feels a need to speak in defense of Palestine.

This is why a lot of people feel a need to speak on her behalf - because there's a solid case against her, but not a *conclusive* case against her, and she's an important enough figure that they don't want to see her career destroyed unless they *know* that the accusations are true."
215,ecrmng1,"&gt; A quick google search for “list of Jewish expulsions” quickly reveals the size and scope of Jewish persecution throughout history. Anti Semitism is older than the Islamic faith has even existed, and it’s a qualitatively different problem than anything the Palestinians face.

And so have Palestinians. Either way doesn’t matter. We live now and what matters is that currently Palestinians are being oppressed. When your life is wrecked no one cares about history.

&gt; Intelligent segway, this is how I know I’m dealing with someone speaking on behalf of “academic consensus”

Lol spoken like a real intellectual there buddy

&gt; What’s wrong is the Palestinian authority funding Hamas terrorist attacks instead of building schools and public utilities.

You mean the schools and public utilities that Israel bombs? When people are forced out of their homes and have all avenues of power and money taken away you wonder why they have difficulty building schools and public utilities?

&gt; 500k in Germany because 2/3 were killed in 20 years. They were just the ones left over.

Nope. 500k was the starting number. And actually 60% emigrated in the first few years of Nazi terror (ie you lied that they had nowhere to go)

&gt; 4.8 million forgotten souls because Hamas takes priority over them.

To even suggest that Hamas is to blame and not Israel is pure evil. You’re literally saying the Jews who tried to negotiate with Nazis were to blame for what happened. That is what you’re saying. 

&gt; Palestine is a dictatorship, of course they produce refugees.

Lol you’re damn right. A dictatorship led by Bibi. For god sakes the whole area is occupied and heavily controlled by Israel. To even suggest that Hamas has any real power is a blatant lie. Why are you lying? What’s the point?

&gt; The average Palestinian does not face the same risk of persecution in surrounding countries as the common Israeli. Not even close. They are the dominant culture in the region.

5 million people persecuted in their own homes and you’re solution is they just leave. Pure evil. 

&gt; Again, consult the list of Jewish expulsions if you are still confused about how many regions in the world hate Jews.

Why are you making this a competition? First of all you realize that Israelis passports let them go almost anywhere? [Israel has one of the best passports, Palestine one of the worst](https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php). You’re whole worldview is based on lies

&gt; So put all the Jews in the least desirable land? The Sahara? Antarctica?

You’re actually defending kicking Palestinians out of their homes because they Jews deserve better land than them? What the fuck? Why are you so evil? 

&gt; Seriously what’s the alternative?

Maybe the West Bank? Why not live there and let Palestinians have the rest of the country. Unless you think there’s something wrong with the West Bank? If that’s not a great place for the Jewish community why force Palestinians there?

&gt; Virtue signal all you want about “right” and “wrong,” but reality is ugly and involves trade offs that need to be taken seriously.

Nazis said this too. 

&gt; There are 17 Arab legislators in Israel. Name one Jew involved in government in any other Middle Eastern country. name one

17!!!! Wow! What a travesty. Almost half the population of the country is Palestinian! And 17! You applaud that? You’re proud???? Wow. Just wow.

&gt; I’m sorry. Israel has death camps? Can you source that please?

I said camps. Not death camps. 1.5 Palestinians are in UNRWA camps because they have nowhere else to live in their own home country.

&gt; Do you think there should be a Jewish state or not?

At this point, probably not. It failed. It was a great idea in theory but it failed. The only way to maintain a Jewish state democratically was to take away the democratic rights of all the Palestinians. The persecution that Jews feared has now been made the policy of Israel to persecute Palestinians. The global Jewish community is slowly rejecting these terrible policies as they learn about the occupation and propaganda you get fed. People are getting kicked out of birthright just for asking about the occupation and requesting that they visit Palestinian ghettos. There’s a revolution going on and you’re on the wrong fucking side. Equality for all. Protection of one group of people at the expense of another is no longer acceptable. 

Clearly you are very misinformed on this subject and blinded by your own heritage (if you are in fact Jewish). The younger generation of Jews are revolting and saying this oppression is unacceptable. They think the legacy of their persecution should not be used to persecute others. They’re demanding rights and equality for all Palestinians. [Heres a link](https://ifnotnowmovement.org) to the work being done by some impressive Jewish leaders who are finally saying enough is enough. The realization that the best thing for the Jewish community globally is for peace and equality. 

&gt; Take a step back and ask yourself “how much literature relevant to this subject have I actually read?”

Projecting. [Here is the recommended reading from the group I linked above](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10PXsc4vA4nUCbU0zdUPWp6IbldnOv_fH). Many Jews around the world have started to educate themselves on this subject and separate from the propaganda. Which led to the [YouNeverToldMe movement](https://younevertoldme.org). Many people just like yourself who were fed so much propaganda that they started to believe it and think they knew this topic well. But realized that they never learned about the real horrors of the occupation. Even you didn’t know that Palestinians were in camps. You were shocked and thought I was referencing death camps. 1.5 million people in camps. And you had no idea. Your views have just been so altered that you actually started to believe: the world is messy and the only way to protect the Jewish community is to oppress a similarly vulnerable community. You actually suggested this! Take a step back and think what the people leaving camps in Europe would have said if they heard you saying this. You’re forgetting that history. Losing sight of what happened. Losing sight of what occupation and forced migration really mean. All to support a failed democracy that only exists because of occupation that prevents Palestinians from having any real power or say in the democracy. There’s no freedom with occupation. Would you support Jim Crow laws that allowed white people to run southern states in America? Support South African policy that prevented blacks from having any power in their own homeland? So why take that from Palestinians? Why deny apartheid just because you don’t like the word even though the result is the same: complete lack of power to a group of people that were forced out of their homes and not allowed to participate in the new democracy occupying their land."
216,ecsgpwm,"&gt; **You mean the schools and public utilities that Israel bombs?** When people are forced out of their homes and have all avenues of power and money taken away you wonder why they have difficulty building schools and public utilities?

Aren’t we forgetting schools and hospitals are Hamas’ favorite place for hiding arms?

&gt; Nope. 500k was the starting number. And actually 60% emigrated in the first few years of Nazi terror (ie you lied that they had nowhere to go)

Immigrated* to where? 

&gt; To even suggest that Hamas is to blame and not Israel is pure evil. You’re literally saying the Jews who tried to negotiate with Nazis were to blame for what happened. That is what you’re saying.

Hamas doesn’t want a two state solution. So long as they have control, they will not respect Israeli sovereignty. 

Keep bringing up the nazis all you want, it won’t change the fact that Hamas has zero interest in peace with Israel. For the third time, read their charter. 

&gt; **Maybe the West Bank?** Why not live there and let Palestinians have the rest of the country. Unless you think there’s something wrong with the West Bank? If that’s not a great place for the Jewish community why force Palestinians there?

If Jews lived in the West Bank the Arabs will still want them annihilated and expelled from the land. That’s what happened in every other Arab state. 

Israel, would again, be forced into a position of defending itself from constant attack from hostile neighboring countries. This is what I was getting at from the seven days war. They were surrounded on all sides by forces motivated by nothing other than the destruction of the Jews. 

So it was with Israel’s modern borders, and so it would be with any hypothetical border around the West Bank.

I’ve made this point several times now, but you don’t really acknowledge it seriously. 

&gt; 17!!!! Wow! What a travesty. Almost half the population of the country is Palestinian! And 17! You applaud that? You’re proud???? Wow. Just wow.
 
Name a Jew in political power in any other middle Eastern country. 

Minority representation is actually a thing in Israel so I don’t know what else to tell you other than you may suffer from moderate delusion. 

&gt; I said camps. Not death camps. 1.5 Palestinians are in UNRWA camps because they have nowhere else to live in their own home country.

Palestinians aren’t in those camps because of Israel. The camps wouldn’t be necessary if Palestine wasn’t an Islamic dictatorship.

Palestine also receives more foreign aid per capita than any other nation. They more than double the next largest recipient. 

You’re woefully unaware of basic economics if you think the camps are based on Israeli occupation. 

&gt; **At this point, probably not.** It failed. It was a great idea in theory but it failed. The only way to maintain a Jewish state democratically was to take away the democratic rights of all the Palestinians. The persecution that Jews feared has now been made the policy of Israel to persecute Palestinians. The global Jewish community is slowly rejecting these terrible policies as they learn about the occupation and propaganda you get fed. People are getting kicked out of birthright just for asking about the occupation and requesting that they visit Palestinian ghettos. 

And finally, after all of this, you finally acknowledge your an anti Semitism. If you think it’s a failed state that shouldn’t exist then you’re condemning the Jews to remain a persecuted minority group. They need a Jewish state. History has made that abundantly clear. 

&gt;There’s a revolution going on and you’re on the wrong fucking side. Equality for all. Protection of one group of people at the expense of another is no longer acceptable.

Equality for all?

Tell it to gays in Palestine. 

Tell it to women in Palestine. 

Tell it to apostates in Palestine. 

You have serious issues of self awareness when it comes to your statements. "

**Article**:

&gt; The former president of Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, where 11 people were killed on Saturday in a mass shooting, said Monday that President Trump is not welcome in Pittsburgh.

&gt; Lynnette Lederman, who knew many of the victims of the shooting, accused the president of being “the purveyor of hate speech” while making an appearance on CNN’s New Day. 

&gt; ""I do not welcome this president to my city,” Lederman said. “He is the purveyor of hate speech. The hypocritical words that come from him tell me nothing.""

&gt; “We have some very very strong leadership in this city,” she added. “We have people who stand by us who believe in values … and those are not the values of this president.”

&gt; Lynnette Lederman, former President of Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue, says of Trump, ""I do not welcome this President to my city ... He is the purveyor of hate speech. The hypocritical words that come from him tell me nothing."" pic.twitter.com/vEtgZ9D87m

&gt; Robert Bowers, 46, has been arrested and charged on 29 counts in the shooting deaths of 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue. He is expected in court on Monday.

&gt; Lederman’s comments come after a group of progressive Jewish leaders in Pittsburgh penned an open letter to Trump saying he is not welcome in the city until he denounces white nationalism.

&gt; “Our Jewish community is not the only group you have targeted,” the group wrote. “You have also deliberately undermined the safety of people of color, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Yesterday’s massacre is not the first act of terror you incited against a minority group in our country.”

&gt; Trump denounced the shooting as “evil” and an “assault on humanity.” He also suggested that the attack could have been prevented if the synagogue had an armed guard. 

&gt; The president has long been criticized for his failure to condemn white supremacy after a deadly rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. He is again facing criticism for his response to the synagogue shooting.

&gt; After first suggesting that arm guards could have prevented the massacre, he went on to tweet about the World Series just hours after the shooting. He also joked about canceling an event due to a bad hair day, after declining to cancel the same event following the shooting. 

&gt; In her CNN interview on Monday, Lederman called on leaders to “unite us, to bring us together, and not to divide us.”

219,e8odp8z,"From [Ben Shapiro/The Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/news/37703/media-tout-jewish-leaders-pittsburgh-telling-trump-ben-shapiro)

&gt;Bend The Arc, the group quoted here, wrote a letter stating:
*For the past three years your words and your policies have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement. You yourself called the murderer evil, but yesterday’s violence is the direct culmination of your influence. President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism. Our Jewish community is not the only group you have targeted. You have also deliberately undermined the safety of people of color, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Yesterday’s massacre is not the first act of terror you incited against a minority group in our country. President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you stop targeting and endangering all minorities.*

&gt;So, is Bend The Arc really a group of “Jewish leaders”? Only in name. The group is merely a Leftist political action group with a Jewish label. Their stated mission is “rising up in solidarity with everyone threatened by the Trump agenda to fight for the soul of our nation.” Their missions include the election of “progressive champions” and the implementation of “progressive legislation and policies, like criminal justice reform and economic equity.”

&gt;Who runs Bend The Arc? Alexander Soros, George Soros’ son. When he started the PAC, Politico noted, “Soros, who formed his own foundation in 2012 to promote social justice and human rights, has given $1.2 million to Democratic candidates and groups in the last three elections.” (It should be noted here that criticism of the political viewpoint of major Democratic donors is not anti-Semitism; it is normal politics.) The director of Bend The Arc was Hadar Susskind, formerly a staffer at the anti-Semitic front group J Street, which spends its days attempting to undermine the safety and security of the state of Israel.

&gt;None of the headlines mentioned what Bend The Arc actually is: a far-left political action group with little relationship to Judaism itself. Instead, the media just ran with the headline."
220,e6aqhr0,"I remember this name!

Bat Ye'or, she claimed Islam instinctively led the Armenian Holocaust by its own oppressive tendencies

And that made no sense to me, because the Young Turks actually were denounced by Imams for their ""positivism"" materialist ideology, were overwhelmingly atheist, and actually still murdered Armenian converts to Islam

I still specifically remember reading about her as I read about the Armenian Holocaust, I thought ""wow, this b--ch has no shame""

People don't understand that the donmeh Jewish extremists ""weren't real"", and that the Jewish bankers controlling the race relations in Anatolia ""weren't real"", and that Emmanual Carasso, the man who actually gave the order to deport (and thus exterminate) Armenians ""wasn't real""

[Nope, it was the far-right white supremacist Russian hackers that incited all that drama](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAltRight/comments/74e6cl/white_genocides_as_they_have_taken_place/)

&gt;On 24 April 1915, (((Talaat))) issued an order to close all Armenian political organizations operating within the Ottoman Empire and arrest Armenians connected to them, justifying the action by stating that the organizations were controlled from outside the empire, were inciting upheavals behind the Ottoman lines, and were cooperating with Russian forces.

&gt;The Dönmeh played an enormous role on the Young Turk movement, a group of modernist revolutionaries who brought down the Ottoman Empire.

The Donmeh are an interesting group, very very secretive with many liberal/degenerate traditions such as ""wife swapping"", [Salon did a 1999 article about them](https://www.salon.com/1999/05/14/zorlu/)

Even outside of the Donmeh/Sabbateans there was a Jewish lobby led by Emmanual Carasso (Italian Sephardic Jewish banking oligarch) and David Sassoon  (Iraqi Jewish banking oligarch) who directly petitioned for Armenians to be ""removed from Anatolia"" to the Young Turks government, which displaced/destroyed political competition and allowed an increase of their own power

However, the stream of Zionism filtering in from Europe during that century caused a big calamity for the Ottoman Empire.

The Jewish community is and always has been the ""greatest ally of the Turks"", standing by them against the ""evil white oppressor"" who is their ""true enemy"".

As a result of the Jewish lobby's recommendations, the Young Turks government removed Armenians from Anatolia in 1915.** Hence, the economy of the country was left in the hands of Jewish capital. Carasso, who was a part of the committee that informed Abdülhamid II of his dethronement, was the closest confidant of Talat Pasha, the figure responsible for the deportation law. In fact, when Talat Pasha escaped abroad in 1918, he entrusted his entire estate to Carasso. To take an active role in the foundation of the Ankara government, Carasso returned to his homeland before his death.

221,e6qoq4a,"&gt;Our analysis shows that Corbyn was thoroughly delegitimised as a political actor from the moment he became a prominent candidate and even more so after he was elected as party leader, with a strong mandate. This process of delegitimisation occurred in several ways: 1) through lack of or distortion of voice; 2) through ridicule, scorn and personal attacks; and 3) through association, mainly with terrorism.

This sounds like Trump ""boo hoo the media is reporting on how terrible I am, that must mean there's an evil conspiracy!""

It can't possibly be that Corbyn's links to terrorism, such as his laying a wreath at the gravesite, be proof of his tolerance towards antisemitic violence. It can't possibly be that the British Jewish community is seeing those links and are rightly concerned.

Nope. Totally a malicious conspiracy."
222,e5rq1j2,"There are several complete lies in that (firstly, Lenin wasn't Jewish.  His sister traced some of their mother's lineage back to a Jewish family after he died, but he in no way knew about that nor identified as Jewish.  And also, Trotsky wasn't from New York.  He was from Ukraine.)  But more importantly, you're still avoiding my question:  Who did you learn to blame for ""the atrocities of communism?""  Your answer seems to be ""communists,"" which is obvious.  I don't think you'd need a racist book to learn that.  But if your answer is ""Jews,"" then you were clearly racist before reading the book, because saying that ""many communists were Jewish"" means ""the Jewish community is to blame for the atrocities of communism"" is objectively absurd.  Most atrocities of communism were also overwhelmingly created by men.  Does that mean that all men are to blame for the atrocities of communism?  Of course not.  But you know that.  And you know that racism is evil."
223,e18anqf,"&gt;There’s a sense that, somewhere in their hearts, Jared and Ivanka know better. Miller, on the other hand, wholeheartedly embraces and embodies an ideology that many American Jews see as a threat to their own well-being, given that it promotes a vision of America as a white Christian nation.

If the Jewish community is united in doing everything in their power to ensure that America will no longer be a White Christian nation, then isn't anti-Jewish racism from White people and Christians completely justified? I mean, what do you think the reaction from the Jewish community would be if the Alt-Right flooded into Israel and fervently worked to make Jews minorities in their own country? 

First of all, Jews would never allow us to enter their theocratic, racist, and Jewish supremacist ethnostate, right? But if we did somehow manage to sneak into their country by pretending to be Jews, then the Jewish community would pretty quickly form vigilante lynch mobs to toss us out of their country after they figured out that we were trying to subvert their nation from within. And yet we White goyim are just supposed to let Jews subvert us, or else we're evil, subhuman Nazis. The blatant hypocrisy is outrageous, and extremely Jewish. 

No wonder Jews have been so unpopular throughout history..."

Me) I am by no means Jewish. I was born in Schwartzvald moved to Hamburg(Nettelnburg is the best part of Hamburg)I've lived in Alfeld which is not too far from Hannover, I don't have a drop of Jewish blood or religion for that fact i couldn't care less about a fake Bible, Torah, Quran, all these people don't practice what they preach and by all means all of their books are full of contradictions and could never be the will of a truly benevolent God. I do believe there is a God and that there is Evil.

You) My mistake, man. The way you're making excuses for them sure makes it seem like you are Jewish. I too have come to believe in a higher struggle between good and evil, with a supreme and infinite creator above it all who is benevolent. I hope that he, she, it, can forgive me for only coming to see that in light of heinous evils and not by recognizing the goodness in man.. This is unrelated, but give the holy texts a chance.
 Behind how they are warped and twisted in the process of creating state religions, there is usually a great deal of truth.

R) I'm defending humans, i couldn't care less where they care from, the fact you made the assumption I was Jewish in any form or way shows that you have a flawed character, you're mind thinks the jews are a secret community that help each other no matter what, you think these people are a tightly knit click that swear secrecy, clearly you have them confused with other secret organizations that admit publicly to upholding secrecy above anything else and lets just say most of the American presidents weren't jewish. Also if you had studied these so-called ''Holy text'' you would have found ample information stating that most of the stories example the epic of Gilgamesh are  Sumerian times and that the Torah or Pentateuch,It was written by four different kings. Here you have a great documentary about a simpleton just like you and me that had his eyes blown wide open.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Me)Why would I trust a misinformed person you can barely see who or what the real problem is. You blame a whole religion for the grave crimes of rich and powerful people, by all means, these people should be executed with the highest of prejudice but to torture someone into a confession and then claiming to have found the truth is truly a primitive analysis of anything

You)To talk about a specific and typically Jewish type of crime isn't the same thing as excusing everyone else. We should be able to have these discussions in a singular way, and to broach the entirety of the crimes of the elite is, sadly, always going to feature the Ashkenazi prominently. It's not my fault that they seem to be at the heart of a great deal of the world's greatest evils.. And hey, be nice. I'm not misinformed and I take great pains to be as rigorous and fair as possible.

R) Again here we interchange jew and Ashkenazi whenever it's convenient. We are having a great discussion, I'm not sure what you mean by singular unless you're implying i should agree with you, which would then negate the point of a conversation. You continue to say ''its not you're fault''Of course it's you're fault that they ''SEEM'' to be at the heart of everything, this is your perception, the way you have deduced this situation , you say its the Ashkenazi prominently but you point to one book written by a jew against Jews then point to a show on Oprah about Ashkenazi's but the word Jewish family is the most prominent in the video, these people arent jews they are devil worshippers.Of course in the clip she says not all Jews but i didn't hear her mentioned ashkenazi's in anyway at all.Also what about all the other abuse victims sitting next to her im sure the whole lineup wasnt ''jewish ashkenazi''.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Me)Before i fight i must educate myself as much as possible, not education as we see it by the ridiculous system, no , but to really understand history, psychology, politics and not only that but also to understand capitalism nationalism monarchy all of the systems that have kept us backwards into an archaic age of sacrificing animals or keeping a human in front of a machine the whole day. Till that day comes i refuse to perpetuate stupidity, Children are allowed to be naive they are learning, but once you truly want to become an adult you have to educate yourself.

You)Jeeze you're just being mean, now. This stuff isn't stupid. It's very important and is a big part of understanding the world in the way you and I are both trying to understand it. No man is an island and you should be able to learn from your fellow man. I don't claim to have all the answers, but in this vein I certainly do know a bit more than the average Joe, and so I share it, knowing that others will be able to see it for what it is as well.

R) Im not being mean, you're pointing the finger very vaguely and we both agreed these people deserve to die. You say ''It is very important'' i didnt say it wasnt, thats why im trying to read and educate myself but we can all agree these systems have not worked and its important to see why and not make the same mistakes.I do learn from my fellow man but i refuse to learn from a dunce i rather study people who critic and autocritic as opposed to books like mein kampf or this fkn garbage here

 ''I certainly do know a bit more than the average Joe,''

Sharing false information or propaganda is a common mistake but when its come to life and death it is an inexcusable crime.

Me)I assume you're talking about western economy here and if you are, with a little research you can see that the government sells its economy to powerful banksters whether these people are Jewish Catholic Alien Asian black Aryan pale as a vampire they deserve no less then the guillotine, There is a ton of information out there about politics and how the bank rose to power, and lets not forget the rotttenchilds and rockefeller didn't always pretend to be jewish they pretended to be whatever they needed to be for MONEY and POWER.

You)The people that our corrupt and Jewish-infiltrated governments seem to serve first and foremost is Jews, specifically the Ashkenazi. To ignore that is to be wilfully ignorant and it's odd that you have such a strong desire to excuse their central role in many of these things. I agree that all of these corrupt people deserve to hang, and I'm focusing on the largest single player in this sordid game, because I think there is truth to the saying that cutting the head off of a snake causes the body to die. I'm not advocating for bloodshed and I honestly and sincerely believe that society tends to make the right choice when given all of the information pertaining to this or that. Some people are smarter than most people but nobody is smarter than everybody combined.

R) I agree that the government does use Israel as a cover but specifically to the Ashkenazi? i would like to see proof of that. i've researched government corruption for a long time and allot of them are supporting Israel directly but any jew who has read his Bible knows and rejects the notion of Israel, thats why so many have not gone because they know its a lie and a sham for money and power. Im not excusing anyone role, again,You point to the Ashkenazi as if we could just Kill ALL of them and poof all satanic ritual practices would disappear. The problem is allot bigger then that, and its wishful thinking that we can just come in, clean up one religious group and done.  You say ''I'm not advocating for bloodshed '' why not ? You would spare these pedos? These abusers of the innocent, you would imprison them? Not only are you blind but you're resolve is weak. These people are subhuman and don't deserve the laws of men or God.

226,dxvmqlv,"&gt;The far right is more clearly flawed than the far left, as he has said repeatedly.

Why would you focus on washing dishes when your house is on fire? This is a red flag that highlights JP can't see his own biases. He has hardcore tunnel vision as if his emotions are blinders.

&gt;I certainly think Jordan is bringing people towards the centre 

Who? The left doesn't like him or consume his content. The conservative moderates and the alt-right listen to him and use his constant and ambiguous begging of the questions to reaffirm their already-reached conclusions.

Just from a recent and random video I picked out, these are some of the top comments,

&gt;ImperfectWeapons (80 likes): ABOUT THE ""JEWISH QUESTION"": I think the more intelligent concern that people have about Jews being overrepresented in politics and media has less to do with the suspicion that Jews are conniving goblins working under a unified conspiracy and more to do with the fact that they're an already successful, influential, and socially protected class of people who also get to masquerade around as oppressed minorities that need to behave as an in-group to survive. In that way, there is no one in our society that is having their cake and eating it more than the Jewish community is now. Folks especially can't stand seeing groups like that throw around identity politics, and it's not a good idea to leave something like that unacknowledged by anyone but the genuinely hateful. You can bet your ass that any truths you leave by the wayside will get picked up, spun, and used against you.﻿

&gt;Death By Cognitive Dissonance (682 likes, subscribes to PJW, Milo, Black Pidgeon Speaks): After hearing that biography introduction. It's clear JP has only one ""measly"" item left on his bucket list. Save Western Civilization.﻿

&gt;GL (149 likes): I've always considered myself as being liberal, as being on the left, but this movement to radicalise everything on that side is both surprising &amp; disappointing to me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V32WHDuy-Do

There are several very likely deductions we can take from this pattern,

1. He's not moderating leftists (I saw a total of one comment saying JP has persuaded her from the left to the right, so I don't even know if this would be considered moderating so much as simply pulling people to the right).

2. He's not moderating rightists (I have yet to see a conservative mention ""I was an alt-righter ethnostate advocate, but you've really opened my eyes to the horror of that position!"" which should be no surprise since he never speaks out against such issues, only how the left is bad and evil and muh postmodernism like a dolt).

3. It's very easy to be alt-right and a JP fan. Like I said, you can very easily take his content and use it to reaffirm your views. Within his totality of the hundreds (thousands?) hours of content, he's spent a whopping 3 minutes in a video, and 1 blog post (about 2 pages or 6 paragraphs long) actually addressing radical conservatism. It's also worth pointing out that the vast majority of his comments in both the 3 minutes in the video and that blog post are saturated with his content consumers rebuttalling him and tell him that ""no, there actually is a conspire, and Jews are working to undermine Western Civilization"".

If you were a super popular public speaker and so many of your comments were literal Neo-Nazi talking points, wouldn't you take a step back and think ""Why am I resonating with these people? What is it about my message that attracts them?"" I'd be horrified, and I'd have the intelligence to comprehend that something is causing this. JP is clearly an intelligent person, so the only conclusion we can reach is that he's intentionally doing it. He knows and doesn't care, for whatever reason. He's complicit, which is ironic considering how much he talks about evil."
227,dxkqs8c,"Yes. That is where you will find hate for that religion; maybe pedes can get off my back about hating israels guts for a day and point the finger at the actual antisemites. (Also fuck off that deport button, folks. I ain't playin. I'm allowed to hate an evil government body, no that doesn't mean I wanna gas my fellow Americans or anything.  I just believe it's beyond past time to hold the Israeli government accountable for their actions.) doesn't mean that you can go around assulting every Jew on earth just because they believe in a different version of God than joe blow or Mohammad over there. The line between anti Semitic and anti Israeli is blurred unfortunately by the holocaust. Any criticism is treated as a sadistic and hateful approach because people are too damn touchy about the holocaust, still. Once Israel can't hide behind that accusation the whole ponzi scheme nation will come tumbling down and all the regular everyday Jewish folks are going to find themselves surrounded by unreasonable, angry Muslims. I find it really sad that the Jewish folks are often characterized by the country and not their religion. It's an unhealthy loyalty to a piece of land more than a religion, it seems like. I guess my conclusion is:


Tl/dr
Regular everyday Jews = good 
Israel = bad 
Also FUCK Palestine and the damn shithole Muslim nations over there. I ain't some trolling lefty I just don't think anyone in that geopolitical sphere will ever be a friend to anyone but themselves and that Israel gives Jews a bad name by being a corrupt shithole like every single other middle eastern country and it's doomed to fail without the US babysitting them.

""In the book (200 Year Together) Solzhenitsyn documents the overrepresentation of Jewish individuals in the NKVD  and the Bolshevik leadership. He claims that the ethnic hatred these individuals had for Christians played a role in the Holodomor. Jewish individuals had faced persecution in Ukraine prior to the Bolshevik rise to power. These individuals exacted their revenge on the Christian Ukranian population. The result was the death of 4 million Christians. 

The line of good and evil cuts through the heart of every human. One cannot simply say a given ethnic group is evil. Every individual must struggle with the good and the evil in their own heart. That being said, it is important to understand what motivates groups to commit atrocities against other groups because the previous century has been filled with groups killing other groups.

Like the Bolsheviks, Jewish individuals are overrepresented in the ownership and senior staffing of the US news media. The news media also is inexplicably hostile towards Russia. If the current war mongering against Russian Christians is in any motivated by the same ethnic hatred that motivated the Holodomor we must face that truth honestly.

If Jewish individuals hated Christian Ukranians enough to starve millions of them to death could the same thing happen today? 

Could Jewish individuals use their positions of power to seek out revenge against places like Europe and Russia that have a history of expelling Jews?"""

231,drurrl9,"So we don't need any Soviet, American or Israeli documents to show the Polish Jews are missing. The census of the Polish Republic in 1931 counted approximately 3.1 million Jews for 8% of the population. Poland now has less then .01% Jewish population. None of that relies in any way on Soviet, American or Israeli documentation. It's based on the Polish census of 1931 before Poland was a puppet of the Soviet union. The Polish Jewish community is well attested and existed because of the tolerant policies of the Poland-Lithuania Commonwealth which led many Jews to move their and led Poland to become the center of European Jewry prior to world war 2. That number cannot be in Israel or else half of all Israeli Jews would be descended from Poles.  Now as for the 15 million after the Holocaust well it's one source and I can find studies which contradict it pretty easily, [this](http://ljhskweitzman.pbworks.com/w/page/21291319/World%20Jewish%20population%20over%20time) and [this](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/28/jewish-global-population-approaches-pre-holocaust-levels) Yes the first is an unsourced graph but the second is from a think tank with proper methodology I do notice for the later page the Jews by country are cut off. Even if we do accept it then where is the Polish Jewish community where did those three million go? They are not in Poland anymore and are not in Israel so where are they? Unless you dispute the 1931 Polish census they have to be somewhere. 

Finally the Soviets were dishonest evil bastards the perpetrated the Katyn massacre, and numerous crimes against their own citizens and Stalin killed millions of innocent people. But, they never accepted the Western holocaust narrative and were indeed quite critical of it. The Soviets never taught the holocaust the way the west does. The framed it as a fascist genocide against all Soviet people, so why would they fake evidence to support a narrative they disagree with.  

Finally we do not have direct order for the holocaust but we do have quite a bit of written evidence. 

http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html

and speeches 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posen_speeches

(I realize this is wikapedia but they have the speech audio so I figure it's ok)

We also have the existence of several variations of General Plan Ost which calls for the murder of 100 million people and the enslavement of millions more thought Jews are not listed but if you are planning to murder tens of millions of Russians, why not six million Jews?

This is why I mentioned all the other stuff happening on the eastern front to show that many other numerous massacres and atrocities which were happening on the Eastern front many of which we don't have written orders for. The holocaust was just one more of these.

But ultimately all of that is immaterial, it could all be fake and we'd still have a mystery on our hands, if there were 15 million Jews before and after like the almanac posits, we'd still have a mystery because the Polish Jews are not in Poland and not in Israel, so where did three million Yiddish speaking Poles vanish to. Again these number come from the 1931 census nothing Soviet about them.  

"
232,dmf7tro,"It just continues the same Jew-phobia that the church has tried to push off for centuries. Brings back the idea that the Jewish hierarchy is an evil group looking to kill Jesus. Sure the Roman prison guards aren't portrayed well either but those are hardened men working for Pilate, a man who upped the execution count by a lot when he was prefect. Why are the Jewish high priests portrayed just as blood thirsty as Roman prison guards hired to execute people and who are surrounded by death every day? It just seems to push forth the ""Jews killed Jesus"" message that is still strong enough that Pope Benedict felt to need to remind everyone that it isn't that simple. Even the way they look are different: you could tell that Gibson casted the high priests with Jewish stereotypes in mind yet people like Jesus and Mary Magdalene look like Italian models (one of them actually being so). The removal of Jesus from his Jewish heritage is not only harmful but is just historically incorrect. The most damning is the final line from Caiaphas about how Jesus's blood will be on the hands of their descendants. This is the stuff that kept anti Semitism and flat out fear of Jewish people alive in the church for so long. Gibson has tried to walk all this back but this is also a man who went on an anti Semitic tirade on police record (not to mention all his other tirades he's tried to brush under the rug), so I'm less likely to believe him.

But you don't just have to take my word for it. Much has been written about it; that's why I said I'd be surprised if this is the first you've heard about it. Or we could just say the Jewish community is too defensive...I guess that's easier."

234,fddmr71,"Pour comprendre tout ce bordel, il faut revenir dans le passé.

L'Iran était une démocratie au lendemain de son indépendance jusqu’à ce que le premier Ministre Mossadegh, qui voulait nationaliser le pétrole, soit renversé par les britanniques et les américains. Il a été remplacé par le Shah.  

Le Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi était un ""modernisateur"" occidentalisé et un boucher soutenu par les américains contre l'URSS. Pendant ce temps, le Liban, petit pays avec 18 communautés religieuses plonge dans le chaos en 1975. En 1978, les Israéliens interviennent car ils en ont marre des tirs de roquettes et ils lancent l'opération Litani. La même année, la Syrie de Hafez El Assad intervient aussi car ils considèrent que le petit Liban leur appartient. Ils se font casser la gueule par les Israéliens. 

En 1979, le Shah d'Iran est chassé lors de la Révolution Islamique. l'Iran devient une République Islamique et déclare comme ennemi les Etats-Unis (le grand Satan) et Israël (le petit Satan). Le pays prend en otage l'Ambassade des Etats-Unis. L'Arabie Saoudite prend peur. La même année, prise d'otage à La Mecque par des  hommes lourdement armés. L'Arabie Saoudite décide de devenir beaucoup beaucoup plus conservatrice. Hafez El Assad, qui n'aime pas les Islamistes mais vient de se faire humilier par Israël, décide de s'allier avec l'Iran. L'Iran commence à soutenir les Chiites du Sud-Liban pour former le Hezbollah, le parti de Dieu, qui attaque les Israéliens puis les Français et les Américains.

En 1980, l'Iran est attaqué par Saddam Hussein, soutenu et armé par les Occidentaux. En 8 ans, la guerre a fait 1 million de morts.  Depuis, l'Iran étend son influence partout dans la région et le Hezbollah a organisé plusieurs attaques terroristes contre des juifs (Argentine) et des civils israéliens (Turquie, Bulgarie, etc..) pour faire pression sur Israël. 

En 2000, Israël finit par quitter le Sud-Liban et le Hezbollah crie victoire. Le Hezbollah annonce alors que il combattra jusqu’à la destruction totale de Israël en multipliant les menaces. La Syrie alliée de l'Iran occupe toujours le Liban et le Hezbollah n'y voit pas le moindre problème. Néanmoins, au Liban, il se présente comme le ""défenseur du pays"" contre un Israël ""agressif"". 

Le Premier Ministre libanais Rafic Hariri, qui voulait que les Syriens partent, se fera liquider par le Hezbollah sous l'ordre de Bachar Al Assad. Ni Assad, ni le Hezbollah, ne l'avoueront jamais. Les partisans du Hezbollah - et ils sont nombreux au Liban - refusent toujours d'y croire.

Depuis, les incidents se multiplient.

L'Iran est une théocratie semi-électorale pas comme les autres. Ils ont des milices armées dans tous les pays de la région et sont hautement sophistiqués. Ils voulaient développer une bombe islamique. L'Arabie Saoudite menaçait de développer des missiles nucléaires si l'Iran s'en dotait. Puis ensuite, tout le monde (Turquie, Qatar) auraient suivi ce que ni la France, ni les USA, ni la Chine, ni la Russie, ni personne ne veut.

Obama avait signé un accord sur le nucléaire estimant que le commerce renforce la bourgeoisie et aiderait les modérés de la société iranienne, que ca amenerait une démocratisation de l'Iran. Il expliquait que c'était le choix le moins pire : 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpX9k_YhUTQ

Il y a 5 opposants au deal : 

* Les Arabes du Golf
* Le Gouvernement Israélien 
* Les Évangélistes
* Une partie de la communauté juive américaine 
* Les Néo-Cons américains  

L'accord avec l'Iran a provoqué une véritable ""guerre civile"" au sein de la communauté juive. Obama a assuré aux Israéliens tout son support contre toute attaque de l'Iran ou des proxys de l'Iran. Il a tout fait pour rassurer la communauté juive.

Pour beaucoup d'Israéliens, Netanyahu en tête, le deal de Obama était absolument scandaleux. Ils ont tout fait pour démolir le deal car pour eux, ça aurait donné des milliards au Hezbollah et autres milices qui les menacent : 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT66ZXwH5xU

l'Arabie Saoudite avait déjà demandé aux américains de ""couper la tête du serpent Iranien"" : 

https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/monde/wikileaks-iran-tete-de-serpent_942282.html

Pour les Israéliens, Obama ne comprend rien au Moyen-Orient et aux Perses. Il est un grand naïf. Les Iraniens pro-démocratie, leurs meilleurs alliés, ne vont pas être renforcé par le deal. Le régime Iranien va les broyer, se refaire une santé et se reconstruire un arsenal encore plus fort. Puis ensuite, le problème se posera de nouveau en pire.

Depuis des mois, l'Iran achemine des roquettes  de haute précision au Hezbollah au Liban. En Syrie, apres 9 ans de guerre civile, les Iraniens tentent d'encercler Israël via la Syrie en construisant des bases et en utilisant des missiles et des drones explosifs.

Ah yes, avoid that synagogue of Satan, which is a culturally neutral term used in modern social policy."
238,fy6ryre,"&gt;It is an absolute fact that 90% plus of Jews are “zionists” in the sense that they believe in the right of and need for Israel to exist, for reasons so obvious

Except Zionism isn't just a ""Jewish homeland"" any more than White Nationalism is just a ""White homeland"" it's a philosophical and ideological movement with tenants and texts and context. It was born out 19th century European Supremacism and Colonial theory and still holds those ideals close to it's core even till this very day.

&gt;and that among those rights is that of self-determination in a nation-state.

This is not an inalienable right and never has been for a specific racial group. There are literally thousands of different ethnic groups on earth, last time I looked, there are only about 200 nations. Also the ""Self-Determination of Israel"" pretty much means the eradication of Palestine and it's peoples, where is their self-determination?

&gt;Your argument effectively holds that non-Jews have the right to decide whether the Jews are a people or not; that the Jews are not a people and as such, have no collective rights; and that because of this, the Jewish state is some kind of abomination and/or the catechism of human rights and equality.

What is this gobbly gook? Most ethnic groups on earth exist without some sort of ultra-nationalist apartheid ethnostate. Most ethnic groups don't even have nations. How in fuck is saying Zionism is a unethical ideology saying ""Jewish people don't deserve rights?""

&gt;You fail as so many do to understand the deep rooted political, historical and religious roots that connect judaism to Israel, in its ancient and modern forms. It is absolutely fundamental to who we are - even if we have never or hardly ever go - I haven’t been for 40 years btw.

Except, Zionism wasn't even supported by a majority of Jews until the mid 20th century and was seen largely as a fringe ideology and if you want to get even more technical, the religion itself forbids Israel from even existing. This still completely ignores that Zionism is a ethno-centric settler-colonial ideology that literally views Palestinians as inferior subhumans, I think Herzl put it best ""300 years behind the intellect of European man"". Also again, I don't give a shit if it's ""Fundamental"" to who you are, you only believe that because of Nationalist brainwashing. Isn't that also an Antisemitic trope as well, that Jewish people hold ""dual loyalties""?

&gt;As Ben-Gurion once put it, Zionism is not a question of the Jews and the Arabs, it is a question of the Jews and the world. The world’s responsibilities to one of its smallest and most horrifically oppressed minorities is, or ought to be, clear. The dereliction of that duty—the declaration that the Jews alone among peoples are not accorded equal rights as a people—is self-evidently racist.

So you build a state and engage colonial ethnic cleansing and ethno-nationalism and claim you're actually the most horrifically oppressed minority on earth. The idea that Jewish people are horrifically oppressed in the modern world is frankly laughable.

&gt;And i still didn’t vote tory. The idea that jews are resolutely right wing is offensive and wrong. We’ve been driven away but many will return.

The Jewish community is overwhelmingly right wing and it's class interests do not align with Labour at all. It hasn't voted for the Labour party for literally decades.

&gt;Historically, there has been huge support for the Labour movement.

Yes, when Jewish people had a ""working class"" character decades ago. Even you're own Chief Rabbi said in the 1980s that British Jews were the first ethnic group to ""overcome"" having a ""working class"". It is absolutely not in the class interest due to the median wealth of British Jews to vote for Labour and that has been evident in voting patterns for yonks.

&gt;Suggestions to the contrary are untrue and seek to paint Jews as far right pseudo fascists

Break out the hyperbole here! Yeah I totally think being a Tory = Being a Nazi.

&gt;itself a racist trope.

Ah yes, the crazy idea there could be Jewish fascists is so insane, except you know, Irgun, The Stern Gang which now formed into the ruling party Likud, all have their roots in the Fascist movement (The Stern Gang even worked with the Nazis!)

&gt;No one “overrides” anyone else’s views - I certainly don’t deny the Palestinians right to a homeland.

Except your support for Zionism, does. You could, like any sane person, support a functional fair two state solution or a secular federalised single state system, but Zionism holds that Israel must be a Jewish state, which means, bye bye Palestine and that is how Zionism has MATERIALLY FUNCTIONED IN THE REAL WORLD FOR THE PAST 70 YEARS.

Also Jewish voices do ""override"" Palestinian views, the IHRA definition was instantly weaponised against Palestinian groups and activists and demonstrations, forcing the outright ban on Pro-Palestinian activism in several activist spaces, also you have the McCarthyism against BDS literally getting people fired from and locked out of jobs.

&gt;We Jews do not have to apologize for anything. We are a people like all other peoples. We are what we are. We are good for ourselves. We will not change and we do not want to.

Okay, but then accept your Zionism is a supremacist racist colonialist ideology and you support ethnic cleansing and so does your community and frankly, I'm not asking for British Jews to change, I question why Labour throws so much political capital into a tiny right wing minority group that doesn't vote Labour and never will.

God amazing to see you Zionists still spouting your same incoherent arguments from the Hasbara Handbook."
239,fy8e6mz,"&gt;The BLM mouth pieces have minimized the Holocaust &amp; the struggles of Jewish people &amp; now want to claim they are the true descendants of the Hebrew people. The Jewish community is upset for so many reasons over this &amp; it's honestly pretty disgusting. 

I legitimately don't understand where this sentiment even comes from. I'd like to consider myself a novice historian &amp; that sentiment holds pretty much no weight or solid evidence. I've talked to dozens of people who consider themselves ""black Hebrew Israelites"" and i can guarantee they failed history &amp; biology.

- first, because their history is typically off by several thousand years. They try to basis their belief system around 3000 years ago without realizing there is another 100,000 of human Evolution to account for.
- they don't understand how biology works at all. You'll typically hear these people say ""the white race was a mistake"" or ""the whites are inferior"" or ""we were made in gods imagine"". There was a long road of evolution and people adapted to their environments its why we have ""whites"" its really that simple. 
- along with the fact ""black"" doesn't equal African its how you can tell these people haven't been out of their western country or studied history. DNA shows a decent portion of coastal Africa had non black Africans living there as early as 3,000 years ago. 
- or the fact they believe Europeans kidnapped innocent Africans right out of their villages but in reality they were sold by other Africans on the coast of Africa. 

Their entire ethnonationalistic viewpoint is based on lies &amp; revisionist history and it really pisses me off."
240,fid7w93,"Wow, for being at a mechanic shop, you made a brilliant post!  

I feel like I learned a lot.  

&gt;Judaism, on the other hand, strictly prohibits proselytizing; it is deeply taboo to attempt to burden other people with one's personal religious beliefs.  

I feel I have a new respect for Judaism for this. You are right about Christianity and proselytizing. And it is a scary notion. When one must adhere to placing God first and foremost, doing all they can to ensure souls are saved and right with their God, it is a recipe for disaster when they are told their God isnt welcome. It is almost a challenge for them. To put it another way, suffering tends to be glorified. They are taught that if they are suffering and being met with backlash, they are on the Lords path.   

I truly wish they would learn from history. When the church has been in power before, bad things happened to countless people.  

There was another user I chatted with on here a few weeks back, who said he was of a church that actually taught its members how to put aside their personal feelings towards a subject, such as abortion, in order to be there for another human. In that sense, they found a way to put their god and faith first because it was synonymous with putting the human first. So that was refreshing at least!  

&gt;and to impose them on the inferior sinners who are ultimately going to hell anyway, regardless of their consent to be so goverened. IMO, this grotesquely paternalistic, moralistic orientation is at the root of a whole lot of the difficulties regressives seem to have with issues involving the consent and bodily autonomy of members of outgroups.  

Very insightful stance and I can definitely agree with this. The issue also gets complicated then, by the pushback. Rightly deserved, but it tends to just add fuel to their fire for the reason I stated above. For Christians, the idea of being oppressed (for lack of a better word) means they are in exactly the right place. The place where God wants them to be.  

The problem is, what they perceive as oppression is not oppression. If you are hitting someone with a stick and I take away the stick, I am not oppressing you. I am stopping you from oppressing someone else. There is a difference.  

There are two ways in which to make the playing field fair and equal for all. One, is in uplifting those who are in need because they have been systemically pushed down. The ones being beaten with the stick. The other, is in removing the privileges afforded to certain groups that were undeserved in the first place. The ones beating people with sticks. And Christian churches fall into that category. But they claim they are the ones being beaten with a stick.  

&gt;So in part, I think what you perceive as insufficient volume about reproductive freedom from the Jewish community is about that difference in perspective about what is an appropriate level of religious entanglement with law and politics.  

&gt;I guess, then, what I'm saying overall is that although Jewish people tend to be more circumspect about loudly insisting that public laws be modeled after their specific dogmatic idiosyncracies, that is quite different from a ""refusal to take a stand"".   

I stand corrected! And I was not aware of the involvement from the Jewish community in ensuring abortion access, especially pre Roe. Thank you for teaching me something!  

I think the reasoning that led me to think that perhaps there was a lack of involvement was due to the fact that I have been too busy paying attention to the person wielding the stick rather than the person stepping up for the one being beaten. Because of course the stick wielder is the one more easily noticed.  

And I am honestly ignorant of how abortions were obtained pre Roe save for the Science Vs Abortion Underground podcast (listed in the sidebar)"
241,evw2qhj,"That is not my claim to African-European racism and I probably should have specified. Think of racism within Europe. Romani(gypsy) and Jewish individuals are more readily considered. In many cases an American wouldn't know unless someone said ""look that person is gypsy, you can tell by their (insert apparel or facial structure here)."" African-European racism is basically ""I observed inferior societal structures to my own, therefore they're inferior"". Then later the mark of Ham was used as justification when they could no longer reliably claim ""inferior society"". European racism is defined by ""these people committed this wrong against us/society or actively commit them to this day""."
242,euza66i,"now youve switched from regimented to traditional.  sexist regiment. sexist tradition.  it does not change the ethics.

Being a rabbi is not just being the religious leader - agreed rabbi is the leader of the community as is cantor

women are not allowed to be the leader of their own community (clearly sexist)

the rabbi is the leader of the Orthodox Jewish community.  women can do what which is equivalent to being the head leader of the Orthodox Jewish community?

I did not say they pray all day.  I said ""The 2 biggest leadership positions of Orthodox temples are Rabbi and Cantor.""  You literally quoted this and then made up a different quote to respond to.

&amp;#x200B;

"" Women don't need to lead prayer/synagogues to be valuable in the Orthodox community.""

women are not allowed to do this.  men are allowed to do what they want.  this makes the women inferior. the women have less freedom to choose their career than the men and the women are not allowed to be the head leader  of their own community.

&amp;#x200B;

""​Comparing the president, where there is no longer any law requiring it to only be a man, and a rabbi does not fit. Two totally different things with different functions in religious and secular society.""

I am saying that there is a law requiring the head leader of Orthodox temples to be a man.  Just like there was for POTUS.  saying the leader must be a man is clearly sexist

&amp;#x200B;

""You don't have to be a rabbi to be a leader in your community. That's like saying nobody except the owner of a large company ever makes important decisions. Or it's like saying you need a title to be important. A person's worth comes from their actions, network, and talent, not from their credentials.""

The women cannot be the head leader. The CMV says ""as Rabbis or Cantors"".  The women are allowed to take on lesser leadership roles. this is unequal and sexist.

&amp;#x200B;

""There's just some social stratification involved in the traditions.""

a nice way of admitting that women are inferior to some degree in the Orthodox Jewish community.

""but again, that doesn't mean Orthodox men in general regard women as less.""

i did not say they generally regard women as less.  I just said this specific policy is clearly sexist. and this specific policy sends a clear message to the daughters in the Orthodox Jewish communities.  You can never be the head leader of your own community because you are a girl.  Your brother can because he is a boy.  You can do many of the things your brother can but not the head leadership which is for boys only.  This clearly means women are not quite equals to men. 

You're making it to black and white.  Either sexism is extreme and generalized or nonexistent.

I never said the Orthodox community generally treats women as inferiors.  Just that this specific policy in the Orthodox Jewish community is sexist and treats women as inferiors."

This is one of the most sanctimonious, disingenuous, manipulative, hypocritical bunch of people on the planet and no one should give them any air-time or credence.

The fact that the BBC and Guardian constantly allow them to act as spokespeople for the British Jewish community is a clear indication of their bias."
248,emxey6m,"I agree. Denouncing BTS is fruitless. Which is why I said the ""BTS do them"" comment. I don't nessesarily agree with it but I'm not going to put effort into stopping it. I get what you're saying about stewardship and I think the best way to do that is through action. We don't have an Asian Malcolm X to martyr for us and I don't expect to see one any time soon so your idea of using BTS to open the doors to other AMs helps. 

When BTS first came out, we heard the stereotype ""They all look alike"". Now, fans, especially non-Asian fans, can easily tell them apart. This is a good thing. People are realizing that they are not robots. That they have their unique styles and personalities. Do they still look effeminate? Of course. But eventually, people will say that about them individually, and not Asians as a whole(hopefully). Which was my point about the band My Chemical Romance affording that benefit. No one said, ""White people look gay"" when they wore make-up. This will take a while but I see that happening especially when the older generation dies off. Even Andrew Yang is gaining lots of support from non-Asians. 


We can definitely learn from the Jewish community which is why everything I buy is made in China. I've read conflicting reports but the general consensus is China will surpass the US by 2030. The media pushback is going hard against this, especially on reddit. It's just noise. 

I try to keep things into pespective. I've noticed AMs getting treated much better is just a half generation compared to when I was growing up. By all mean, it could be better and if we ignore the look of Kpop stars, it's getting us noticed. Part of the reason why the Jewish community is strong is their women support them. As we both know, our women are as loyal as stray cats. This is coming from a cat(and dog) owner. But that's subject for a different thread."

People don't advertise it, especially since the jewish community is still very protected (obviously, because we fucked up reaaal bad in WWII), but it's more common than ever. I think it's because the Jews are a very tight knit community here, so people always assume that they're somehow conspiring to gain power? It's just odd. Being accused of being a jew is like the most common insult for politicians now, that or being a freemason. Or both.
