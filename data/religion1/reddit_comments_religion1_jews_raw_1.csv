0,fxy78g9,"I'm only speculating here, but I'd guess that it's because Farrakhan is so divisive within the Black community - not necessarily between the Black and White communities. By speaking out against Brees, a player would be standing with virtually all Black players. What Brees said was also in the midst of the height of BLM protests, so Brees's words came off as salt in an open wound in a very visible space. 

The plight of Jewish Americans is relatively invisible compared to that of Black Americans for a variety of reasons. One is that it's significantly less severe in the United States. Another is that Jewish Americans are generally perceived as economically successful - while this may be broadly accurate to a degree, it means that Jews, as a people, are perceived as greedy and exploitative by many and therefore deserve the discrimination they receive. I posit that this stereotyping of Jews as greedy goblins that rule everything is stoked heavily by many ultra-wealthy non-Jews to deflect from their own greed - but that's another topic for discussion. Also, the worst atrocities against the Jews occurred outside of the United States - ""it can't happen here"" is a common notion in America regarding fascism and genocide. These factors combine to paint Jews as non-victims and sometimes deserving of the hate they receive."
1,eu6p1m7,"&gt; I called her racist because she's critical of Israeli people and doesn't distinguish between them and the Israeli government. 

That isn't close to true at all.

&gt;I called her racist because she evokes the greedy Jew stereotype when talking about ""Israel"". 

She has never done that.

&gt;I called her racist because she uses age-old antiemetic rhetoric like accusing Jewish Americans of having dual allegiance. 

That's a complete fabrication. Israel supporters and Jewish people are not the same thing. Most Israel supporters in the United States are Christians, large numbers of Jewish Americans are deeply oppossed to Israel and support BDS. In fact, it is antisemitic to claim that all Jews support Israel as you are doing.

&gt;I called her racist because she supports boycotting the livelihood of Israeli people who not only aren't synonymous with their government, but are often the most outspoken critics of it...based only on their ethnicity.

She doesn't support boycotting anybody based on their ethnicity and neither does the BDS movemnent.

It isn't racist to boycott an apartheid state. It wasn't racist when it was targeted at apartheid South Africa, it isn't racist when it's tareted against apartheid Israel.

&gt;That does NOT mean I support Israel because I don't. I also don't support Palestine for that matter.

Yes it does mean that you support Israel. As Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said: ""If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality. ""

&gt;I simply don't support war, or military violence of any kind

BDS is a completely non-violent tactic.

&gt;and don't buy into propaganda trying to tell me which side is ""right"".

One side is an ethnostate that practices apartheid and commits genocide. The other side are the people who are being murdered and oppressed purely because of their ethnicity. If you weren't a racist you'd see which side is in the wrong.

&gt;I support criticising the government, and both Palestine and Israel do deserve to be criticized.

There is no government of Palestine.

&gt;I just don't believe that should give anyone a free pass to criticize Israelis or Palestinians as a race of people, or to perpetuate racist stereotypes about them.

Ilhan Omar has not done that."
2,eh9ppvt,"So two things, I've been told many times that ""white people can't help being racist, it's just how they're raised.""

Also, would it be okay if I said Jewish men are greedy or Asian men have small dicks? It shouldn't bother them because it doesn't apply to the Jewish men who aren't greedy or the Asian men that are well endowed right? Why couldn't the above meme have said alt-right instead of white guys?"
3,e8y4yi4,"Fox news did a segment on Israeli spying in early 2000 

https://archive.org/details/israeli-spying-in-united-states.

It was removed and de platformed platformed after ADL push for ""spreading antisemitic conspiracies""

These deplatforming and suppression networks aren't limited solely to ""Israeli nationals"", we transformed between 1960s to today to have an unofficial racial caste system at this point wherein Jewish-Americans are the ultimate ""protected class"" and Americans of all ethnicities are basically a worker class (except when minorities have issues with white Americans in which case they get special attention, but not otherwise)

Look at the Brown/Black/Hispanic advocate Thomas Lopez-Pierre who can't even attack greedy landlords and gentrification because the landlords are [the ""protected class""](https://forward.com/news/370288/new-york-politician-attacks-greedy-jewish-landlords-could-he-win-race/)

4,e4kfbww,"Ok I'll adress your main point again and for the last time : I stopped reading after you made a blanket racist statement about an entire race of women and stereotyping them. Just as I would stop reading if someone would write all Jewish men are greedy, all muslim men are rapists ,all black men are thugs. You immediately disqualified  anything that followed after by making this gross racist statement and no I will not entertain such hateful language against any racial group.


You can backtrack and explain all you want but that is the jist of it. You made a racist statement and now like a racist you keep trying to go back and qualify your racism with anecdotal evidence besides multiple times misquoting me( I admitted myself for example that my experience was just anecdotal evidence which you either misread or are misconstruing).

The Holocaust is a scientific fact as is that black men and women are stereotyped as overly sexual and agressive (amongst others ) in the US. Both these things are well documented , feel free to reread my link on that.
You keep using the stereotype of the angry black women (sooo racist) without acknowledging that it is a stereotype Bäder on racial oppression and instead claim it's the truth. 
Just because you claim it's the truth doesn't make it so, please educate yourself in your history, racial stereotypes and the oppression of black people in your country and how stereotypes fed into this.

We are just going in circles at this point and you either purposely are misreading several points I made or you and I will have to agree to disagree.

Have a good day and let go of your anger and racism, it will not make your life any better."
5,e0buczr,"You're not promoting progressive social change or equality, you're just another regressive racist, apparently.  This is **not** social justice.

Your statement is so obviously hate speech, I will be interested to see how it is punished.

There are two simple rules \-\-  
\* Equality means equal rights and consideration for everyone, not for particular groups.  
\* If you change the gender or race of a statement and suddenly it's offensive, it was offensive all along.

If it's okay to say ""Absolutely white males are more prone to racism"", then it's also okay to say ""Absolutely more black males are prone to crime"" or ""Absolutely all Jewish men are prone to greed"".  All three of those statements are equally offensive.

6,dhbzdm6,"Actually, it all started with Martin Luther, who was the predecessor oft modern antisemitism which is different from religious antijudaism since it views jews as a race, not a religion (in christian antijudaism, jews could convert and therefore escape eternal damnation vor whatever, the ""race"" jew cannot be escaped).
Luther claimed jews weren't able to do manual labour (since most guilds were Christian only, most jews were forced to make their living via moneylending or academical jobs.
And man, Germans do love their manual labour.

In the 19th century, when the modern German state was declared, you had a rise of antisemitic progroms and ideologies, for example the Wartburgfest where fraternity members burned books by jewish authors, and philosophers like Gottlieb Fichte wrote stuff like: ""Dude, jews are like, the total opposite of us hard-working, strong, nature-loving, national Germans because they don't work and jewish men are kinda super gay and they don't have a country and national roots"".
Also, the surplus value was personified within jewish people, but this would take *ages* to explain.

After Germany lost WWI, the far right came up with a conspiracy theory, the "" Dolchstoßlegende"", saying that jews and communists (for Germans, jews can either be greedy capitalists vor filthy commies, whatever fits) hampered a German victory because this is what jews and commies do in their spare time. And since jews already were a handy scapegoat and antisemitsm a part of German ideology like beer and kraut...

You know the ugly rest, and you still have a lot of antisemitism in Germany today because unfortunately, reeducation didn't work that well.

(This guy also seems like a bonkers conspiracy theorist, Schulz is definitely not jewish afaik)"
7,evdu98y,Jewish men are more likely to be in higher education and jobs as Asians. Also non Jewish whites consider Jewish guys too nerdy for them.
8,eve22si,"This is the truth. It's not about being jewish- it's about being having the same educational attainment and jobs as Asians, while also providing white privilege. 

&gt; Also non Jewish whites consider Jewish guys too nerdy for them 

I've noticed this- I've heard Jewish men complain in the same way as AM- ""oh, girls don't like us. they just assume we're small nerds... etc"" As such, Jewish men are much more open to dating AF than other WMs"
9,e7y2mpu,"Jewish men are seen by western society as less masculine than white men.  The stereotypes of jews and that of east asians are fairly similar: less masculine, less physically large/strong, nerdy/geeky, high earning etc.    
"
10,e2t7q8i,"Actually, it's seen as fashionable to make fun of jews these days. Like you can say that jewish men are ugly, nerdy, have jewfros, and have small circumcised wieners and get away with it lol

Also, being Jewish is a massive dealbreaker for non-jewish women"
11,dxqh4ku,"&gt;Perhaps in the past but in modern society that kind of propaganda doesn't exist, infact the OPPOSITE exists 

Are you fucking stupid? Indian Men, Pakistani Men, Asian Men are portrayed as weak, nerdy, gullible or as dorks in the West. Black men are overwhelmingly portrayed as thugs and criminals, Jewish men are looked at with this weird, almost puritanical view. 

Your idiotic comments are quite racist, because it is the race that sets the category for rejection, rather than personal traits. You are reducing a person to a race rather than a human being with emotion and ideas when you reject them and then saying ""I don't date blacks"", or ""I don't date Jews"".

12,dm48fu8,"&gt;In early July, trans activist and writer Zinnia Jones wrote a tweet about attraction between straight cis-men and trans women. “I don’t see a problem with telling straight guys who are exclusionary of trans women partners that they should try to work through that,” Jones said.

&gt;Jones wasn’t saying that straight men have a moral duty to date trans women; she was pointing out that who is and isn’t considered attractive is often tied to social or cultural prejudices. People know that they’re only supposed to find thin and/or young women attractive. By the same token, Jewish men are stereotyped as nerdy and bespectacled, so when you’re a very Jewish looking guy (like me!) people sometimes see you as unattractive without even really looking at you. 

I dunno this shit reads exactly like incel ""women don't date me because they're shallow sluts"" to me"
13,difslg4,"If Jewish women outmarried at 50% rates while many Jewish men are left to die alone because non-Jewish women are taught by society and the media that Jewish men are unattractive effeminate misogynistic bastards, and Jewish feminists constantly demonises Jewish men while dating white supremacist neo-nazis who wanted to crack Jewish skulls open, then Jewish organisations would rally together and call it a holocaust.

But when it happens to Asians instead, crickets chirp, huh? You don't even realise it, and keep denying it.

What do white alt-right neo-nazis and white-passing nerdy Jewish guys have in common? They both lust after Asian women but hate Asians as a race and especially Asian men or Asian-looking hapa sons!

I guess this is a source of pride for you, right?

Make sure you tell your half Asian son why none of the Jewish girls at his bat mitzvah are into him but all the women who look like him are into Jewish men who laugh at him.

16,fvj7gc1,"Just to elaborate a tiny bit. breaking Shabbat and breaking kosher and not doing bris , result in a punishment called Karet (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareth).   If modern Judaism has adapted to consider breaking those other things as not the end of Judaism so to can it be done for circumcision. Especially considering it can be done later, if the person they themselves want it.   
  
Another interesting point, according to even the most strict Jewish law , the child is Jewish if the mother is Jewish. No other requirements, end of story.   
  
In a secular world where they can still have an attachment to Judaism even if they don’t keep kosher etc, they can do the same without a bris. I’m speaking as Jewish(secular )man went to Jewish day school, Jewish high school, had a bar mitzvah, has read torah countless times, celebrates high holidays and Passover every year....and not once has proof of a bris ever ever ever had to been verified in order to participate.   
Jewish men are more than their penis"
17,fwxnmju,"I'm ethnically Jewish and have done extensive research on this question. It's certainly possible to overestimate the responsibility of the Jewish people for Routine Infant Circumcision in the US, but I don't think Jewish-Americans are blameless either. In other words, in some hypothetical alternate world where there were no Jewish Americans, I do think RIC for non-jews in the US would be less common. How much less common is difficult to say. I hope no one will consider what I have just said particularly offensive."
18,fw297c6,"Why do you think that only Jewish men are allowed to protest circumcision? Do you think that *only* Jewish men are circumcised? 

Any man of any religion who is circumcised can. You say they don’t, with a pointless stipulation and I pointed out that you were talking to one who was doing it. Your cognitive dissonance is showing."
19,fx0qz0b,"Not a Jew, but I am involved in the intactivist movement (anti-circumcision) so I feel like I may have some pertinent info for you.

Have you heard of Brit Shalom? It’s basically a bris without the genital mutilation, and it’s been catching on among more liberal Jews. I know you said you’re an atheist, but a Brit Shalom May help your parents feel better. Especially if they see how many other Jews are choosing it. The movement has even taken root in Israel.

You should check out Eric Clopper on YouTube. He’s a Jewish man who has done a ton of research and speaks out against circumcision for religious reasons. His presentation is long, but VERY worth watching, and I think it’s worth noting that some Jewish men are very angry and resentful at the circumcision they endured as babies. It’s commendable that you don’t want that for your own son.

It’s easy to understand wanting to uphold traditions, but when those traditions mean genital mutilation, it’s especially hard. There are people for whom NOT mutilating the next generation means that they have to come to terms with what happened to them. They don’t want to think about it, and just blindly continuing it means they don’t have to.

Babies have died from it, complications are common, and often not detected until the boy becomes sexually active (and therefore highly unlikely to complain to his parents,) and anesthesia is almost never used. Babies don’t “sleep through it,” they go into shock. Some fail their hearing tests after circumcision because they’ve blown out their eardrums from screaming so hard. They keep a cardiac arrest kit nearby when circumcising because that’s a possible complication. And infections from the wound in a diaper full of urine and feces are common, too.

I’m glad you’re questioning this horrible practice. It’s not good for Jewish men. They deserve to be left whole, too."
20,fxbymus,"Muslim and Jewish men are circumcised because of their religion, but circumcision for other people started with John Kellogg ( inventor of cornflakes) and other sex-phobic people. They thought that circumcision would stop boys from master baiting( it didn’t work). After the people who were circumcised for that it was just fathers who thought his should look like mine."
21,fv207xm,"Yes, you can get circumcised as an adult - like I was. I am originally from Europe (The Netherlands) where circumcision is uncommon due to its association with religion - Jewish and muslim. Traditionally all Jewish boys are circumcised on the 8th day of their life which is called a Bris. Also, all (I believe) muslims are circumcised although I do not know exactly at what age. Beyond that, circumcision in Europe is done for medical reasons but as a last resort more because of the religious stigma it has there I feel.  I moved to the US as kid and was a bit surprised my first day in the locker room to see that everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, was circumcised. And nearly none of them were Jewish or Muslim. As I found out, here in the US circumcision is recommended and done for health and hygiene reasons. Americans are nuts for hygiene FYI. Normally in the US all boys are circumcised when they are born and it's uncommon not to be. Something like over 80% of US men are circumcised and I've actually never known of anyone here that wasn't. There are a many [proven health benefits](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/circumcision/about/pac-20393550) in being circumcised - reduction of STDs, STI, HIV, infections, penile cancer, etc..  And of course the elimination of the many issues being uncircumcised can cause like Phimosis (tight foreskin). Given the health benefits, it's become standard here in the US. Personally I had some issues with a recurring urinary tract infection and when the doctor saw I was uncircumcised, he recommended I get circumcised. Which was standard and routine if you had any issues and not been done yet. This was the 90s in the midwest and not sure if it's still like this. Anyhow, now I am circumcised. 

So to answer your question, although usually done in infancy or as a young boy, you can get circumcised at any age. It is often associated with religion but it is very common to get done for medical  or hygiene or preference reasons. Over 30% of all men worldwide are circumcised so it's pretty common to get done."
22,frfuglr,"&gt;but there's nothing positive about circumcision.

There might be, like not getting phimosis or penile cancer. Or feeling culturally accepted because that's a male ""beauty standard"" in some parts of the world. 

&gt;I am also very bothered about it being a tradition in the US for example..

You might want to r/AskAnAmerican 

&gt;only being bothered by Jewish circumcision would be sort of anti-semitism

Yes, because if you did the math more non-Jewish than Jewish men are circumcised."
23,fqogsrj,"First of all, it is common in the US because of the belief that it inhibited masturbation. Nineteenth century Americans were petrified of masturbation, giving us graham crackers, Kellogg's, and a subplot if *Doctor Strangelove*. Later it remained popular because circumcised men were less likely to get STIs. No one bothered to notice that communities that regularly practiced circumcision were Jews and Muslims, who had fewer sexual partners than Christians. To this day, proponents argue that the rate of HIV infection is lower among circumcised men. Now they're ignoring that this is largely observed in Africa, where HIV infection in straight men is largely associated with other STIs that leave open wounds on the penis. Female-to-male transmission rates are low in the rest of the world. 

However, in ancient times, circumcision was seen as an identifying mark. Jews, and later Muslims, were circumcised. This made them different from their non-observant neighbors. Jews practice circumcision at birth, but Muslims do it at age 13, around the same time as Jewish boys are Bar Mitzvahed. Both these ceremonies mark the transition from boyhood to manhood. 

So...what indicates that a girl has entered womanhood? Menarche, when she has her first period. Robin Walker has suggested that in Neolithic matrifocal societies, women were seen as having power because women had the ability to create life. And a start of this ability was indicated by *blood coming out of her genitals*. Thus, when men sought to take over power in society and create a patriarchy, they had to indicate their power by *causing blood to come out of their genitals*. To this day, when men take positions of power, whether as judges or kings or priests or scholars, they don garments that resemble dresses.

24,frfuo00,"Well, why not just wait till after you get phimosis to circumcise? I'm not against circumcision for medical purposes. Also I'm not sure circumcision has been proven to stop penile cancer if you account for factors like smegma and phimosis.

25,fn892k1,"Jewish male here. All Jewish boys are circumcised at eight days old (health permitting) to remember, symbolize, and uphold Abraham’s circumcision as a covenant to G-d."
26,fkl37ip,"We all hate circumcision here, but Jewish men are victims as well, and not the cause of all this."
27,fkrol6c,"Jewish men are victims until they decide to inflict their ritual mutilation on babies.

I'm a Jew and I have such mixed feelings on the rhetoric surrounding Judaism in the anti-circumcision movement.  On the one hand, I truly appreciate all the comments in this thread condemning anti-Semitism and acknowledging that Jews are people, not a hive mind.

However, I was cut due to my mom's religious beliefs (it was literally the most religious thing she ever did), and I'm not aware of any other ideology on the planet that claims infant mutilation is central to its existence.  My discussions with other Jews have easily been the most frustrating.  Most Americans cite outdated medical articles or throw tantrums, but devout Jews straight up *ignore* me.  They don't even want to hear it.  I tell them, ""I'm Jewish and I don't like what happened to me,"" and they refuse to engage.  They can't even acknowledge that I'm telling the truth.

So yeah, bigotry is bad, *and* I don't want to let Judaism as an ideology off the hook.  We have to find that middle ground, because unfortunately, some people call *everything* anti-Semitism, and that's counter-productive."
28,flz7dwc,Framing your condemnation of circumcision by asking how (without circumcision) Jewish men are going to be able to put babies' dicks in their mouths suggests that babies are circumcised so that Jewish men can carry out this sick practice. This is a classic Antisemitic trope - Jews are filthy and depraved.
29,f9ihg9p,"Circumcision is the process of cutting the foreskin off of the penis. In slang terms, being “uncut” or having an “uncut cock” means you’re uncircumcised, whereas “cut” means circumcised. Jewish men are almost universally circumcised as babies as part of their religious beliefs."
30,f3xhig7,A Jew. With a circumcision. Like Jewish men are required to have.
31,f5gshxb,"Not everyone who is circumcised is done so for cultural reasons, there are medical reasons too. For example, I had phimosis, which is where the forskin is too tight, resulting in pain when urinating. The easiest fix to this is (or at least was at the time) circumcision. It's not just for masturbation prevention, though I think thats a reason why many Jewish boys are circumcised. But dont quote me on that."
32,f0rpiuk,"&gt;...circumcision is considered ***a type of wounding of a man***.  This may sound cruel and barbaric, but it is not.  What it does is help prevent the man from raping and harming women in the future.  *Jewish men are known to rape women much less often than most other groups.*  *They also tend to treat women much better than other ethnic and religious groups on planet earth.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Thus, the concept of wounding of men is not a cruel concept.***  It is related to women’s health and safety."
33,f24np76,"You married a Jewish woman who gave birth to a Jewish son. Jewish boys are almost always circumcised, even if their families aren’t particularly religious, since it’s an ethnicity and culture with a cultural religion as well. You can ask your wife if she’s willing to consider brit shalom, which is a ceremonial naming as an alternative to brit milah (circumcision), but when it comes down to it you’re saying you don’t want your kid to have the first and most basic tie to his culture. If you didn’t want your sons to be Jewish, you should’ve married one of the 99.8% of women who aren’t Jewish."
34,exf0lps,"Sorry if my points were not clear. I am trying to address the issue from a legal and constitutional perspective, and if this ever went to court the distinction between cosmetic procedure and religious practice would become extremely important at least in my opinion. Our opinion of the morality of the procedure is pretty irrelevant compared to how the courts could potentially interpret this. 


Female genital mutilation is definitely not a new practice. However it is most prevalent in select Islamic communities. Islam is a fairly young religion, much younger than Judaism for example. I have no idea how old the specific Islamic groups which practice fgm are. Given the fact that male circumcision goes back two around 3,000 BC, at least according to the Jewish faith, there is a difference in how long both of these procedures have been performed. The importance of the procedure of male circumcision compared to female genital mutilation in religion is also important. The vast majority of Muslim and Jewish  men are circumcised. Worldwide about 30% of men are. The prevalence of this and importance in different cultures worldwide plays a significant role in how a court would interpret the validity of the practice. 

However male circumcision done for purely secular reasons based on cosmetics could engender a very different interpretation. I think that the legal cases for cosmetic circumcision would be much harder to make than that which is performed in a religious ceremony.

given the multicultural nature of our society and the importance of male circumcision as a religious ritual in certain communities, this would have to be given a lot of weight. Historical attempts to ban circumcision have also been used by anti-semitic groups in order to persecute Jewish communities. the historical baggage behind these kinds of laws is important to take into consideration."
35,em5tssz,"That's not quite true; the Jewish tradition (more like superstition, tbh) is that you don't discuss names before the baby is born, in case of a miscarriage or stillbirth or severe birth defects. Ditto for baby showers or even preparing a baby's room. Once a baby is born, though, it gets named right away. The naming that occurs a few days later at the circumcision (for boys) or the next Torah reading (for girls) is more of an official/ceremonial kind of thing.

And you're right that Jewish boys are named at their circumcision, which takes place 8 days after birth, but that waiting period is actually due to the fact that babies' blood doesn't begin to clot properly until a few days after they're born. We're a very practical people: yes, we perform an inexplicable and medically unnecessary surgery on every baby with a penis, but at least we wait until the baby can handle it!"
36,emsu7ey,"Circumcision. Its genital mutilation and its fucking disgusting. Did you know that people in Madagascar eat the forshin of their sons? Did you know that orthadox Jewish boys are forced to get circumcised by a rabbi, after the surgery the rabbi sucks the blood from the babys dick!?!?? And there are many cases of babies dying from herpies because of the rabbi having herpies? Absolutely feral."
37,eiwbm3n,"The simple answer is that the physical state of a person has no effect at all on the offspring. Acquired characteristics are not inherited. A giraffe's neck isn't long because it's ancestors strained and strained to reach leaves, blacksmiths don't have children with stronger shoulders and jewish boys are born with foreskins, despite thousands of years of circumcision.

Before Darwin and Russel-Wallace came along the dominant theory for how evolution worked was so-called Lamarckian [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism), which dictated that traits acquired during an organism's lifetime would be passed down to the offspring.  


Darwin (and Russel-Wallace) suggested an alternative mechanism for evolution, namely [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection), which is now known to be the 'correct' mechanism. Evolution by natural selection dictates that there is no connection between a parent's physical characteristics and their offsprings' predispositions to develop certain traits. Random genetic variation in a population will result in individuals with variable genetic '[fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology))' who are consequently more or less likely to produce offspring and thus the genetic makeup of a population will change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

The complex answer necessitates learning about epigenetics and is much more complicated to understand, but still basically the answer is that acquired characteristics are not inherited."

41,ee01dqb,"These communities were among the hardest hit by the Holocaust. Most Eastern European countries had death rates well over 80%. Pre-war Poland, a significant center of Jewish life had a pre-war Jewish population of between 3 and a quarter and 3 and a half million Jews. Three million Polish Jews were killed, half of the approximately six million killed. Each story of each town could take up thousands of pages. Because violent resistance was often impossible, and always deadly, major forms of Jewish resistance focused on cultural resistance, and once even this was impossible, through personal, spiritual resistance. Ghettos were the major centers of cultural resistance, since in the places where ghettos were established there was often a period between when the Holocaust started so to say and when the mass killings through shootings or deportations to killing centers began. In many of the places where there was not ghettoization there wasn't really time to create communal cultural responses. In many of the areas of eastern and south eastern Europe which had been centers of Jewish life the killing happened very fast, sometimes within hours or days of the Nazi invasions and so any cultural responses were impossible, or at least looked very different than it did in the ghettos. The same is true for western Europe, but for different reasons, either because the lead up was so long, as in Germany, or because there wasn't much warning before deportation. The places where there was this time between normality and extermination were when real cultural resilience and resistance on a large scale could occur. A western example would be the art created in Drancy and the art, writing, and theatre created in Terezin. During the Holocaust there was varying ability to create cultural life, but in most cases there were attempts, even if it was only small or personal, such as keeping a diary. To keep this moderately short I'll give a short overview of Warsaw and Vilna, because they were two of the main pre-war cultural hubs. 

Warsaw, one of the major centers I discussed was ghettoized. The Warsaw Ghetto housed around half a million Jews. During the first year in the ghetto people attempted to maintain cultural life. Underground Yiddish newspapers continued printing, theaters were established, as were schools and religious centers. Much of the cultural life was focused on survival, organizations like Alaynhilf (The Jewish Self-Help Organization) sprung up providing what little food was available to those who were deported into the ghetto and so had few belongings to trade, which was the major way of getting food in the ghetto. The Ghetto had a significant underground life, Emanuel Ringelblum, the leader of The Jewish Self-Help Organization established an underground archive called Oyneg Shabes, much of which has survived, and some of which is available online (Notes from the Warsaw Ghetto, Who Will Write Our History, and Isaac's Army). Women created a courier network, getting information into and out of the ghetto (Jewish men are identifiable by circumcision, while women who were fair skinned/haired and spoke non accented Polish could pass). Children created a network of smuggling to bring much needed food into the ghetto. Major pre-war cultural figures like Janusz Korczak remained major figures in the ghetto. Many of these figures were involved in Ringelblum's underground archive. Cultural activities in the open mostly ended during the large scale deportations to Treblinka in the deadly summer of 1942. The underground activities like Oyneg Shabes remained, documenting the deportations. At this point many of the Jews in Warsaw, especially the cultural elite were aware of the gassings at Treblinka, and most would die there. Young people, especially those who had been politically active in the pre-war youth movements and in radical parties like the Bund in 1943 as the ghetto was being liquidated, became the fighters in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Most of the youth movements consolidated into the Jewish Fighting Organization (ZOB) headed by Mordechai Anielewicz, but the right wing, more militarily trained Betar split off into its own fighting force, the ZZW though they often ended up fighting and dying together as the ghetto was destroyed. A few of the youth leaders, such as Antek Zuckerman, Zivia Lubetkin, and Marek Edelman survived, but most were killed. Most of the Jews of Warsaw were killed. Today there are only 10 or 20,000 Jews in Poland. 

The same kind of intense need for cultural resistance, and the interplay between cultural, spiritual and violent resistance was replicated in other cities like Vilna, Kovno, Bialystock, Lublin, and Lodz, and in partisan groups. 

In Vilna, another pre-war hub of Jewish life, the resistance was completely intertwined with the pre-war Yiddish literary scene. Like in Warsaw, the community was essentially completely destroyed. The ghetto had housed about 40-55,000 Jews, and through mass shootings, disease, starvation, and deportation to death camps the ghetto was completely destroyed. A few hundred Jews from Vilna survived in the forests as partisans. In the ghetto an intense cultural life was created. Music performances, plays, and lectures were common in the ghetto, and hundreds of pages of music, poetry, and personal accounts were written in the ghetto and as the Jews of Vilna were being systematically slaughtered. Many working in the FPO (United Partisan Organization) and in partisan units came from Vilna literary society such as the poets Abba Kovner, Avrom Sutzkever, Hirsch Glik, and Shmerke Kaczerginski (look into The Book Smugglers). Sutzkever and Kaczerginski, who had worked with YIVO, worked in the ghetto to preserve cultural and literary documents, and they were able to save some 8,000 books and other documents. Avrom Sutzkever and Abba Kovner survived and continued writing in Israel. Hirsch Glik was killed, but his anthem Zog Nit Keynmol (The Partisan Song) became a ballad of Jewish resistance during and after the Holocaust. His music has become central to Jewish memory, and Jewish music in general. Kaczerginski, who collected some 250 songs written during the Holocaust, survived, but died in a plane crash in 1954."
42,e5ftn68,"Oh no. 

This woman is known in academic circles for her polemical views on circumcision. 

She cites studies from the 80s/90s, when infant psychology and anaesthesia was relatively primitive. Also, the notion that the cortisol release associated with circumcision  ‘permanently alters the brain’ is pure pseudo-science. 

In the West, Jewish men are most likely to be circumcised. Therefore participants of various studies are largely Jewish. Jewish Americans are at a greater risk of developing depression/mental disorders than other religious minorities- this is well documented. This isn’t caused by the ‘trauma’ of circumcision, but a complex mix of genetic dispositions, socioeconomic and cultural factors. Hence, the studies conclude that circumcised men are more likely to be mentally ill, but proves no link between circumcision and mental illness. 

Correlation =/= causation.

43,e04j61c,"There are cultural reasons people circumcise and I’ve already said I don’t believe that it has any religious merit. However there are many that do believe that there is merit based on whatever beliefs they have. Culturally and socially it’s an accepted practice and these facts will make banning it almost impossible.

For me the real reasons for considering it are medical. Here’s a nice summary of some relevant research. 

According to the Science News Letter “The reason for circumcision is cleanliness, to prevent accumulation of an irritating buildup of smegma in the narrow space between the male glans and the overlying foreskin.” An article in Today’s Health explains that “smegma can becomes a breeding ground for bacteria which cause irritations and infections some severe. 

Studies made in America, Europe and Asia have disclosed a much higher incidence of cancer of the penis in uncircumcised men than in circumcised. M. S. Eiger, M.D., observes, “Cancer of the penis virtually never occurs in a man who was circumcised in infancy.” These studies have been so conclusive that even an outspoken opponent of routine circumcision in the U.S. admits: “Poor sexual hygiene, inadequate hygienic facilities, and venereal diseases tend to increase the incidence of genitourinary cancers in the ethnic groups or populations that do not practice circumcision. In these groups, then, circumcision would seem to be indicated.”

This same doctor, however, does not feel that routine circumcision is necessary in the U.S., where a high degree of personal hygiene is convenient. An article in Woman’s Day states that “adequate hygiene confers nearly as much protection against cancer of the penis as circumcision.”

However, cancer of the cervix, the third most common cancer killer of American women, is virtually unknown among Jewish women. Many authorities feel that the fact that Jewish men are circumcised is a factor contributing to this.

A study made in Yugoslavia compared circumcised emancipated Moslems and uncircumcised non-Moslems. They found twice as many pre-malignant cervical lesions in the wives of the uncircumcised non-Moslems as in the circumcised emancipated Moslems (11 per 1,000 in the former, 5.5 per 1,000 in the latter). Interestingly, they found that in the Orthodox Moslems the occurrence of this was nil.

But is circumcision cruel? To some the protection afforded by circumcision more than compensates for the momentary discomfort. Given modern medical proficiency and medications it makes the procedure safe, efficient and usually without complications. This is nowhere near as cruel or insidious as female genital mutilation which has absolutely no medical virtue and is true abuse which has long lasting negative repercussions. 

I’m for changing public perception especially in the US that it’s wrong and not acceptable to have an uncircumcised male. I’m not for banning the practice medically nor forcing others to change their religious or cultural practices; education yes, penalties and abuse charges no that’s unrealistic and won’t happen.

Americans getting rowdy or not being able to handle themselves while drunk has a lot more to do with the fact that they can't drink til they are 21. In Europe, a lot of families will give their children wine with dinner or sparingly starting at like 14 years old. This allows them to understand it better by the time they are ""of age"". In America, you turn 21 and it becomes a fucking free-for-all because you haven't gotten your feet wet.

Your other points are just you patting yourself on the back. So 87% of men are uncircumcised; and mainly American/European/Jewish men are. So are you saying those 13% cause most of the rape? Because their penis is a ""more efficient *weapon*""? What about all of the unreported rape or *accepted* rape in certain areas of the world."

48,drw3tf9,"&gt; Literally everything we do for our children is forced on them.

Yes, but most of that is supposed to be good for the child and not in violation of their right to bodily autonomy. Children are not, for example, forced to have parts of their clitorises removed, outside of some parts of Africa and the Middle East where the practice is widely condemned internationally.

&gt;  The reality (as far as I'm aware) is that there are no harmful long-term consequences if circumcision.

While there are usually no severe negative effects from circumcision, [complications, which could easily be avoided simply by not forcing children to be circumcised, do arise, and in extremely rare cases even result in death] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision#Adverse_effects). There's also the fact that it violates someone's right to bodily autonomy.

&gt;  My family is Jewish (non-religious/atheist) and like the guy above, it is part of our culture.

Female circumcision is part of many people's culture too, but I doubt anyone here thinks they should be allowed to force it on their children.

54,dha882z,"As a Jew, stepping in here re: your first point, because it's just wrong. 

**There is no Jewish law where rabbis suck on baby penis during circumcision.** 

*Metzitzah b'peh* is a custom, just like wearing head coverings is a custom in Jewish tradition - not law. It's not mentioned in the Torah anywhere that men have to wear a yarmulke/kippah on their heads, but is widespread to the point many people mistake it for Jewish law. 

Ditto this for first drops of blood following the circumcision: This isn't in the Torah. Metzitzah b'peh remains a *custom*, not a law, and it is only practiced by a tiny fraction of ultra conservative Orthodox communities. But do to misinformation spread by the commenter above, somehow ppl this this is some kind of de facto standard in Jewish ritual circumcision. Far from it: it's the VERY rare exception to the norm. 

Pretty much 99.9% of *b'rit milah* (ritual circumcisions) do not perform this unhygienic, severely outdated custom. 

Also, the word you're looking for is *mohel* - the person who actually performs the circumcision. Not all rabbis are mohelim - most aren't. But a whole lot of pediatricians, pediatric surgeons, and pediatric urologists ARE mohelim, which means that more often than not, a b'rit milah is performed by a medical professional. 

But a lot of folks don't know this, and instead perpetuate wrong information about what actually happens when Jewish boys are circumcised. 

 "
55,dhci7nk,"Yes!

Colossians 2:11-12 compares baptism with circumcision, and Jewish boys are circumcised at eight days old.

Acts 16:15 and 33 and 1 Corinthians 1:16 all mention entire households being baptized, which doesn't *explicitly* mention infant baptism but would nevertheless probably include them.

Matthew 18:6 and Luke 1:15 and 44 indicate that small children and even unborn children can have faith.

Still, I think it's less helpful to look for an infant baptism proof text than to consider what baptism does. If you believe, as Lutherans do (and as all Christians did until the Reformation piggybackers of the 16th century) that baptism is God's work and not ours, that it's far more than a mere symbol, and that something is actually happening... Then it only makes sense. If you believe baptism is a purely symbolic act of declaring faith, it makes no sense to baptize babies. If you believe that all people, regardless of age, are equally passive recipients of God's grace in baptism, then it makes no sense to withhold baptism from infants."

Jewish dad here, married to a Jewish unicorn, with two adult sons who are both MGTOW.

The difference today is conversion is so accepted and available...plus fathers no longer force their sons as in the past, as survival is not as hard.

The Golden Uterus, which is what a Jewish women used to have, as it is only through her that a child can be Jewish...
And at a time when Jews were not accepted in the secular world like today, so mixing was not good back then.

Today Jewish women have a huge problem(s)

They were raised thinking they still have a golden uterus, yet it is no longer so.

Plus most Jewish women are very educated and less dependent on husbands or men for their sustenance.

And it is true, Jewish women are not the best looking women around. I don't care who says what.

So, a Jewish man marrying a non-jew, will not be ostracized from the community as in the past.

If she converts and has a child, as long as the conversion is acceptable, the child (with additional prayer a ceremony) will be regarded as Jewish.

Jewish women are some of the most entitled and spoiled women around...

So add them up.

- No more Golden Uterus (but still thinks that)
- Not good looking on the same level as others
- Entitled and spoiled JAPs (Jewish American Princesses)
- educated with earning power
- Jewish men no longer being forced into ""continuance"" submission by their fathers, parents

I have two sons, one in Grad school, one in STEM...
Eldest is finishing up his phd in psychology, youngest has a Bcomm and is finishing up a bsc in comp sci, with plans to do an msc in comp sci.

Both my sons were raised physical, eldest practices MMA at a gym located in a Black and Italian area (he did not find the gym located in the Jewish area very competitive)
Youngest is a black belt and instructor of kick-boxing...competed in the free-style kumite circuit, and has had his fair share of wins and injuries to show for it

So, today, both do not want ANYTHING to do with Jewish women, at all...
Actually, to be fair, they only have women for short relationships...and as soon as she starts to question or get too permanent...she is gone and quickly replaced.

Here is what I wanted to communicate to you, as you probably already know about the other stuff I wrote...

...I can not tell you how much my wife and I are approached today, by fathers or relatives of Jewish girls who can not find a man - or sorry, can not find a man that they would prize.

There is not a week that goes by where I am not subjected to pressure from others having need.

Fathers of girls I do not trust at all anymore, as they are in pain watching their little princesses not get what they want.

I have been offered money, partnership in a million dollar business, and on and on...

My eldest has been to Israel 3 times, all for free...
Two of those times from a service put on by the Shul with the expressed intent of finding husbands for the daughters of the fathers who are members.

There was usually a 10-1 ratio of women compared to men on these trips, and few of the women ended up married.

This problem is going to get much larger, and the roles have reversed. So we keep our heads down and don't trust anyone connected to a Jewish girl these days, particular the parents.

The roles have reversed.

Jewish girls used to have the golden uterus and were in demand.

Today, it is the Jewish man who is in demand, as no one, or few men, Jewish or not, actually want them or are attracted to them.

Whereas Jewish women are spoiled and entitled...Jewish men are coveted today as being great husband material, by all women...

Oh BTW, Jewish women have the highest divorce rates, and highest rates for initiating the divorce.

Both my sons do not want anything to do with a Jewish girl, and they have my Blessing...

...who wants to be divorce-raped, or have to tolerate a spoiled princess...

62,ecemv1b,"So I think that your response is totally valid, and what he said is ""sort of the definition of a racist comment."" But for the sake of a second perspective/hopefully framing it in a way that hurts you less, I put forth the following.

What he said implicates two possible stereotypes about Jewish people. The first is the stereotype that Jews are miserly. That stereotype has been extremely toxic and destructive for much of human history, and it is almost per se derogatory. The second, though, is that Jews (really, it's Jewish women, so it's a stereotype twofer) are assertive/confrontational. This stereotype *can be* deragatory and offensive, but it's also something that a lot of Jewish women are proud of/a lot of people respect, honestly or grudgingly. (See John Mullaney's ""Jewish Girls"" skit, Buzzfeed's ""Perks of Dating a Jewish Girl"" video.) So, it's possible that it was a joke that relied on a neutral/mixed stereotype (Jewish girls are bossy) instead of the sterotype that has been so historically fraught, toxic, and catastrophic. 

Either way it's a joke that relies on a racial sterotype (or, technically, because of how he phrased it, it's actually an ethnic stereotype). And it sounds like that's what you're reacting to—that he didn't just call you bossy or assertive or confrontational, but implied that you are [negative trait] *because you were raised Jewish.* And like I said, I think that's a totally valid response. I think it's not too much to ask of a significant other that they assume that everyone has autonomy over how they behave, and not that their race/ethnicity/religion determines their conduct. "
63,dqe027d,"&gt;""Ideas about it being connected to jews or liberalism"". There is no softer way to put it.

It is not related 'to liberalism'. You have not expanded upon what 'liberalism' actually means. Hollywood sexual scandals are 'connected to liberalism' only because Hollywood is not as conservative, comparatively speaking. As it relates to Jews, the argument has been expanded upon beyond the absolutist straw-man.

&gt; Your elaboration of the argument: That's easy to disprove; the argument is to examine the possibility of revenge and shiksa fetishization as a motivation, not as ""THE"" sole cause

Yes.

&gt;Can be described like this: Ideas about it being connected to jews.

Not the Jews, per se, but the motivating factors across ethnic lines that are 'connected to Jews'. That is a dulled-down version that many interpret as an absolute argument against 'Jews', even though the main argument has more nuance (as it relates to Hollywood Jews, who lust after shiksas). 

&gt;I never said you said it was.

Then it is not connected ""to the Jews"", as you argue. The OP said ""hollywood sex scandal, and the ideas about it being connected to jews or liberalism."" Yes, but in what way? We can expand on motivating factors, but to attribute it to 'jews or liberalism' is a poor argument that the 'anonymous AR authorities' are not making (in good faith, or otherwise). 

&gt;The evolutionary perspective does not predict this. In the evolutionary perspective sexual assault is about sex, not about conquering or debasing. Debasing gives no fitness advantage.

The quote was: ""The evolutionary perspective also predicts that Jews would take greatest satisfaction out of conquering and debasing women who are relatively high status because these women are the most valued by their male competitors. Outgroup females  are especially valued if they are from a high-status group (e.g., sexually abusing WASP women from upper-middle class families would be more appealing than, say, sexually abusing lower class Black women; hence the satisfaction of the Portnoy character for his conquest of the “aristocratic Yankee beauty whose forebears arrived on these shores in the seventeenth century” and his comment that “I don’t seem to stick my dick up these girls, as much as I stick it up their backgrounds — as though through fucking I will discover America.  Conquer American — maybe that’s more like it.” Conquering American means conquering the women of the previously dominant elite first and foremost, and that means the daughters of the White, Anglo-Saxon Protestants who dominated America until the 1960s.""
The 'evolutionary perspective' does predict competing groups of peoples vying for sexual influence within society, in our human societies, at least. 
You are also ignoring the context within which the evolutionary perspective is mentioned; it relates to the competing sexual attention of various groups for a specific group of women. Sexual satisfaction is about 'conquering' the female and having her focus her attention on one male. In that sense, harems are the main goal for men who seek to expand their DNA as best as possible. In our example with Weinstein, you have a Jew abusing his power dynamic to further his own sexual interests. The argument is summarized: ""From this perspective, sexually abusing gentile women with impunity and taking advantage of gentile women who willingly give sexual favors because of the advantages to be gained from wealthy, powerful Jewish men are the ultimate aphrodisiacs for Jewish men — and particularly if they are sociopaths like Weinstein.""
Also, you would be remiss not to mention that 'fitness' is malleable and dependent on the society and organism you are discussing. In the case of Weinstein, 'debasing women' is his strategy and choice: the women gain leverage in Hollywood, and Weinstein gains sexual satisfaction. In the context of the Hollywood circles, he is incredibly 'fit'. 

&gt;Evolutionary perspective does not predict that women who are most valued by competitors should give greater satisfaction.

That wasn't the argument, it was not concerned with high-value women 'giving greater satisfaction', in the context of sexual satisfaction after 'wooing' them. The satisfaction is determined by the men who seek them out and offer opportunities to further their careers. 


&gt;Attractive, young, healthy women would increase fitness.

You are missing the point, it is not related to pursuing the most 'fit' females: they could if and only if the exchange was agreed upon. The women involved only engaged because they had something to gain from it, and were willing to disregard their decency. Also, the 'fitness' is related to the context within the Hollywood setting. It is an excellent evolutionary strategy for men who cannot compete in the department of health or attractiveness to resort to using their influence and power, which the women realize they can reap benefits from.

&gt;A little known fact about evo-psych hypotheses is that they need to be tested to be respected.

Sure.

&gt;The myth that sexual assault is about power or degrading or a need for revenge or dominance has it's roots in feminist literature, but slowly it became a part of everyday language.

You are still missing the point. It is not about 'male revenge' against women, it is about sexual assault based around ethnic lines and the fetishization of the shiksa. It is 'about power', if the Weinstein archetypes didn't possess influence and power in the spheres that the women sought to advance their careers in, then the interactions would not occur.

&gt;There is no actual data that suggests it, and it is contradicted by evidence from evolutionary psychology.

Because it's a truism: the powerless and without-status, like no-name actors, do not have anything to leverage their offers of sexual deviancy towards actresses with. Also, 'by evidence' is appealing to an anonymous source. You'll have to be more specific as it relates to the context of the discussion.

&gt;It argues from halfbaked evolutionary hypotheses

It was arguing about the sexual strategy and motivators of the Weinstein archetypes in Hollywood; they have their own marketplace for sexual offers and strategies to advance their sexual desires within.

&gt;mixed in with contradictory ideas from feminism 

Missing out the issue of fetishization of the shiksa and Jewish ethnic differences that would motivate this.

&gt;Do you believe that jews consciously displace whites, motivated by hatred, revenge and desire to dominate and dispossess?

When you decide to skim the article, like you admit to, and not actually read the articles within that expand upon the ethnic rifts between Jews and gentiles, who are at-odds in certain instances, then just asking a question of outrage will get you the result you seek. 
Jews are consciously displacing whites, when you have anti-racist organizations of Jews, acting as immigrants to further the cause of other immigrants, then they are destroying the demographic majority within European nations. There is an aspect of great revenge, as many of those Jews are anti-racists as a result of nativist, ultranationalist movements, like Nazism or other ethnic derivatives of fascism.
The 'desire' was argued for in the context of the Hollywood scandal, not this instance.

&gt;you are not arguing that jews are genetically disposed to sexual assault people

No, it is the result of historical instances of ethnic differences and the result those examples have had as it relates to the fetishization of gentile women.

&gt;that jewish ideas and historical grievances are behind it.

No, not 'Jewish ideas', more like Jewish attitudes. Historical grievances were argued for in the context of Jewish ethnic activism as immigrant groups in white European nations, you're getting the arguments mixed up.

&gt;So there is nothing in principle that would exclude republicans or conservatives.

If you observed many white Republicans targeting poor white black women with promises of 'gifts' or 'power', you could make an argument that there are ethnic differences that act as motivating causes behind the interactions. But that is not what is happening. As it relates to republicans and conservatives, you can observe the same sexual abuse and power dynamics, but not across ethnic lines (depends on the victims)."

2. Going against the UN and unilaterally supporting whatever Israel does both enables an Israeli foreign policy that is dependent on American aid and forces America into a contentious relationship with much of the world.  

This being said our relationship with Saudi Arabia is equally problematic.  Our failure to protect our Kurdish allies is also equally problematic.  

Really how America handles Hong Kong will ultimately determine how seriously the US is seen on the world stage.  

That being said our support for Israel is clearly du
e to lobbying by the Jewish community while America's  questionable relationships with other countries are more clearly connected to logistical significance and natural resources.   

The bigger issue (with regards to antisemitism) is that it is Jewish Americans who are inevitably the cause of American support for Israel.  Here is where people need to tread lightly because what is being implied bit not outright said or what can easily be derived from this logic is that Jewish Americans are choosing to lobby for policy that goes against American interests.  

If anti-Semitism were to become  mainstream in American society that would be more of a danger to jews globally than anything connected to Israel.  

Antisemitism means a lot less to the public.  Most of the world population is openly pro Palestine.  Many nation's that support Israel only do so because of their political ties to the US, which is becoming less and less relevant.  Moreover much of the world population and world economic power is openly anti semetic.  Being called and antisemite means a lot less in India than it does in America and is probably compliment in Pakistan and amongst the oligarchs of Russia.  

In America so many people are accused of being Nazis that the label is watered down and actual Nazis are now part of political discourse.  They are fringe, but they are a loud little minority.  This wasn't the case then or twenty years ago.  All those unite the right and alt right guys are not going to ransack black Neighborhoods.  Of those groups get violent they are going to go after Jews.  This rise in the racial politics of the right is economic.  Trump supporters aren't atiant Hispanics for cultural reasons.  Hispanic values are nearly identical to rural American values.  Trump supporters see Hispanic immigrants as a financial threat.  The rank and file neo-nazi is a broke white dude without many options.  They will see Hispanics and blacks as competition but Jews as the cause and also a group of people with lootable goods.  Nobody loots the ghetto or a trialer park because everyone is used to fighting and nobody has anything work stealing.

American-Israeli policy and the actions of AIPAC are the ideal way to promote anti-Semitism within the USA.  Then you can talk about Soros and the Rothschilds and by then they have drank the coolaid and will be near that point of indoctrination where a personn stops thinking and starts feeling.  That's the point where otherwise good people can easily be convinced to so bad things.  That is also the point when reason becomes less effective since the indoctrinated individual has adopted a new normal.



In the end it boils down to Israel.  The situation is worse and worse.  The Palestinians are like that kid who you have in a chokehold and you want to let out but who refuses to agree to stop fighting you once you do.  Israel, particularly settlers, continue to do dickish things that give Palestinians reason to doubt that Israelis genuinely want a peaceful solution.  To Palestinians a peaceful solution essentially means surrender of their land, property, and identity.  It is no surprise many Palestinians see the only solution is to reverse the changes made since the British mandate and remove the people who have moved since the mandate the way the population that was there before the mandate was removed.  
(The Koran does kinda say to do exactly that)

In America this is looked at as warlike and unrealistic but that is really only due to the attitude of invincibility many Americans have.  The Palestinians in excile still identify as Palestinian and often know, down to the exact address, where they were evicted from.  This combined with an American population tired of costly foreign engagements, changing demographics within America (many of which do not see the Holocaust as historys main attrociity but rather one of many ... Particularly a younger generation that learns about manefest destiny in a different way... Another instance where one ethnic group saw it as their right to remove another ethnic group because of divine right... Many of whom are from the Indian subcontinent and see Israel as a creation of the British to impose white values on brown people), a global environment where media isn't really controlled and anti-Semitism is pretty normalized and acceptable in circles that are now far more relevant due to changes in the global economy, and finally an America that is less relevant and likely to be more isolationist.  

Russia expanded America did nothing.

Ghadadi listened to America and was sodomized by a knife 

Turkey is slaughtering Kurds who were our allies and we didn't do shit


Everybody knows America is gonna watch 1984 play out in Hong Kong.


...

The day will eventually come when Americans will elect a president who is not gonna give to farts about either Israel or Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia knows that day will come the minute they run out of oil.  Israel relies on soft power.  This soft power comes from people liking Jews.  

In the end Israels hard liners mainly seem to be from outside the actual country.  If American Jews has to actually enforce what they advocate rather than just go on these touristic journeys that would probably get people talking in an honest way and looking for realistic solutions.  

 The idea that Palestinians will be totally removed is plausible.  This end game, however, will likely involve well over one hundred years of continued conflict, many of which Israel will need to ensure without the type of American support she enjoys today.  

That being said we can not rule out the possibility that the Palestinians will be able to remove the state of Israel.  This sounds rediculous now but imagine an apathetic or possibly antisemitic America and a powerful Pakistan.  Imagine if the Pakistani population of England became as influencial over British politics as the Jewish population of the US is over American politics.  

As the situation develops Americans will weigh the fear of being called antisemitic with the extent to which the situation negativity affects their life.  Right now the former is greater than the latter but the former is shrinking and the latter is growing."

69,evy0vdk,"Jew here. There are people coming down on you for the truth, simply because you're non-Jewish, and they're flat out wrong. This sub seems to have a problem reconciling white supremacy and misogyny, where people are willing to tip toe around misogynistic cultures in the name of being against white supremacy, all the while reinforcing misogyny for the women within the communities they supposedly care about. 

There is a lot of misogyny in Jewish culture because the religious practices, that are widely practiced currently, are extremely misogynistic, and that has an effect on the culture within households and among families. Not long ago, there was a viral video of a bunch of Jewish men coming from Israel, standing in the aisle of a plane because they refused to sit next to women. They also get mad at women when they accidentally cross the line at the Western Wall into the men's section, and various protests and legal restrictions have went back and forth to even stop women from reading out loud at the Western Wall. 

Orthodox Jews believe in covering women's hair, making them sit separately at synagogue with a wall between them so women can't be seen from the other side. Women are treated like they're impure when they're on their periods...a husband cannot touch his wife or have sex with her for a week while she's on her period and the week thereafter...to make sure there's absolutely no trace of a period. During the second week, women have to insert a cloth per day deep into the vagina, to check the color of vaginal discharge daily. If the color is questionable, it has to be inspected by a Rabbi....yes, a man must inspect your vaginal fluid. Then, you must take a bath - a Mikvah - to become pure again before having sex with your partner. There's plenty more things as well...

A lot of Jewish households uphold old school, misogynistic dynamics...domestic violence and sexually predatory behavior is common. Men feel entitled and are used to mothers that are doting and take care of everything for them. A lot of Jewish men are liberal, but not when it comes to women. 

Yes, patriarchy is everywhere, but among cultures that uphold patriarchal religions, such as Judaism and Islam, the culture is rampant with misogyny, even among the non-secular men of the culture."

When presented with a choice between the ""magic Indian"" or ""noble savage"" tropes that WW has historically relied upon (see the entrapment of Metathiax or basically anything in the back story of the Wendigo) and your low-key racist assertion that people like myself are inherently flawed as a result of ""intergenerational trauma"" the vast majority of us prefer the former. I know this may come as a shock to you but we don't need a white saviour to come along and help us rediscover our heritage, and we certainly don't need one trying to do so by twisting a beloved IP in to constantly portraying us as victims."

Most prayers are not sung, but are done silently, but as a group, with a prayer leading doing some parts out loud. Almost like a metronome. Some prayers are done out loud, but silent prayer makes up at least half the service."
73,dwuyrvw,"I think that it just goes to show that the US doesn’t have the same sensitivities about it and that Jewish Americans are stereotyped to the same standards as other groups like Italian Americans or Irish Americans.

I’ve seen many American stand ups in this regard and it would be hard to call it anti Semitic as it’s usually just making jibs at Jewish mothers/grandmothers being loud and overbearing or their Jewish friends being skinflints at buying beers. 

Nothing that’s actually harmful to the Jewish community like “the Jews are behind everything and control the media to weaken the west” or anything like that.

It also goes without saying that Jewish Americans have a very big presence in the comedy scene and it’s usually them making the jokes."
74,dl8g8a8,"&gt; Your misuse of communism means you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. At all. So we'll just ignore that.

Right, no idea what I'm talking about, except you know... actually growing up in a former Communist nation.

These tactics of social ostracization and demonizing well performing groups like White, Asian and Jewish men are the exact same shit our Commies used as an excuse to get rid of our intellectuals and well-off people during the last century. I just have to look at the Twitter feeds of some of these SJWs spouting shit about this incident, it reads like they're one step away from being ready to genocide White men if they had their way.

Of course everybody realized somewhere in the 60s that the idea of pitting proletariat against bourgeoisie led to some of the worst crimes of humanity and failed states, so the Marxist intellectuals in US universities and elsewhere came up with their new shtick of pitting oppressors against oppressed instead. Their revised ideology took further hold and spread in academia and nowadays you have US colleges pump out rabid SJWs that bought into the bullshit like crazy. Popular examples right now being Berkeley and Evergreen State College. You have more professors identifying as Marxists than as Conservatives in the US.

But clearly I have no idea what I'm talking about :)

&gt;Your assumption that the world is chock full of ""radical SJWs"" or that they have any real political sway is ridiculous. 

Yeah, ridiculous, it's not like these SJWs are a very loud little group that increasingly tries to influence policy to the point of becoming elected officials. See for example Brianna Wu, one of the SJWs that is right now using this little ""scandal"" to push her White man hating agenda on Twitter, who is also running for congress. Or the popular example of Anita Sarkeesian, another SJW bully that has been[ trying to influence elected officials](https://medium.com/@Doomskander/many-of-you-are-no-doubt-aware-that-recently-anita-sarkeesian-and-zoe-quinn-went-to-the-un-to-de74275535a9) with her agenda for years.

Apart from trying to influence government politics, they're also trying to influence company politics, as can be clearly seen in this incident and many, many others. Google isn't the only company hiring for ""diversity"" (=not White men) over abilities, [Github does the same shit](https://i.imgur.com/DT3Odf3.jpg) and there are plenty more examples in the tech world, too many to list here. It's really no wonder that there'll eventually be  backslash by White and Asian men mainly, who have been vilified simply for performing better academically and at their jobs or even just showing more interest in the matter than their female / Black / transgender aboriginal Muslima or whatever peers. It's why this document at Google went viral, because it hit a nerve with many people.

Of course software development is not exactly known to be a profession that attracts confident and ""take no shit"" people, rather the opposite, so these SJW bullies have had an easy time to find a footing there.

Please spare me your answer if it boils down to ""you're uneducated!"" and ""you have no idea what you're talking about!"" again."
75,foytx15,"&gt; incorporating that same flag into their own states' flags

This and everything you've mentioned are intensely controversial in America and speak to the misconceptions you seem to have.  Most who use the flag argue that it was their grandparents and great grandparents and great great grandparents who died and they should be allowed to honour them, and do not view it as some sort of call to slavery.  Then there are indeed some who do.  Again, you can't honestly decide that fraction of a fraction of a percentage of people represent the country any more than any other country's fraction of unsavoury people.

&gt;abortion

Abortion is not a religious issue and there are plenty of secular arguments against it on which to base opposition.

&gt;you have LGBTQ rights and other

LGBTQAAIPP2+ people enjoy the same rights as others in America, in all states.  While it's true in the past religious opposition has stood against it, religion, as said, has not been prominent in American politics since before Obama's second term.

&gt;The other thing is the idea that a candidate has less chances of winning an election for being an atheist, much like Bernie Sanders.

There is no evidence to support this and politics in the last ten years or so have shown a stark move away from candidates' faith to the point where it never comes up.

&gt;The problem is not in favouring your nation, the problem is in how much do you favour it.

Agreed, and Americans don't favour America too much.

&gt;But African American which comprise about 13% (not counting multiracial people) are unjustly treated all the time

This is more misconceptions.  

&gt; The simple existence of the KKK during the 20th century and the idea that a monument to organisation is still standing and was inaugurated by a vice-president

The KKK is nothing but a fringe group of loons who have ""what's under my cloak"" meetings every Sunday now.  If you're talking about Stone Mountain, the debate around the monument is that of whether it should be preserved for historical purposes.  You were the one talking about how evil the destruction of monuments is, weren't you?

&gt;Then you have the fact that African Americans tend to be worst off than white people, relative to population size, being only better off than native americans, which have a poverty rate of 24%

I'm not sure what you believe that has to do with ""racial superiority"".  Are you suggesting one race is better or worse than others because they're better or worse off?  As we know, Asian, Indian, and Jewish Americans are all the ""best off"", is this because of some sort of superiority in your view?  Do you believe Asians, Indians, and Jewish Americans as groups are oppressing everyone below them on the totem pole?  I'm not sure what citing this statistic is meant to prove.  

&gt;You think that from having the entire continent to themselves, to having their borders reduced over and over again over the years until they only had what they have now, and being the poorest people among the entire american population is fair?

That's incredibly fair considering most people in history who lose a war of invasion don't get to keep land, culture, special privileges, etc.  Right now Native Americans are Americans, plus extra.  No one alive during the European conquering of America is now alive anymore, neither victims nor perpetrators.  The fact that Native Americans are allowed free space in which to practice their traditional culture if they choose is quite accommodating.  

&gt;In relation to population size, black people are the most affected ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/police-shootings-2019/

White people are more likely to be shot by police than black people despite having fewer encounters.  You have a misconception that American police officers are gunning down innocent black men in the streets sparked by media lies like those in the Mike Brown case and others.  In reality most shootings, involving any race, come from failure to comply or hostile behaviour towards officers.  Black officers are also more likely to shoot black suspects than white officers.

&gt;As for LGBTQ people, the number of suicides between their ""ranks"" is superior to those of strait people, and that is largely thought to be due to a culture of dicrimination.

There is a correlation between LGBTQAAIP2+ people and mental health issues, especially trans people.  This rate does not seem to decline even in ""more accepting"" countries.  However, it's hard to imagine claiming that the country with the largest and most open gay community in the world, with the biggest pride parades and entire gay communities in cities, could be thought of as wholly a culture of gay discrimination, especially when it's illegal to do so.  

&gt;Are they? Really? If the american laws on firearms are ""of the best in the world"", why does it have the 28th-highest rate of deaths from gun violence

They are indeed.  Having the 28th highest rate is extremely good for a country with more guns than people, I'm not sure you're statisticing correctly here.  In America, guns are used around 300,000 times annually in crimes, while they're used anywhere up to 3,000,000 times in defense of self or others (according to the CDC).  97% of those gun crimes are committed with illegally obtained firearms.  The majority of firearms homicides (including mass shootings) are drug and gang related, committed with handguns.  In America you cannot legally own a firearm if you have a criminal record and all federally licensed firearms dealers must run a background check on purchasers.  Once again, you are painting the majority with the brush of an overwhelming minority.

&gt;I'm talking about the presidents on mount Rushmore, and most of them all, Washington.

Having statues and monuments of former presidents is treating them as deities?  I think you're getting a bit ridiculous and hyperbolic now.

&gt;I don't think I'm the misinformed one

I think you are.  Non-peaceful protesters forcefully attempted to stop a legally approved construction job and a security detail used non-lethal measures to ensure the safety of the workers. Using violence is not the answer, and storming across barriers to try to shut down some construction is not how a peaceful society operates.  It makes sense to sympathize with the tribe at Standing Rock, but it does not make sense to sympathize with aggressive assailents who got firehosed when trying to storm some construction workers just there doing their jobs they'd been permitted to do by the Federal government.

You seem to be taking the small imperfections of the United States and inflating them to dismiss the entire country as ""not that great"".  In reality, you're describing things either int he past or that are minuscule in the present.  I encourage you to travel to America one day when all this quarantining is finished and actually go around seeing places and meeting people.  Your view will change.  As a Canadian, we have an inbred culture of wanting to feel as though we're better than or different from Americans, and that seems like a sentiment that also extends to Europe, because American values are often different.  They're not worse.  

Valuing freedom of speech above all is great.  Having the highest economic mobility in the world is great.  Having the highest social mobility in the world is great.  Having a beautiful country from coast to coast is great.  Having a population widely varying from state to state is great.  Having a right to bear arms is great.  Being a cultural hub of media and creativity is great.  Being able to choose different states with different values to live in is great.  Having 9/10 citizens above the global poverty line is great.  Having opportunity is great.  Having a government that answers to the people in representative democracy is great.  Having a powerful military which is active in protecting not just America, but neighbours like Canada and other allies around the world is great.  Having lots of public land is great.  Having a constitutional declaration of prevailing first principles with which to course correct is great.  Having national events with which the national community can unify is great.  Having choice is great.

Greatness is not perfection, is just on the long road there.  You can list off the shortcomings of every country in the world and come away with a disparaging opinion if you ignore the strengths.  The best way to change your view is simply to go there, and see if your beliefs are correct."

 **RE: Israel has Hypnotized the world**
======================
First up, the entire tweet:
&gt;“Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” 

Clearly a case of bad choice of words, and the only accusation against her that on some level might have some antisemitic weight, However she has [repeatedly clarified](https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1087580647085039616) her intentions and apologized for her choice of language. 

Devil's advocate though, one of the [definitions of hypnotize](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hypnotize) is as follows; 
&gt;to influence, control, or direct completely, as by personal charm, words, or domination; 

&gt; *The speaker hypnotized the audience with his powerful personality.*

with 

and Allah means well, God. 

So in other words, technically you can rephrase that exact tweet as;

&gt;""Israel has Influenced the world, May God awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel""

You could also if you want worst case scenario rephrase it as ;

&gt;""Israel has controlled the world, May God awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel""

Keeping in mind, this was a tweet back in 2012 (before she had any power), and it is not at all unusual for people from religious backgrounds to beseech or implore God to help in a situation where they feel powerless. 

So assuming the best of her, she made a mistake in choice of words out of ignorance. Assuming the worst, she's hiding her antisemitism.  


==


In closing, When you ask someone to point to her ""Long history of antisemitism"", they can't find any beyond these 3 examples, 2/3 of which are entirely absurd (Especially because AIPAC != Israel != Jews. ). 

Now is this intended to conflate issues or because she's Muslim...etc ? Potentially, and track records seem to point to that, if one were to look at the only other example in recent history of [Keith Ellison](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/12/6/13819248/keith-ellison-dnc-chair), where his comments were taken out of context, and they really stretched to label him as antisemitic, and the fucked up part is, [IT WORKED](https://www.vox.com/2017/2/26/14740400/keith-ellisons-dnc-israel), even though he supported sending $27 million in military aid to Israel and he vocally opposes the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) anti-Israel boycott movement, AND was solidly supported by many Jewish organizations. 

The additional problem IMO is that the uproar reeks of a manufactured crisis especially when you consider most of the attackers, Let's take one of the most visible examples; For example Meghan McCain had no issues with her husband's paper (The Federalist) [defended Steve Bannon against Antisemitism](https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/11/the-federalist-says-steve-bannon-isnt-anti-semitic-because-jewish-girls-are-whiny.html) because he wasn't wrong to state the stereotype that ""Jewish women are Aggressive, demanding, pushy, emasculating and whiny"". 

She didn't seem to have as big a response to actual antisemitism from her own party, or her [fucked up response](https://splinternews.com/meghan-mccain-pisses-her-co-hosts-off-with-her-scalding-1830074084) to the antisemitic as hell Pittsburgh shooting, where she INSTANTLY goes after Keith Ellison again, [because apparently NRA &gt; Antisemitism and of course why not go after the other party with the ""both sides"" argument while you're at it](https://www.salon.com/2018/10/30/meghan-mccain-believes-gun-owners-are-victims-after-pittsburgh-synagogue-massacre_partner/). 

And that's not even going into her silence about shit like her father singing ""bomb bomb Iran"", or calling Vietnamese people ""Gooks"" (an INCREDIBLY offensive term mind you), or that her Father's running mate, Sarah Palin, [literally invited a VERY racist Ted Nugent to accompany her during a visit to the white house](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/20/sarah-palin-donald-trump-ted-nugent-kid-rock), who not ironically, had been forced to apologize because of a very antisemitic post by Nugent, [her only real comments on Palin](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Politics/exclusive-meghan-mccain-breaks-silence-sarah-palin/story?id=11521614) are on if she was the reason her father lost the election or not. 

I can find literally zero comments from her (or most of Ilhan's attackers) anywhere on [Rep Jim Jordan's antisemitic ""Tom $teryer""](https://twitter.com/jim_jordan/status/1102268353492721664) tweet. 

So why the tears with what Ilhan? Is it any wonder that quite a few people consider it faux outrage?

Additionally, this whole ordeal with Ilhan (Which I hope by now have at least given enough weight against the accusations), is [being heavily spun by Republicans as ""The DNC is now the party of antisemitism""](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/12/cheney-republicans-anti-semitism-vote-1216934), probably in an [attempt to win more of the Jewish vote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/12/no-president-trump-americas-jews-will-not-be-joining-you-gop/?utm_term=.e39380f15498) after their recent loses. 

In other words, it seems this entire outrage is purely driven by Partisan politics rather than a genuine concern for antisemitism. 
"
78,e038h9v,"4 things.

1.)  Most of our allies in the middle east are our friends because we pay them or trade with them.  They are not loyal to us or believe in our goals and will work against us if it benefits themselves.  For example, bin Laden hiding in Pakistan.  Israel, surrounded on all sides by enemies, needs non-arab friends and will not work at cross purposes to whatever we want to do in the middle east.

2.) Jews do not control the banks but Jewish Americans are politically active.  They make campaign contributions and help elect pro-Israel politicians.

3.) To hardcore Christians/Evangelicals, the nation state of Israel is a precondition of Jesus's return and the creation of heaven on earth.  This belief is derived from interpretations of apocalyptic texts in some of the gospels.  Many of these evangelicals are upper middle class and donate money to politicians that promote their world view.

4.) Muslims are a threat to Christians temporally and spiritually while Jews are not.  Jews do not proselytize, do not (usually) force non-Jews to abide by their religious strictures and many of their holy texts are a part of the Christian bible.  On the other hand, Muslims are inclusive.  They proselytize and seek political positions to bring society more in keeping with Islamic principles.  For example, the erosion of progressive liberties in Turkey by Erdogan and the rural, conservative Muslims that support him.  Additionally, in progressive Muslim countries, Christians that do not convert are punished monetarily.  In more conservative areas of Islamic power they may be killed.  

Most importantly, to devout Christians, the bible is the final word of God and Jesus is a divine being.  The bible provides a solution to the terrible existential crises of death by life beyond death in Heaven.  Jesus ( as a kind of god ) grants freedom from living with sin and sin's associated guilt while also being a resurrection figure that further reinforces the concept of life after death.  Muslim texts dispute these two key points and put in doubt the absolute surety of life after death.  Yes, Muslims have a concept of life after death, but the fact that their message is DIFFERENT and contains additional info beyond what is found in the bible is enough to make Christians feel threatened.  What if Christians don't have the correct interpretation?  What if the bible isn't the word of God?  What if none of it is true?  What if God isn't real?  What if we are all going to die and in 4 billion years the sun will expand and consume the earth and it will be like we never existed at all?  These are hard pills to swallow but religious people think they have the solution in their holy texts which MUST NEVER BE QUESTIONED. 

Conversely, many Christians believe that Jews are misguided and do not have the 'complete' picture when Jews do not knowledge Jesus as a divine being.  I suppose because many Jewish beliefs are incorporated within Christian texts, their disbelief in Jesus becomes palatable.  If Jews were more aggressive in their denial maybe Christians would have a problem.  

These are why America supports Israel."
79,dyyfvt4,"The vast majority of Jewish Americans are *way* less approving of aggressive Zionism than the average talking head in the Jewish community. That is, their representation is far more conservative than their actual population (and they’re not even close to as bellicose and aggressive as actual Israeli citizens, who seem to be in full lebensraum mode now. "
80,dnryd67,"&gt;You’re not “condoning it”, but saying he has a point. Same thing.

No, No I'm not supporting him.

I asked if you watched the video, because I figured you hadn't. I think both OP and hoop_stress are doing the same thing.

""A lot of Jewish men are Passive Aggressive"" is also racist.

edit: So the question is why only condemn one for racist comments? The conclusion I came to was you hadn't watched video or you don't think OP comments are racist. If you've thoroughly watched video and don't think his comments are racist then I'd sincerely like to know why (I want to grow)."
81,dkqm5sb,"I'm an israeli jew, 32 years old. Been married for 4 years. So are most of my friends.

Jewish girls, or at least Israeli jewish girls are absolutely terrible for the following reasons:

1. Ridiculously high maintenance: Constantly require support and attention. they'll whine and bully you with passive aggressive guilt trips until they'll get what they want and they'll wear you out until you are a shadow of your former self

2. Domineering and insensitive: they'll shower you everyday with an endless list of chores until you'll fall to bed too tired to even dream at night about running away from the house

3. Crushing your confidence: nothing you ever do is good enough. Literally nothing.
your hobbies are stupid and childish. you are stupid and your friends are stupid. ""Why aren't you making enough money!? You're the man, you're supposed to provide. Why aren't you helping around the house?! We're in 2017, we're supposed to be equal partners!""

4. The sex drive of a frozen mummy: once the kids pop out You're done. Thanks for the sperm, now shut up and go to bed she has work tomorrow.

5. 50% chance she'll dump you taking the kids and the house all to herself and you'll pay alimony that could be about 50% of your paycheck leaving you in some shitty cockroach infested apartment for the rest of your life.

At least they won't cheat on you for the most part. Men to them are just a disposable product. It's easier to serve in the IDF being stoned by arabs everyday and eat shitty food sleeping on some cardboard thick mattress in the middle of fuckholestan. Hell, even being in prison might be better but i'm not that desperate yet.

tl;dr: jewish women are domineering slave drivers who hate seeing a man having fun or resting."
82,dkoier8,"My religion helps me with this issue. Hinduism is one of the only religions with the message that other religions offer valid belief systems: we're worshiping the same God. Second, unlike the West, Hindus are not burdened by white guilt when it comes to Radical Islamic Terror. We've fought with radical Islamists for millenia and have a ton of experience in dealing with them. 

Take a firm stance against radical Islamic terror and Wahhabism. They will never submit or accept you if you bow down to them and silence legitimate criticism under the pretense of ""Islamophobia."" India is one of the few countries with relatively peaceful coexistence with a large Muslim population. The issue is that a very militant, jingoistic, and highly conservative faction of Muslims maintain control through fear and oppression to the point that moderates cannot even express themselves or ask for internal reform without being beaten to death, raped, or tortured. And this is coming from family members, dear friends and anyone who potentially adheres to the more violent, conservative aspects of the religion. 

Look at the attitudes of Muslims around the world. The majority wish for the death of Jewish people. Were it not for the USA's military aid and the sheer willpower of the Jewish people, Israel would not exist. All over the middle east the jews have been systematically wiped out by both Muslims and the West (Holocaust, etc). Yet despite all of this, they managed to secure Israel, the last true home of the Jewish people and maintain tremendous influence in the greatest country in the world, the USA. 

I have so much respect for the Jewish people and culturally, Hindus and Jews have many similarities. We have pride in our culture/religion, we have similar ceremonies, a different culture of food, similar coming of age ceremonies (munji vs bar mitzvah), a culture that emphasizes education above less useful pursuits to the point that Hindu Americans followed by Jewish Americans are the two most successful groups in the United States, and a similar cultural issue that we've been dealing with for millenia, Radical Islamic Terror.

The countries with majority Hindu/Jew population respectively have peaceful relations within our respective countries with large Muslim populations (perhaps Israel not so much) and do understand the need for acceptance of the moderate, peaceful Muslims but we've had 1000s of years of experience in dealing with the core issues. 

Yet Hindus also work very closely with Muslims. In America, your religion does not matter. Very few Muslims in the USA are radicalized and the majority of Hindus support religious freedom and Muslim Americans because we're stereotyped as them all the time and we support other minorities. Yes, there are more nationalistic Hindus/Jews that maintain aggressive stances against Muslims, but the majority share the common perspective for the betterment of society. 

The issue with Israel is that the Palestinians were there first. Second, the Israeli people will NEVER give up Israel and are far too powerful to lose control to the point that they form a new country. It's a naive, pipe dream that will never bear fruition until the USA steps in (which it won't as the strongest lobby is pro-Zionism). Democrats are currently on a crusade of Islamic Apologism and are failing miserably to convince the majority of Americans (60+ support the travel ban including many Dems). 

So the two state solution isn't going to happen while Netanyahu is alive. Peace may come about after new leadership takes place, but at this point the Palestinian people are slowly being eradicated and it's heartbreaking to watch. 

Academia is considerably appalled by the events and supports Palestine for the most part, but nobody can do anything because foreign policy is a different beast and Israel/US alliance is too important/powerful. It's the same reason we don't ackowledge the Armenian Genocide or the existence of Taiwan as a state. 

Doing the right thing comes at tremendous political cost. National security and the rights/lives of citizens takes precedence over doing the morally correct thing. States are not moral agents."
83,fxp2s1j,"I'm a leftist (socialist) and I use ""Real Americans"" rhetoric.

Black Americans are Real Americans; they built this country, and without their contributions to music and poetry we would probably still be a cultural backwater. Jewish Americans are Real Americans; some of our best scientists, writers, and entertainers were Jewish refugees from a sickening Europe. Latino Americans are Real Americans, too, and so are Asian and African immigrants. Equally Real are mixed-European (""white"") Americans like me. My ancestry is a mix of English, Irish, Alsatian, Sicilian, German, and Ashkenazi... but me, personally? I'm a mix, a midwestern mutt, and I have exactly one nationality: American. And while the politics of this country infuriates me— and much of our history turns my stomach— I love the place and I'll fight for it.

You know who's not real Americans? The global corporate elite. Davos Men. The 0.01-percenters who don't give a shit what happens to this country— the ones who are fine with a GOP that stokes racial divisions if it means they pay less in taxes. They contribute nothing and we'd be better off without them.

Trump is not a real American. He's a parasitic sack of garbage imposed on us by the global Capitalist Party. He hates this country and I hope that in November we give him the rejection he deserves."
84,fxq9f2s,"Because Nigerian Americans are recent immigrants who face a set of challenges which are different from other groups of black people in this country. In many cases, wealthy and educated Nigerians immigrate to the US for education here or for other reasons. These people were highly privileged in their country of origin and retain some socioeconomic privileges in the US. Furthermore, their accents and culture are sometimes apparent and differentiates them from stereotypes about African Americans.

Asian Americans which you cited previously are also often immigrants or children of immigrants who are self-selected. They benefit in some cases from the ""model minority"" stereotype and receive trust and approval in areas in which black people don't. Whose application do you think is more likely to be considered for grad school or a lucrative job: ""Yuanyuan Yeng"" or ""Jamal Jackson""? 

Jewish Americans are either white or white-passing, depending on who you ask, and face issues so completely different from black peoples' that we actually have two totally different words to describe the oppression each faces--racism and anti-Semitism.

Finally, culture as you call it is informed by how others treat us. Your attitudes toward teachers, black people, cashiers, postal workers, white people, Christians, Buddhists, and even cats and dogs is informed by how they interact with you. And even the ways in which you act in some situations without those groups around can be affected by how you have been treated by them.

Is it any surprise that Nigerian Americans who grew up having rarely been oppressed due to their race have less racial trauma, distrust, and imposter syndrome-type feelings than Black people who grew up in America? Is it any surprise that it is easier to grow up and be successful if you are from a country in which you have never been segregated in a classroom/school due to the color of your skin?

Does growing up without a father because he is in prison for possession of marijuana count as culture? Does it count as culture when Black people go to a different church than white people, because historically your ancestors always went to different churches because enslaved Black people were not allowed to learn about ""real"" Christianity?

Does it count as culture when that Nigerian immigrant may be able to trace his family's history back to 1400 in that same part of the country, but many Black people whose ancestors were enslaved have no idea where their last names came from?

Does it count as culture when one of my black friends told me they identify with Wakanda because they literally don't know what country(ies) their ancestors were stolen from?

Is it culture, or is ""race"" the word you were looking for?

The cards are always stacked against people who play cards. That's what gambling IS. That's what that metaphor refers to. The house always wins overall. But sometimes, a few people get lucky and beat the house for a game or two. Does that make it a fair game?"

86,fv8jg17,"No my reason for pointing that out was to highlight the fact that there are more than one factor that go into every statistic, this is something that the current state of race obsessed leftists (i'm a left leaning centrist) cannot seem to wrap their heads around: Lurking Variables/Factors.

Imagine if a vet looked at things this way. He saw some new disease that effected only cats and said ""hey! Every animal that has this disease is a mammal, all mammals must be equally likely to get this disease!"" Without considering the fact that all cats are mammals, but not all mammals are cats.

Thats a simple example of course but it holds up. In short the reason asian americans earn more and do better is simple: Many asian americans are first-generation immigrants, meaning only the cream of the crop was given work visas to come to the US, and rich people hold their kids to higher standards and have better resources. Simple as that. *The point is it's due to indirect factors, not direct factors such as ""let's give asians more money"".*

There are endless examples of this: Women are overrepresented in education/psychology positions, black men are overrepresented in sports/media/music, asians are underrepresented in music and media, jewish americans are overrepresented as lawyers, etc. etc. etc.

The reason black americans do poorly is of course due to residual effects of slavery/jim crow. When equal rights were obtained some managed to make it out of the poverty cycle, many did not(which I don't look down on them for by any means). The same goes for most poor people of any race, you can trace their ills back generations. But to blame all of the ills of black americans on *current* systemic racism is to **ignore the true nature of the problem**, and is thus no different than banging your head on a brick wall instead of trying climb over it."

2) France (and Europe) has a completely different system of racial identity. Your immigrants from African colonies are mostly from the post-colonial era and therefore there origins are clearer. They could be Cameroonian and French, this also has roots in the late colonial period where colonial citizens were encouraged to think of themselves as French. America has a large number of blacks who have a loose understanding of their ethnic identity having come from a myriad of different areas in Africa and being here for hundreds of years which resulted in a truly distinct ethnic group. Outside of that specific issue, no one in America is ""American"" in the same way that a Frenchman who has had roots in Normandy for hundreds of years is ""French"".

I used my toys on her for a while, escalated to using erotic massage techniques during foreplay, and I practiced your oral instructions on her until I fully adapted the methodology on her.

I feel like Jewish girls talk too much in general, and I don't know if that'd extend to bed. I appreciate a gently moaning, otherwise silent, lover.

She would have to not be very intelligent, tbh. Most Jewish girls are tricked into Zionism by pathos they learn on Birthright and/or their family. Two-staters usually don't want Palestine to have a military(which would be a major legitimate institution primarily attracting young radicals away from terrorist groups, so that's a dumb idea) nor really any significant housing rights...

Fronting polemic aside, I really only hate Zionists, because I hate people like my dad, who turn themselves into martyrs to justify causing harm. The ghettos of Warsaw don't justify the ghettos of Palestine. I have no end of sad immigrant stories from my parents and their friends, and my compassion fatigue is through the roof. If you don't even have trauma and you're bargaining with other people's sorrow to get prime real estate...

in terms of culture, american was a land of social opportunity. while some felt comfortable living in their own bubble, others wanted to assimilate better into american culture. that would mean trying new things, eating at different restaurants.  many jews felt safer eating in chinese restaurants because chinese food was a safer treyf alternative to italian and other wasp (white anglo saxon protestant) cuisine as it didn't contain dairy, and any pork in the dish would have been finely minced and hidden; also chop suey was the rage back then, if you wanted to be seen as more worldly and cosmopolitan, and less living in a shetl, you would go likely eat at a chinese restaurant.   also chinese restaurants were open on christmas when most restaurants were closed.

social justice is an issue for all, and jewish americans are more together on issues like this as they are more discussed and willing to take action than some christian churches which contain more liberals than radicals.  when black lives matter was a more genuine thing a few years ago, i witnessed a middle of the road jewish congregation in the upper west side to blockade broadway in the evening. 
https://www.westsiderag.com/2014/12/05/rabbis-jewish-activists-arrested-after-blocking-96th-and-broadway
it was the first time many of the people in that congregation had protested in this way, but it was a learning experience for some, and many were willing to get arrested (their first time protesting and getting arrested) because it was a social justice issue.    you wouldn't see this done with a christian church unless it was a huge production."

And then obviously the Muslim and Jewish men are for religious reasons. I'd say it's about 70% not and 30% circumcised."
93,ff7hzfe,"Ok a lot to unpack here. Let's take it one thing at a time.

&gt;There is an ever-present demographic fear many White conservatives have that the USA will lose its White majority

This isn't solely due to Hispanic migration but yes the White Majority is hanging on by a thread and it's not likely to last another 100 years, if that.

&gt;and then the country will suffer due to this fact.

This is sort of a separate topic. I will say that as America loses it's White Majority it is losing it's identity. We are no longer the cousins of England and the sons of the Revolution. The Boston Tea Party and Lewis and Clark's expedition mean nothing to Hispanic immigrants which is why we see monuments and statues defaced on a yearly basis now.

&gt;The main source of this demographic change is the fact that Hispanics/Latino population in the USA is exponentially growing. They were 2% of the US population in 1960 and 20% in 2020. If their birth rates and migration rates continue, Hispanics will be a very large share of the U.S. population and non-Hispanic Whites will no longer be the ethnic majority of the USA.Note however that I didn't say that ""White Americans"" wouldn't stop being a majority in the USA. ""Non-Hispanic Whites"" would. White Americans will still remain the demographic racial majority of the USA for a long time even if Hispanic birth rates and immigration rates keep rising (they aren't).

As we all know demographic trends do not remain steady. The difference though is not in the birth rates but the immigration. Legal and illegal immigration is bringing in over a million people per year. It's not even about the birth rates, which do slow down over time. But not if you keep bringing new immigrants with high fertility in. Then it never stops.

&gt;The majority of Hispanics and Latinos in the United States identify as White.

They shouldn't. They are, by and large, Amerindians mixed with Spaniards. That's mixed race not white.

&gt;Most Hispanics are also predominately European on average meaning mixed Hispanic children will almost certainly be White passing.

Disagreed. I live in Southern California and am more than familiar with how Hispanics look and who passes for White. In my experience your average Hispanic does not pass for white even when they are paler than other Hispanics. When a pale Hispanic has children with a White it seems to me there is something like a 1 in 4 chance for that child to be pale enough to pass for White at a glance. It's not common though.

&gt;Hispanic Americans have very high intermarriage rates with White Americans. The two most common interracial marriage couples in the USA are White Man + Hispanic Women and Hispanic Man + White Woman

A) Interracial relationships are very rare in the first place.

B) What does this have to do with immigration and racial majorities?

&gt;Mixed Hispanics are less likely to identify as Hispanic anymore after several generations.

You know...I think you should know we are not big on how people ""identify"" around here. You are what you are not how you identify.

&gt;After three generations. Hispanics overwhelmingly speak English and cannot even speak Spanish fluently anymore.

They don't speak fluently as first generation. Their parents don't teach them. Only enough to tell them what to do as kids like go to the bathroom. Hispanic kids brought to or born in America are at a huge disadvantage with language. Regardless though, even if what you are saying is absolutely true, what does this have to do with immigration and racial majorities? Are you trying to say that because they speak English and not Spanish then they are just as American as anyone else or what? I can go to Japan and speak Japanese all I want, I will never be Japanese.

&gt;Despite Trump targeting Mexican immigrants, a sizable percentage of Hispanics are still Republican.

No they aren't. This is a lie.

&gt;Despite Donald Trump being pro-Israel and anti-Hispanic, White, Black, and even Jewish Americans are more likely to be a victim of a hate crime than Latino Americans are.

Hate crimes aren't a real thing. Next.

&gt;There is historical precedence of an immigrant minority being persecuted (Irish, Italians, etc.) before fully assimilating into the White American identity.

I would argue they were never fully assimilated. They assimilated better because of shared culture and identity but it never fully took.

&gt;Hispanic Americans have high rates of interaction with non-Hispanics and are less segregated than other minorities.

I don't even know what this means. Like monetary interaction? What does this have to do with immigration?!

&gt;There are already Latino neighborhoods with similar median incomes to White American neighborhoods.

Sure, when you have 4 people in a household working under the table not declaring taxes, get welfare for food rent and utilities, and money for kids. Yeah a lot of brand new immigrants that come with nothing can live an upper middle class life style here. Especially in big welfare cities like Los Angeles.

&gt;Now Whiteness includes not only all Europeans but even non-European regions of North Africa and the Middle East.

Nope.

&gt;If you only consider White Anglo-Saxon Protestants to be ""real White people"" than the USA stopped being majority-White all the way back in the late 1950s.

A) Yeah, more or less it did.

B) WASPs are not the only white people but white certainly does not extend to Mestizos, Africans, and Arabs."

I'm just saying that white, American Jews are apart of the ""in group"" now and I doubt we will see any systematic oppression of them in the US. The history of the Holocaust is too strong and it's much more likely that Muslims or immigrants from South America would get the brunt of any fascist uprising in the US"
96,eu442nu,"Again, why is that a good argument? Spouting white chauvinist propaganda isn't a substitute for a real argument. But let me humor you.

There are plenty of reasons why. This includes everything from the genocidal destruction of their homelands to falling for western propaganda. The immigrant groups you mention are usually the elite of their society but strangely they don't report the west as the utopia you state once they get here. Asian and African immigrant groups constantly report experiencing white supremacist racism. And Jewish Americans are predominantly white Ashkenazi so benefit from white supremacy.

We need to look  at the experiences of the oldest racial minorities to understand the true nature of white supremacy. These are groups like Amerindians, African Americans, Inuit Romani,  Australasian Aboriginals etc. And they all appear to be strong critics of your triumphalist western supremacy. They describe your civilization as hypocritical racist garbage. How telling.

Yes, we know how the US pumped money into Japan and Korea to stop them from detecting to the Soviets. This was important to white imperialists as these countries were within the Soviet sphere of influence and the white imperialist believed in the ""domino theory"".

I already explained why systematic supremacy has become coded and covert since the cold war. The basic realities of life in the west of communities of color indicate white supremacy has never been more alive and well in the US.

And with the Trump and co. open white supremacy is being rehabilitated into the mainstream again.

I don't need to provide any laws. I can only point you to [life of African Americans as evidence of systematic racism](https://i.imgur.com/Ehnriwq.jpg)."
97,euhrm07,"Society is becoming less judgmental, but employers are becoming more draconian. An individual human being recognizes that someone who said something stupid 15 years ago doesn't deserve to have it ruin his life. Employers, on the other hand, are looking for any reason at all to reject someone who's not an executive's kid.

Our world is increasingly run by malignant, mostly private, bureaucracies operated by people with no autonomy that execute decisions no one (save the inaccessibly wealthy) wants.

The people who live in this country are moving to the left, and toward social-libertarian, live-and-let-live attitudes. The people who run the country, however, are moving to the right and toward authoritarianism, at least in workplace and economic affairs. (I don't think the lizard-people/0.1-percenters actually care about race or religion either way.)

One thing I'd like to do is take back ""Real Americans"" from the right. Black people are real Americans (some of them have been here since the 17th century). Immigrants are real Americans (this is a nation of immigrants). Jewish Americans are real Americans, so are Muslim Americans. Who's not real Americans? The 0.1-percenters who don't give a shit about the place because they'll move their capital (the only fucking thing they care about) elsewhere if it suits them."
98,ej6bse9,"I don't think anyone is looking overly racist here.  I think the question becomes ""how much is acceptable before it sort of reflects racism""?  I was just reading an article about how the Southern Poverty Law Center is a racist hypocrisy, basically.  The idea being that it was pretty much run by money grubbing white men, who only wanted money and power and don't actually believe in the virtue of the Center's origin.  The writer was speaking broadly about a number of Jewish lawyers who held all the power and made up the leadership, so there was no diversity at the top.  Regardless, it sounds like a shitty situation.  But I bring it up, because its the kind of argument that is often heard today.  ""White men are a problem"" and they have all the power and they prey on everyone else and they feed off toxic masculinity.  But, if you just narrow that statement down to ""Jewish men are the problem"" and you turn ""toxic masculinity"" into ""toxic hebrewism"" or something, now we immediately have something that is blatantly anti-semetic.  Something about using a broad stroke makes it completely ok.  I know it's challenging for me (white guy) because I read an article like that, and I'm like ""wow those guys are assholes"", but I am constantly hearing how a group that I am in is power hungry and toxic.  The reason I try to avoid getting overly defensive about it, is because I'm conscious of the fact that in an EXTREMELY general sense, white men have done a bunch of horrible things when put into power, many times for the benefit of white people only.  But realistically, I'm  from a family that is a few generations from Irish (caught a fair amount of shit when getting here, many as true immigrants, some as indentured servants that were forced into contracts because they were starving) and Italian (The original immigrants who were harassed for not speaking the language and all being tied to a large crime organization) immigrants, who were just looking for an exciting, better life.

**American Jews**

American Jews, or Jewish Americans, are Americans who are Jews, whether by religion, ethnicity or nationality. The current Jewish community in the United States consists primarily of Ashkenazi Jews, who descend from diaspora Jewish populations of Central and Eastern Europe and comprise about 90-95% of the American Jewish population. Most American Ashkenazim are US-born, with a dwindling number of now elderly earlier immigrants, as well as some more recent foreign-born immigrants.

During the colonial era, prior to the mass immigration of Ashkenazim, Spanish and Portuguese Jews represented the bulk of America's then small Jewish population, and while their descendants are a minority today, they along with an array of other Jewish communities represented the remainder of American Jews, including other more recent Sephardic Jews, Mizrahi Jews, various other ethnically Jewish communities, as well as a smaller number of converts to Judaism.

101,egnv3bi,"Just replace 'Jewish' with 'Jewish-American' and you're pretty much spot on.

The Jewish-American community is generally educated, (sub)urban and middleclass. So a lot of Jewish-Americans are born and raised in precisely the kind of social environment that also produces the bulk of the college liberals.

That's the most important aspect here - Jewish-American individuals like Michelle Goldberg here are spouting blatantly anti-white racism because they're American leftists anno 2019. The fact that they're Jewish in some way doesn't really have much to do with that, because there's also plenty of regular self-hating whites who are spouting equally vicious anti-white, anti-cishet, etc. bullshit. The causative agent and common denominator here is modern leftwing ideology.

Note that European Jews tend to be different in this regard. There's still plenty of pozzed types among them as well, but European Jews in general tend to be more quiet about politics. (and considering that leftwing and neoliberal policies like ""let's all have mass Muslim immigration"" and ""brown immigrants can do no wrong and anyone who says otherwise is an evil nazi racist"" have caused antisemitism to skyrocket, well... let's just say that it's no surprise that more and more European Jews are getting disillusioned with liberal and leftwing social policies)"
102,eewb5t9,"Way too many studies to narrow it down.  
I'm centring on Black/White differences as it's what this discussion is about.  
And as I said above, it's mainly American studies, not African ones as the are so few.
Up until the last two decades this was a fairly common study in America.  
There are way too many to formulate an exact number.  
On average the figure often quoted is that there is a difference of 1.1 SD (standard deviations).  
This would equate to an IQ difference of 15-18 points.  
However a lot of these studies were carried out during segregation, when black children had almost no education by comparison, and the testing methods were less than fair.  
After segregation there was a clear indication that the average Black IQ in America was increasing, again leaning credence to the notion that it is environmental not genetic.  
Jewish Americans are the perfect example of this.  
In the 1940's on average Jewish students tested lower than Caucasian students by about 10 IQ points.  
At the time Jewish Americans were on average way poorer than the average white American.  
Nowadays they test almost 10 IQ points higher, implying that the improvement in their environment helped them score better, and that it wasn't a genetic issue.  
Back to Black/White American differences.  
Now there are no real current studies due to the fear of racism.  
But going off American SAT scores for instance the average Black student tends to score about 5-10% worse than the average White student.  
This is by no means exact however as on average more black children drop out of school for instance, and have a way worse quality of school on average due to being poor, and other societal issues.  
  
Again this is tertiary at best to the issue in Ireland as we have African immigrants from multiple ethnicities, and very few of them African American.  
  
The most important factor I can show is the Flynn Effect.  
I'm not going to go into it in great detail now, but it basically shows that both fluid and crystalized IQ scores across the world are increasing.  
Basically as countries get richer, and education standards increase, IQ does also.  
This has been shown with multiple ethnicities over decades now.  
So even if Sub Saharan Africans right now have a lower IQ, which there is some evidence suggesting, then if given the same standards of education as we have in Ireland, every subsequent generation would see an increase in IQ until they balance out.  
As long as their culture is the same of course.  
If they don't join Irish culture there will always outside issues that effect IQ.  "

Your statement that America doesn’t have significant populations of refugees is obviously false. 5,000 Doukhobors from Russia is a good example to contrast to your comment on a small group of people from the Caucasus region. Cubans in Miami are another example of America helping refugees up until recently (thanks Obama).

America is only 60% non-Hispanic white and that number is alarmingly decreasing.

....

Every point you made is completely out of touch with reality and if you had any sort of diversity at all you would see that minorities **self**-segregate to retain their culture and out of a desire for the familiar.

The fact that everyone in Israel blends together as a homogeneous society shows how little diversity you have. You defeated your own argument.

The current Jewish community in the United States consists primarily of Ashkenazi Jews, who descend from diaspora Jewish populations of Central/Eastern Europe and comprise about 90% of the American Jewish population. Most American Ashkenazim are US-born, with a dwindling number of now elderly earlier immigrants, as well as some more recent foreign-born immigrants. 

During the colonial era, prior to the mass immigration of Ashkenazim, Spanish and Portuguese Jews represented the bulk of America's then small Jewish population, and while their descendants are a minority today, they along with an array of other Jewish communities represented the remainder of American Jews, including other more recent Sephardic Jews, Mizrahi Jews, various other ethnically Jewish communities, as well as a smaller number of converts to Judaism.

110,dwlzcd6,"I don't agree at all. Asian-Americans are hugely underrepresented in crime statistics, and immigrants from East Asia are, on average, less prone to crime almost everywhere they go. Similarly, Jewish-Americans are underrepresented in crime.

The reality is that blacks are (warning: blasphemy incoming), on average *genetically more prone to violence, stupidity, and the criminality concomitant with those two traits.*

Blacks have, on average, higher testosterone levels than whites. Among whites only, having higher testosterone levels is a decent predictor of reckless behavior, including criminality. 

Blacks in the US, have a mean IQ of 85. IQ is between 60-80% hereditary. IQ tests are not culturally biased, at least not according to the American Psychological Association. In fact, tests which deal with more abstract problems (ie find the shape the shape that fits this pattern) show a *starker* IQ difference than tests which are less abstract (ie what word would complete this sentence).

For a more thorough overview, I recommend reading A Troublesome Inheritance, by former NYTimes science editor Nicholas Wade.

If you thought ""what a bunch of racist pseudoscience"", what pseudoscience did I present? Science shows that races (as is generally understood) are a perfectly valid category, and races differ biologically in any number of ways. If skin color could evolve separately over time, why couldn't the brain?"
111,dwyk266,"&gt; You’re aware of the irony that you immediately associate common black names with being “trashy” and white names as “normal” right? For the purposes of your study with better methodology what names would you choose that are both indicative of a high chance of being black and not “trashy”?

I didn't. I posited that they used trashy black names and if they had used trashy white names there would have been similar outcomes. Trashy white names exist too. Saying the phrase ""trashy black names"" doesn't mean ""traditional black names are trashy."" Don't twist my words. I would choose Nia, Deja, Kiara, Darnell, Demetrius, Terrance, Daryl, Andre and most traditionally African names, too. There are names that sound like an average person whose parents considered that their children would need to be taken seriously when naming them. Also, you still need to look at whose hiring and whether using trashy white names would result in similar outcome.

&gt; And yes, if a number of organizations are discriminatory towards black people thats literally the definition of systemic racism. Systemic racism doesn’t just mean that the government is racist.

Yeah, in an individual system, and it is illegal to do so and they can be brought to court. It is not indicative of most systems being racist, or there being some overarching theme of racism. it is indicative of that specific system being racist and we need to condemn systems as individual systems. When most people talk about systemic racism, they are being vague because they don't actually know of any racist systems that they can point to and it's easier to push a narrative about grand oppression based on ambiguity.

&gt; Nigerians are also definitely not in general making more money than white people; there could be a few highly rich immigrants to the US combined with overall low population of Nigerian immigrants screwing figures, not even sure if that’s true and not going to look it up, but even then that wouldn’t be significant, and also isn’t indicative of lack of systemic racism, as black people are definitely not categorized functionally in the US by their actual country of origin. No racist has ever said “all blacks are bad, except the Senegalese, they’re chill”

It's literally on Wikipedia. And most of the highest earning ethnic groups are not white. The same proportion of rich outliers screw the statistics up for white people as for Nigerias. For example, Jewish Americans are counted as white and they average 97,000 a year, way above the white average, and white supremacists do not consider them white. That's just how a bell curve works. That is exactly my point, certain groups of black people do well in this country because there is no overarching systemic racism, otherwise they would all do equally as poorly and there wouldn't be as many successful black people. 

Question: what do you even mean when you say systemic racism? 
And do you think that any of the disparity between outcomes of racial groups is due to the choices of individuals who happen to be of certain races?"
112,dukwgr8,"My apologies if that sounded pretentious.

Religion may not have been a part of it for you, but religion *is* why the custom originated. Saying it *was* religious - well, it still is for some, because I think Jewish boys are supposed to have it done. But yes for others its not about religion any more, but about custom. 

Growing up in Australia we knew only one boy who was uncut - an immigrant from Germany - and we thought he looked weird.

Still though change has to come sometime.  I'm in a country now where not all boys are cut automatically (In fact I'm not sure what the percentage is in China) so we decided to let him go natural. He can always cut later if he wants.

He's 9yo now, one small infection when he was maybe 3 i think (not sure) that lasted a week  and he's had no problems ever since.

I think the problems are overstated. For example, not all countries *do* circumcise the majority, yet they don't seem to be having problems.

It was just a cultural and religious hangover. One day it'll be the boys who are cut who look weird.

"
113,dsj7egq,"&gt; permanent underclass

So, this is the only truly fucked up thing you've said. I realize that illegal immigrants may not be Bill Gates or Warren Buffet in a single generation, but you have to recognize Irish, Jewish, Italian, Chinese, etc. immigrants started out the *exact* same way. The vast majority came with nothing and started in minimum wage (or lower) jobs. They've all been exploited at some point, but none of them are considered an underclass today. Many Mexicans may be poorer than average today, but that won't be the case forever. As a disclaimer I may be speaking purely from my own experience. My wife's family came here from Mexico. My wife was actually born 2 months after her mom crossed the border illegally, and they were illegal until her dad was able to get his green card. She's a mechanical engineer. Her sister is one semester from a B.S in Chemistry, she's set to graduate with honors and she's applying to grad school. Two of her cousins have computer science degrees, and I'm not talking about I.T., they write legit programs and apps that get distributed to the public, they make more than I do, and I'm also an engineer. I'm responding to you specifically because a lot of stuff you've said is pretty moderate, and I agree with a good chunk of it, but this shit I had to address right off the bat. It's borderline racist, and to me it seems to be the cornerstone of most arguments against even the most moderate amnesty. Mexicans only work as farm workers, lawncare maintenance, maids, and nannies because they don't have the opportunity to do other things *right now*. Supporting immigrants may be an investment for the country, but it's literally *never* been a bad investment in the long run. There's no reason to think Mexicans will be any different, other than the fact that those who are here illegally don't have the opportunities that the first Italian, Irish, or Jewish immigrants had, and that's a low bar in and of itself.

&gt; - discourage future illegal immigration

&gt; - We want immigrants properly scrutinized

&gt; - We can fix immigration and make it easier for people to come here, from Central American and everywhere else in the world, but we can't do that while people illegally stream across the border.

Agreed on on the first 2 points, but I just want to point out that if it were easier for people to come into the country legally then immigrants would be properly scrutinized, we would better know who's in the country and who isn't, and the people living here would have protections that illegal immigrants don't currently have. Also, the number of people coming in illegally would decrease dramatically and it would be easier for border security to focus on drug traffickers and cartels crossing the border.

&gt; We want an end to chain migration

I'm not sure if you're aware, but chain migration is actually a tactic of *legal* migration more so than illegal migration. In order to get a green card you have to be sponsored by a workplace, or a close family member. The reason many people cross the border illegally is because they don't already have any friends or family to sponsor them. So an end to chain migration would actually lead to more illegal migration.

&gt; We want immigrants to assimilate.

I'm not sure what level of assimilation you want, but very few immigrant groups have ever assimilated beyond learning English (and that didn't happen overnight). For the most part Italian-Americans are still very proudly Italian. Jewish-Americans are devoutly Jewish. They both still have their own culture separate from that of non-Italians, or non-Jewish Americans nearly 100 years after coming to America. Mexican people are *never* going to be Ward and June Cleaver. They'll always be proudly Mexican-American, like everyone else.

Also, as a side note, if you are simply talking about speaking English it would be much easier for illegal immigrants to work on their English if they could get legal jobs. If you're working an illegal job, you're surrounded by other illegal immigrants that probably don't speak English very well either.

&gt; exploit them with cheap wages

Right now they're unprotected by minimum wage laws. Anyone who is being honest with themselves knows that the only reason Republicans/the right haven't actually done much about illegal immigration is because their campaigns are paid for in part by large farm groups like the Koch Brothers that rely on the ability to pay farm workers less than minimum wage.

&gt;the only reason democrats/the left want unchecked illegal immigration is that they believe it will one day give them an electoral majority.

Yes. Politicians are selfish bastards. If anyone thinks Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer are going to save them because they genuinely care about their well being, then they're an idiot, but that's the point of politics in general. ""Hey, senator, if you care about this thing this group cares about you're going to be very popular and win several votes."" Republicans have had a chance to win the votes of immigrants, it's not like immigrants and minorities lean democrat for no reason whatsoever. Democrats have appealed to minorities since at least the 60s by supporting various civil rights movements. In fact, after Mitt Romney lost in 2012 the RNC decided that they were going to put immigration rhetoric on the back burner (or at least rephrase the conversation) and focus on pulling minorities into the party. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are both Cuban. Ben Carson is black. They were all supported early on by the RNC. That wasn't an accident or coincidence. So Democrats aren't the only ones that want the votes of immigrants or minorities, they just happen to be in the lead by a significant margin, because they have a head start of 50+ years. I actually still think it's possible for the RNC to go after 2nd and 3rd generation Mexican immigrants, but they have to start *strongly* denouncing comments like ""They aren't send their best, they're sending rapists and murders""

But, getting back to the point, those are politicians. That doesn't speak to the motivations of actual voters. There are a significant number of voters on the left that do genuinely want illegal immigrants to not be afraid to go to the hospital if they have a stroke, or call the police if they've been robbed, or simply get a library card, or a home loan, or $7.25 an hour. DACA wasn't perfect, but it helped at least a few of those people, and it seems unlikely republican congressmen will pass any sort of law that protects people that are already here illegally (because it won't win them many votes, and will lose them lots of money, not because of ideology). And because of that voters on the left are going to be upset if senators on the left provide money for a wall without some sort of assurance of protection for those people. And so we end up in a gridlock.

All in all I think I agree with many of your major points. I don't mind something like DACA being added to increased border spending. But we do need assurance that something like DACA will go through. The status quo is bad for everyone, but I think we differ on how to change it to help everyone. We also have to stop cartels from crossing the border, and that's a whole separate conversation that admittedly the left does conveniently forget to mention when the point of border security comes up. It would be helpful if we could get Mexico to help with that, but that bridge has been incinerated until the next president comes along. 

And, going back to my first point, I don't think you're racist for saying what you did. I realize that generational poverty is a real issue in this country, probably more now than it's ever been, and I'm sure that's what you meant to reference, but to say that Mexicans are bound to be a permanent underclass isn't just ""politically incorrect"" it has a very real undertone of racism to it. And in regards to generational poverty, that rubberband is bound to snap in the next decade or so. You can't have a functional country without a middle class. But that's a totally different conversation.

Sorry for the wall of text, you put a lot of thought into your comment, and seem like someone that may actually read my comment and contemplate on it."

117,do1lfe6,"Let's be frank here. The race card helped the Jews. The majority of Jewish-Americans are descended from Eastern European, who *ethnically* were Jewish but race-wise were heavily mixed with European with some even being majority European-blooded. Just look at Amy Chua's own husband who is a Jew with blonde hair with blue eyes. The majority share phenotypes features with Europeans and pass off as pure White.  When they arrived in the late 1800s, they were classified as White and didn't suffer the badges of segregation that other non-White immigrants did. I'm sure they suffered discrimination, but if many of them didn't tell you they were Jewish, you'd think they were just regular White Americans. They could easily conceal their ""Jewishness"" to avert discrimination, not something the early Chinese, Mexicans, and African-Americans could do. "

&gt; White privilege is ugly buzzword that is not real.Hindus and Jews are the richest ethno-religious groups.




Then why dont they (unless they do) have a disproportionate representation in politics, CEOs, governance, etc?  Also, Im pretty sure most Jewish Americans are white.


&gt;Also Nigerian Americans highly outperform African-Americans.



Given that a large amount of immigrants tend to be fairly well educated and driven with a purpose to do something in their host country (and pass that attitude to children) thats not exactly surprising.

Do you feel that both sides of the political spectrum, as well as the issue, are being manipulated? I agree with your points concerning the Syrian Civil War, but the liberal, ""tolerant"" side has also engaged in manipulation and deception, I feel. I mean, Germany refused to admit that there were a surge of rapes until the Cologne incident. And like I've said before, why doesn't Sweden release demographic information on the rapists? Why did they prevent it from happening in legislature? Jewish girls are being raped in Malmo by Muslim immigrants all the time; Jewish families now have to leave the city due to the rampant antisemitism from the Muslim immigrants. There have been real victims due to these immigrants, and the Swedish government doesn't care, because they want to ""be nice"". Well, the fact is that they can't afford to be nice anymore."
120,dhex3aw,"&gt; but the liberal, ""tolerant"" side has also engaged in manipulation and deception, 

Examples?

&gt;Germany refused to admit that there were a surge of rapes until the Cologne incident. And like I've said before, why doesn't Sweden release demographic information on the rapists? Why did they prevent it from happening in legislature?

Because it is discriminatory. A crime is a crime. It might even be good if they did release the data but I think that has got to do with anti discrimination laws in Europe. The reality is that rapes have not increased by much since the refugees came into the country, I showed you the data. It's around the same number, even slightly reduced. Have refugees raped? Sure. Have they committed crimes? Sure. Some refugees are even bona fide terrorist, they have been identified thru photographs, those people should be deported, jailed even. But the there hasn't been a major increase in rapes due to immigrants, that is a lie the media is telling you.

&gt;Jewish girls are being raped in Malmo by Muslim immigrants all the time

All the time? Evidence? And they haven't reported this constant rape because? The Jewish media is extremely influential. You wouldn't stop hearing about it if it were true.

&gt;Jewish families now have to leave the city due to the rampant antisemitism from the Muslim immigrants.

Recent claims of antisemitism are almost always exaggerated. People move out of the country all the time for whatever reason. zionist Israel brutalizes Palestinians on the daily, why don't you protest that?

&gt;Swedish government doesn't care, because they want to ""be nice"". Well, the fact is that they can't afford to be nice anymore.

Why can't they be whatever they want to be? You don't speak for the Swedes, let them decide what they would like to do with their own country. The refugee crisis is an issue that Europeans will have to deal with themselves. You shouldn't get involved, especially not if you are going to promote a rape narrative that I have shown to be not true. It's merely a fabrication by the media like many other things.

Are you still intending on joining an anti rape coalition?

"
121,fv1p93t,"&gt;As an example of the latter problem, consider the proportion of black  incarcerated Americans. This proportion is often used to characterize  the criminal justice system as anti-black. However, if we use the  precise same methodology, we would have to conclude that the criminal  justice system is even more anti-male than it is anti-black.  
&gt;  
&gt;Would we characterize criminal justice as a systemically misandrist conspiracy against innocent American men?

Isn't the system biased against men, given how women are treated when it comes to violent crime, domestic violence, rape, child abuse, divorce, and child custody?

Most of the points this letter raises are flawed if you think about it.

Edit: I'll bring up another to show you what I mean.

&gt;If we claim that the criminal justice system is white-supremacist, why  is it that Asian Americans, Indian Americans, and Nigerian Americans are  incarcerated at vastly lower rates than white Americans? This is a  funny sort of white supremacy. Even Jewish Americans are incarcerated  less than gentile whites. I think it’s fair to say that your average  white supremacist disapproves of Jews. And yet, these alleged white  supremacists incarcerate gentiles at vastly higher rates than Jews.

The question I have is why they would expect everyone to be treated the same way. There are specific concerns for different groups: historically, there was great fear of slave revolts like [Nat Turner's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Turner%27s_slave_rebellion) before the Civil War, and afterwards, of race riots. So it makes sense that blacks would be policed more heavily.

With regards, to, say, the Chinese, for instance, the concern was to keep them out of the country and prevent them from taking root or having Chinese women so they could settle down and start families. As a result, Chinatowns had plenty of crime: [gangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tong_Wars), [drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_den), and [prostitution](https://www.americanhistoryusa.com/chinatown-sex-slaves-human-trafficking-san-francisco-history/) off the top of my head.

The [Chinese Exclusion Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act) wasn't repealed until 1943, when China became an US ally against Japan. Even then, there was still a strict quota on Chinese immigration of 105; large scale Chinese immigration didn't occur until the [Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965)."
122,frogdvx,"Four out of the five last data points suggest Trump did well among Jewish conservatives. One exception (which I could just as easily explain away with something like ‘a huge chunk of Jewish Americans are New Yorkers or have connections to the New York metro area, and New Yorkers overwhelmingly dislike Donald Trump’) doesn’t change that - it’s not grasping at straws at all. There is zero indication that Jewish cons specifically dislike Trump more than most other recent presidential candidate Republicans, and *even if they did*, it would be premature to suggest that they do so because of immigration. (Polling might suggest most jews are liberal on immigration, but that isn’t the same thing)."
123,fkpk9rg,"&gt; Christians are 10% of the Arab population inside Israel. Many of them are pro Israel. 

However most of them, like other arab Israeli citizens, identify to some degree as Palestinian and are certainly not Zionist. 

In fact due to Israel banning essentially all immigration by non jews I think the majority of christians in Israel / Palestine are Palestinian / arab. 

&gt; You can’t claim that in the holy land being Christian is equivalent to being Palestinian or pro Palestinian.

I did not claim that at all. You however denied that Palestinian christians existed at all which is bigoted beyond belief. 

Jews make up about 2% of the USA population. So it as if you said, “Americans aren’t jewish, Americans are all christian, jewish Americans don’t exist”."
124,ff708ls,"Oh man, there's quite the rabbit-hole to fall down with this one.

When you start thinking about how, under Trump, the United States decided to recognize Jerusalem as the capitol of Israel, and move the embassy there from Tel Aviv...

Then think about how Trump, through his Executive Order, was recently trying to get ""Jewish"" recognized as a race, so they can claim that all Jewish Americans are really Israeli-Americans instead... 

Then think about how before the rapture can happen, the Jews need to return to Jerusalem...

Then think about the Trump administration's immigration (read: deportation) policy...

Because from there it's not a far leap to assume the claim ""Their true allegiance lies with Israel"" will be uttered eventually; and although the backlash will be fierce at first, it will only take a few news cycles for that sentiment to be normalized.

Hopefully you see where I'm going with this.

Source? That sounds incredibly unlikely. Especially seeing as [child marriage is legal in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage_in_the_United_States) and [more than 200,000 children married in US over the last 15 years](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/200000-children-married-us-15-years-child-marriage-child-brides-new-jersey-chris-christie-a7830266.html). Yeah that's right, the country where it's perfectly legal to marry fucking children says my  country has the child abuse problem. Hilarious. 

&gt;Living in a bubble? Reddit is grossly exaggerated when it comes to muh financial ruin. A lot of people have healthcare and (sadly) we subsidize the poor people in the U.S. and they also have free healthcare (MEDICAID).

I'm pretty sure it's you that's living in a bubble. Here are some facts [two-thirds of people who file for bankruptcy cite medical issues as a key contributor to their financial downfall.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/11/this-is-the-real-reason-most-americans-file-for-bankruptcy.html) and the fact that [41 percent of working-age Americans (roughly 72 million Americans) have medical bill problems or are paying off medical debt.](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/survey-79-million-americans-have-problems-medical-bills-or-debt) Clearly, you know nothing about how the average American lives. Go educate yourself. 

&gt;They're not even close to what your dumbass calls concentration camps.

Dude, families are being separated from eachother, food, water and basic hygiene products are being denied, people are living inhumane conditions and have guards pointing guns at them. How is that not a concentration camp?

Funnily enough, this isn't even my original opinion. I'm just repeating what [Jewish Americans are saying](https://www.vox.com/first-person/2019/6/20/18693058/aoc-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-concentration-camps-immigration-border). Unless you're also saying that Jews are also wrong to call them concentration camps?"

131,enj4f3b,"&gt;and every other Jew in congress being a hardcore immigration dove.

But that's my point. Jewish Americans are in favor of immigration policies that actually hurt Jews as a whole in the long run. If, as the theorists hold, Jews in power actually want what's good for Jews more than anything, you wouldn't see this occur.

&gt;Where the Jew:Muslim ratio is lower, such as Britain, France, or Israel, Jews tend to be more restrictionist.

Yet Israel is 18% Muslim and growing..."
132,egub9b5,"And he is Jewish. Now that the left has jumped the shark and supports the immigration of radical Muslims, old jewish men are definitely out of vogue"
133,ed2wowp,"&gt; What is weird is that Jews overwhelmingly vote Democrat while military support mainly comes from Republicans.

I don't think that's weird at all. Jewish Americans are, first and foremost, Americans. Jewish Americans are not Israeli, and vice versa. American-Israeli relations is an issue that many Jewish Americans care about, but it's one issue out of many. Reform and Conservative Jewish American attitudes tend to fall on the liberal side of most social issues (racial equality, gay rights, immigration, environmental protection, etc.), so in order to vote Republican, most Jewish Americans would have to ignore their values on all of those issues and essentially be single-issue voters -- and that's even assuming that most Jewish Americans agree with the Republican position on Israel, which many don't.

&gt; As for the disproportional high percentages in Congress, I believe that this is due to Jews living in tight knit communities.

The ""tight-knit communities"" thing really refers only to Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities. Most Jewish Americans live in the same communities as everyone else. I think there's maybe one Orthodox Jew currently serving in Congress (Ben Cardin, Maryland), and he's a senator, so the particular community he came from doesn't matter much in the context of a statewide election."
134,ea3hoi0,"&gt; BS. Nearly half of Israeli Jews are Ashkenazi.

2.8 million of full or partial descent, so unless you're counting all partial descent, no.

&gt; Again, you are incorrect. Read some more recent research:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_studies_on_Jews

In 1992 G. Lucotte and F. David were the first genetic researchers to have documented a common paternal genetic heritage between Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews.

Another study published just a year later suggested the Middle Eastern origin of Jewish paternal lineages.[33]

In 2000, M. Hammer, et al. conducted a study on 1371 men and definitively established that part of the paternal gene pool of Jewish communities in Europe, North Africa and Middle East came from a common Middle East ancestral population. They suggested that most Jewish communities in the Diaspora remained relatively isolated and endogamous compared to non-Jewish neighbor populations.

In a study of Israeli Jews and Palestinian Muslim Arabs, more than 70% of the Jewish men and 82% of the Arab men whose DNA was studied, had inherited their Y chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors, who lived in the region within the last few thousand years. ""Our recent study of high-resolution microsatellite haplotypes demonstrated that a substantial portion of Y chromosomes of Jews (70%) and of Palestinian Muslim Arabs (82%) belonged to the same chromosome pool.""[35] In relation to the region of the Fertile Crescent, the same study noted; ""In comparison with data available from other relevant populations in the region, Jews were found to be more closely related to groups in the north of the Fertile Crescent (Kurds, Turks, and Armenians) than to their Arab neighbors.

Approximately 35% to 43% of Jewish men are in the paternal line known as haplogroup J[Note 1] and its sub-haplogroups. This Haplogroup is particularly present in the Middle East, Southern Europe, and Northern Africa.[36] Fifteen to 30% are in haplogroup E1b1b[Note 2], (or E-M35) and its sub-haplogroups.

Your study being more recent doesn't make it more correct.

&gt; The ethnic ties of European Ashkenazi Jews to Israel exist only in a bronze age book of fairy tales, they are ""genetically European"" going back to the end of the ice age. If Zionism referred only to Mizrahi Jews, then that would be a different conversation.

Yeah alright bud. Whatever you say. I'm sure you know better than most geneticists.

&gt; So you believe the native population taking back their land (like in anti-colonialism) always results in a massacre of the settlers? At the same time, you also believe that Jews from Europe are the natives of Israel, and the Palestinians are the settlers. So, in your view, does Zionism also require a massacre of the Palestinians?

I think it would be pretty disingenuous to call whites who lived there for generations settlers. Same for the Palestinians.

&gt; This makes no sense, it is completely backwards. The Jews who came to Israel were already somewhere else. How can they have ""no where to go"" when they were already living in various places in Europe? 

Yeah. Living in Europe worked out fantastic. Wonderful. So wonderful no one wanted to leave right? I'm *sure* that the Europeans would love to have us back right?? As for the Sephardic/Mizrahi, they most certainly have no where to go, I don't think you can dispute that.

&gt; And just because you think the arabs living there can just be herded off somewhere else like animals, doesn't make it so. Just because you can go live somewhere else, doesn't give me the right to come take over your home and kick you out by force.

You'll be happy to know that they weren't, all Arabs living in Israeli controlled territory were offered Israeli citizenship. Did you think Israels 20% Arab population crawled out of the dead sea a couple years ago or something?

&gt; Well, obviously. White supremacy also doesn't discriminate against a specific nationality, as it considers all non-white groups to be inferior. In principle, Jewish supremacy and Zionism doesn't discriminate against anyone specifically, as it gives everyone non-Jewish fewer rights. In practice, it pretty much only discriminates against Palestinians.

It doesn't fit the definition, get over it.

&gt; None of those countries allow the ""immigration privilege"" of displacing someone else and taking their over property by force.

You're right, thats *exactly* what people who make aliyah do. Yup. They have to take over some poor Arabs home before they die of dehydration. We do it to weed out the weak ones since they wouldn't be able to serve in the IDF anyway."
135,e8iteq0,"Agreed. That 5-part series was an extremely interesting read. I had always suspected that America's superpower status enabled the global spread of the Jewish intellectual movements that Kevin MacDonald so thoroughly documented and exposed. It was great to see someone putting in the effort to document that phenomenon. 

This series of articles will be a great resource to cite to all of the people who argue that Jews can't be blamed for how cucked most White Western nations are because there's barely any Jews in those countries. Even though Brenton Sanderson convincingly proved that Australian Jews played a large role in subverting White Australians, the ideas and popular culture that Jewish Americans are creating and promulgating probably would have brainwashed most White Australians anyway. 

The Americanization of the world isn't just fast food and hip hop [lack of] culture, it's also the adoption of leftist Jewish-American values on immigration and diversity. "
136,e9md53u,"There's no question that Jewish Americans are a ""model minority"", i.e. they have better socioeconomic success than average. They value education and professional careers and do a great deal to encourage their children in those endeavours, they're often very socially tight-knit and offer each other support and assistance, and many of them feel a sense of loyalty to Israel as well as to the country of their citizenship. So not everything you've said is necessarily wrong, but I think a great deal of it is somewhat twisted.

Jewish people are overrepresented in terms of professional careers, business ownership, and wealth because that's always been their historical niche. As I understand it, they first came to Europe as merchants, and part of their success is that their strong kinship bonds and presence in every major city assisted them in building international trade and finance networks in medieval Europe, where movement of people was otherwise quite rare.

In part because of their conspicuous financial success and in part because they belonged to a different religion in an era when that was a really big deal, there have always been harsh anti-semitic laws, outbreaks of anti-Jewish violence, and a tendency of host countries to expel them and keep their belongings. This has led the Jewish people as a culture to historically value wealth in easily transportable/tradeable forms (diamonds, gold, fine art), hence the large Jewish presence in diamond-trading  and the fine art world, as opposed to say, real estate/agriculture/mining, where land can be easily seized without compensation by the local king if he has a pressing need to fund a war or find someone to blame for losing one.

Globalization has meant that carving out a niche in international trade and finance during the Middle Ages has paid enormous dividends, leading to a fairly substantial number of Jewish people becoming very, very wealthy, which has in turn led to many of them purchasing the kinds of thing wealthy people like to buy: casinos, newspapers, Hollywood studios, etc.

Unfortunately, close cultural ties, a worldwide presence due to historical trading networks, physical separation resulting from laws about where Jews are allowed to live, Jewish laws about who Jews are allowed to marry and still remain Jewish, mutual xenophobia arising from years of persecution, and involvement in international trade, finance, and the media is pretty much the perfect recipe if you're looking for a group of people to blame for your problems, which is typically when the Jews run into trouble - everything's cool until there's a recession or crisis, and then ignoramuses (and unscrupulous politicians) start looking for scapegoats. Jews are usually extremely convenient.

The other outcome is that Jewish people feel permanently unsafe in the countries in which they live, and it's hard to blame them - anti-Jewish violence is the norm all over the world, and it's rare that they've ever been made welcome - hard-ceilinged quotas are a common Jewish experience in both immigration and education. The most recent shooting in Pittsburgh is standard issue in the Jewish experience. So when they founded Israel after WW2 to provide a safe haven if it ever looks like someone's about to start rounding them up for mass murder again, many Jews developed a secondary loyalty to Israel to go along with the loyalty they feel for the country they actually live in. I won't lie, it can create weird tensions, but no different than it would if, say, a person was a dual French-American citizen and advocated policies to the American government that were beneficial to France and questionable for America.

**Edit:** to make it even more clear, and at the risk of setting off a firestorm, I think it's always wise to make note of who owns the news network or Hollywood studio whose output you consume, and to question what biases they have that are communicated to their staff and affect the tone of their output. If an industrial titan owns a news channel that tells you industrial waste isn't that bad for our rivers, you should stop and think. If a Jewish man with dual American-Israeli citizenship owns a news channel that tells you Israel deserves America's unconditional support, you should also stop and think. I don't consider that antisemitic.

Phew, this post got long. Happy to answer any follow-up questions you have."
137,e0hn0g4,"&gt; Israel is not the jewish nation. Instead it is a jewish nation.

What other Jewish nation is there?  There are countries where Jews live but Israel is the only country where Jews are natives.  

&gt; . It is deeply offensive and antisemitic to say that jews from anywhere have to support the policy of israel and not undermine it

I didn't say that.  I said they have to support Israel and not undermine it.  I said nothing about policy. 

&gt;  Netanyahu is not the king of the jews

Is he anointed by the people of Israel as their prime leader.  That is literally the definition of King of the Jews.  He's not literally a king so it comes down to interpretation but I don't have a huge problem seeing him in a blurry sense that way.  

&gt; Dual loyalty is a trope many American jews face, and its a trope that is wrong to embellish.

I don't think you are Jewish.  I have to tell you if so, you don't get a vote in what positions Jews should take with respect to their communities.  As for dual loyalty, Jews are loyal to Israel the way Italians are to Italy.  Italian-Americans, Irish-Americans, German-Americans, Japanese-Americans... have faced some dual loyalty claims against them, and Jews should be held to the same standards not higher nor lower.  

&gt; Irish Americans can trace their ancestors directly back to Ireland usually within a generation or two, 

Irish immigration was mostly during the potato famine ( https://elhambre.weebly.com/uploads/1/6/4/8/16486624/8248113_orig.gif ) try more like 8 generations.

&gt; The more salient point is that Irish Americans are allowed to oppose the policy of Ireland.

Jewish Americans are allowed to oppose the policy of Israel, they do so all the time.   Irish Americans were not allowed to say support the deliberate policy of starvation of the Irish into submission when she wiped out a 1/4 of the population, Queen Victoria's application of BDS against them.  

&gt; In fact they aren't expected to have any opinion on it one way or another.

Of course they have opinions.  Green vs. Orange parades, the IRA until recently...  

&gt; Seriously illegal? So you can be arrested for supporting a boycott of israel? 

You can be deported for supporting BDS. 

&gt; were afrikaan opponents of apartheid also traitors?

Being an opponent of apartheid no. Those who worked with the UN, Brits and ANC to demonize their own people, yes.  

&gt; You should at least start questioning people who protest against animals cruelty

I'm a strong opponent of animal cruelty. But I don't obsesses over the mistreatment of chickens and completely ignore the problems with abuse of pigs.  

&gt; Are you familiar with the poem, as it speaks directly to your position:

Who is the ""they"" in your analogy?  

"
138,dtsp0qo,"
&gt; The one issue I have with what you said is that the alt-right's anti-semitism is not sincere. It very much is. Every white nationalist and racist ideology eventually gets around to including antisemitism if it isn't present from the start. Thats not to say that Jews may not adopt some or all of these ideas; racism does not need to be consistent to be effective.

I believe that it is very sincere, but I believe their hostility arises in large part from their conflict with liberal Jews who have been at the forefront of opposing white nationalism, an opposition which is completely understandable after the horror of WW2, but an opposition that has also spawned a movement that is hostile to Israeli nationalism. 

From my understanding, Orthodox Jews are much more disturbed by anti-semitism on the left (BDS, Obama's embrace of Iran, etc.) than they are by white nationalists in the United States, and I foresee a future where this trend will accelerate, with many right-wing Jews beginning to choose the right-wing fold, which will become increasingly ethno-nationalist. 

Jewish-Americans are largely perceived as white by POCs, who have significantly [more anti-semitic beliefs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/02/19/entrenched-anti-semitic-views-very-rare-among-whites-and-asian-americans-common-among-blacks-and-latinos/) on average than white people. In Europe, the acceleration of mass Muslim immigration will make it harder for Jewish-Europeans to live out peaceful lives without the threat of anti-Semitic violence. 

Meanwhile, the Muslim vote in European states will lead to Corbyn-like figures who are more critical of Israel, its building of settlements, etc. 

In the United States, the rising tide of color will lead to leftist politicians who are also more hostile to Israel's policies, and in the US, are likely to advocate more socialistic economic policies that will alienate the Jewish right. 

Thus, in an age of global apartheid, we will see a wedge driven into the Jewish-American vote, with some Jews embracing anti-Zionist leftism, and others embracing pro-Zionist right wing politics (which will have its fair share of antisemites). 

I could be wrong, but I see the future of politics as choosing between a pro-apartheid or anti-apartheid system of government; whether in Israel, Europe, or the United States. 

Neil Blomkamp, the ex-South-African director of District 9 and Elysium, has been [commenting on and predicting this trend](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10244979/Neill-Blomkamp-interview-Elysium-isnt-science-fiction.-Its-now.html) for a while."
139,dqyp2m3,"&gt;Jewish Americans are [mostly Democrats]

This is true, but does not somehow prove Republicans are more antisemitic. Neo-Nazism is not associated with the Republican Party. It's associated with the ""alt right"" and other more fringe groups who absolutely *hate* the Republicans for being so close to Israel. 

&gt;You're right that Republicans are more fervent supporters of Israel than Democrats, but I'm not really sure that deserves to be praised when many of them do so out of religious extremism that is arguably anti-Semitic at its core 

I...don't even know how to respond to such an irrational claim. Antisemitic at its core? You're just flat out wrong on this one. Seriously, turn on Fox News if you can bare. They literally have ads asking Fox viewers to do note to Jews in Israel. Sean Hannity himself is personally close friends with Netanyahu. 

As for the alt right and Trump, these antisemitic millennials on the right are a relatively new thing. And while they supported Trump largely because of his stance on immigration, that doesn't mean Trump himself is antisemitic. The reality is far from it. Trump recently moved the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Trump's own daughter is Jewish, as well as his son in law, and I believe one of his son's wives. 

Ask Ben Shapiro who is more antisemitic. He'll definitely acknowledge the alt right's antisemitism, but has noted for years the antisemitism on the left. "

&gt; you adopt their culture so you will become one with the ethnic majority.

Culture # Ethnicity 

There are black Americans, white Americans, Jewish Americans... Are you going to tell me that Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bernie Sanders don't share the same American culture ?

I've lived in France all my life and I am as French as can be, and yet I'm also Jewish, and take part in religious celebrations with family and friends every now and then.

&gt; It helps make a stronger nation.

Ah, I think I know what kind of person I'm answering to. Every nation in the history of the world had to face immigration. No successful nation is ethnically pure.

&gt; A modern example would be poland refusing to let in muslims because they won't become culturally polish.

Muslims aren't Jews. And how do they even know they won't become culturally Polish if there aren't any muslims in Poland ? Are you Polish ?

&gt; It's why hitler disliked jews, and why there is anti-semitism in the modern world

I can't believe people still think that, Hitler hated Jews because Jews were an easy scapegoat to pick on, as they had been for centuries in Europe.

If there is still anti-semitism in Europe, it's because of a lack of education."
143,dlts6dm,"There is a huge huge undeniable difference in IQs between certain groups. Ashkenazi Jewish men are the highest by far and others far lower. There is huge empirical proof. I carry I Ashkenazi male gene, though I do not really express it nor am I religious.

Automation is really going to wake up folks and the theory of UBI is going to really infuriate the masses when they realize immigration has to completely stop. 

Anyway, using history's cyclical changes, things get dicey in the 60s (1760, 1860,1960s) so I predict a massive social divide in the 2060s. Whites will be a minority and obviously still control almost all the wealth and power. Something has to give socially and even financially. Current course is troubling to be sure. "

146,f1x0fjs,"&gt; I literally said that I was wrong, but it doesn't matter.

No you didn't, and yes it matters that you made the error, that you're so slow to acknowledge it, and the manner of the error that shows you didn't actually read what he took the time to share with you, but instead went looking (disingenuously) for a way to immediately discredit it.

&gt; The central point is the linking of totally irrelevant Nazi propaganda.

It isn't ""Nazi propaganda"". It's an article by Ben Stein that was published on E! Online, that happens to be re-hosted by a dumpster website.

&gt;You're free to provide any evidence to that point

Anybody with any knowledge about the workings of publishing knows what a copy editor is and knows authors of articles almost never choose the headlines (particular someone writing freelance like Stein would have been. Good grief).. But be obtuse, whatever.

&gt;And he proceeded to link a conspiracy theorist. Interesting how that all comes together. 

Ben Stein isn't a conspiracy theorist, to the best of my knowledge.

&gt;Which is totally why he linked an antisemitic conspiracy website. Because he . . . wasn't making that argument. Lol okay.

He linked an article by Jewish celebrity Ben Stein, originally published on E Online. That's what he found and what he shared.

&gt;He literally stated that foreigners would think America would be 50% black based on their depiction in media.

Given that Americans themselves over-estimate the black population of Americans (they think it's 30%+) it isn't that far a reach. Edit: just checked and 17% of America thinks blacks are more than 50% of the population.

&gt;Are you actually fucking serious right now?

Yes. Your response to him, like to me know, is to represent his position as talking about industry as a whole. i.e. something that can be refuted by the study you offered. But he specifically said ""*many forms of American media*"" and later amended his position to ""*relevant/popular forms of media that tend to reach audiences outside of the United States*"".

&gt;I've never been a conservative person linking Nazi propaganda after complaining about black people in media and going on unrelated tangents about Jews, no.

Which isn't what I asked. What I asked was whether you had ever posted a source without vetting its host. You sidestepped that question and answered one you posed yourself. Hmm.

&gt;Which he did.

No he didn't. He said nothing about them having ""control"" over Hollywood, and he was very explicit about this.

&gt;In the context of white actors. Holy fucking shit. 

No, in the context of ""dominating the industry"". And when he suggested you were thinking of ethnic Jews, you had the opportunity to sidestep it. Instead you directly challenged him. You opened that door.

His response to you was ""*Jewish Americans are even more over represented in the media than whites*"". Your statement was ambiguous that he didn't think you were just talking about actors (and why would you be when his initial position isn't specific to acting?), his reply was ""in the media"", and you didn't correct him. You told him to prove it.

&gt;Which is different from literally stating that Jews run and are in charge of Hollywood. Which is probably why the article is being hosted on a Nazi website,

The article doesn't state that Jews control Hollywood, in the way you set out, and in the way you insinuate about the article.

&gt; even though the author probably didn't intend for it to be antisemitic. 

Excuse me: the article isn't remotely antisemitic.

&gt;Of course, you also ignored me pointing that in order to find the article, you literally had to search both the author's name and ""Do Jews Run Hollywood""

I addressed this as a crass misrepresentation of the point I made, twice.

I found the article on the search engine. That doesn't mean that the search terms I used are what's necessary to find the article on Google. It demonstrates that its finder doesn't have to go near the site's main page.

&gt;There is literally a giant ""main page"" button at the bottom of the article, and the main page makes it painfully obvious what the site is about. 

A giant main page button that he has no reason whatsoever to click. You have a burden to show it isn't reasonable to think he may not have known about the host site's content. You clearly fall well short of this burden.

&gt;Just gonna quote myself here:

&gt;. . . Yes, it matters that in a discussion about diversity the other person is linking me an article that is being used as Nazi propaganda, after directly stating they weren't claiming that Jews run Hollywood.

Well done champ. You've stated ""it matters"" without stating why. I know you think it matters. I'm waiting for you to provide a reason that doesn't presume something you cannot demonstrate (that he was aware of the content of the host site), because otherwise you're just stating it in bad faith."
147,ecx1yd0,"I’ve experienced a binary of Jewish men. One half are sex perverts and whores. The other half are impractical boys with ineffectual wrists in search of a surrogate mother. The tone of physical affection can range from sublimated teat suckling to carnal acts of disgusting degrees. 

Across the board, regardless of job or academic pedigree, Jews are smart in ways that can be either witty, charming, imposing, overbearing, or annoying. I attribute this to genealogical Torah study.

Penises are consistently cicumcised (which I personally prefer).

And generally, Jewish men are people with tastes and appetites. Men of pleasure and comfort, whether their indulgences regard gastronomy, literature, art, sex, or the general domain of the home.

Addendum: I’ve excluded fratty Jewish boys from my personal analysis."
148,fphxu1v,"Ok take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt.

I was raised in a very strict Orthodox Jewish family.  In fact we've got a lot in common with the Amish.  But I was a rebel, a trouble maker and later a barking mad militant feminist in a lesbian relationship one of my professors.   

There are a lot of reasons for my moronic selfish behavior but if I had to pick one major reason why I did what I did...  I needed (still need) very strong masculine men in my life.  My father is a good and wonderful man but he can't do much more than recite the Talmud.  Needless to say being the head of the house and putting his foot down are just impossible for him to do.   Sadly most ""nice Jewish boys"" are just that;  they're only ""nice boys."" 

My husband is a convert to our faith.   

My husband is a mechanic, a boxer and loves body building.  He drag races, listens to rockabilly music, is a huge fan of the Undertaker and when push comes to shove, he has no problems slugging a man.  He's the head of house and as such he takes no sh\*t from anyone, including me. - In a nutshell, I respect him for being a man.

As I see it, the problem with feminism is that today's men aren't really ""men.""  Instead they're just ""nice boys.""  So if men want feminist to stop their crap then men need to step up to the plate be real men again.   Until that happens things will only get worse."
149,ftpvdyr,"In my experience, Jewish-Americans are a _really_ mixed bag. A lot of the non-Orthodox ones will be reflexively sympathetic to Israel while at the same time having mixed feelings about it.

Some are unconditionally pro-Israel, but from what I've seen, there's not actually all that many of them. Non-Orthodox Jews are one of the most heavily leftwing demographics in the US, and as Israel is a rightwing, heavily nationalistic country, a lot of American Jews are aware on some level that Israel does not share their values.

Still, that's not preventing quite a few of them from being hypocrits about it. Granted, Jewish-Americans who put serious thought into their political positions are usually either consistently anti-zionist or pro-Israel conservative. But among the rank &amp; file, there's quite a few people who make a point of denouncing all forms of nationalism as racist and evil, while with the same breath praising zionism's _Blut und Boden_ outlook.

OTOH, there's also Jewish people who realize that their appreciation of Israel and their rejection of nationalism are at odds with one another, and who will even admit to being conflicted about it.

The Orthodox Jews are a very different story, though. They're either even more rabidly pro-Israel than any Evangelical, or they're the most fanatical anti-zionists you've ever seen. No middle ground."
150,fnxnsp6,"You could at least just be honest and say ""I'd rather we don't talk about this so I don't have to feel guilty for not caring"" 

America has let antisemitism bubble under the surface unchecked for decades. Your proposed solution of burying our heads in the sand and ignoring these people as they indoctrinate and radicalize and expand their influence is exactly how we've gotten to the point where it's now boiling over. 

Jewish Americans are being gunned down in their synagogues and people are boldly and proudly proclaiming that they see us as subhuman and proudly self-identifying as Nazis. We don't all have the luxury of pretending these people are just ""trolls"" who will go away if they're ignored. And many of us have grown up with relatives who lived through the Holocaust - my own great-grandparents barely escaped Vilnius before the near-complete (90%) eradication of its Jewish population - and so we know what happens when the general public doesn't resist or push back or speak out against this kind of rhetoric. 

The only people you're serving with your comments are the people in the photos. By protecting them from backlash or social consequences in the name of ""not giving them a platform"", all you do is embolden them further and allow their vitriol to be normalized. A big recruiting tactic of antisemites is pushing the narrative that all non-Jews secretly agree with them; that there is a ""silent majority"" who agree that Jews are the reason for all evil in the world and that we're at fault for all of their own problems and failings and that the world would be a better place if we all just died. 

When you go out of your way to try and silence people who are expressing their anger or disgust with antisemites, you're validating that viewpoint. You're actively giving fuel to one of their favorite antisemitic tropes. 

I suspect you already know this full well, though. ""Ignore them and they'll go away"" has never been effective when dealing with racists and antisemites, but your comment history is fit to burst with examples of you trying to shut down and silence conversations on this subreddit where people condemn the protestors. Play dumb all you want, but you know who you're helping with your constant ""caring about this is just giving them a platform"" spam."
151,fd77dxp,"A lot of reasons.

For one thing, the US constantly just keeps throwing money at Israel and they do fuck-all when we need help. Syria, one of our supposed “enemies of America” did more to help us during 9/11 than Israel. So we’re frustrated that we just keep giving them money when they haven’t done anything for us.

For another, most of the corrupt men in charge of politics and entertainment happen to be Jewish. So these evil Jewish men are casting a sour light on the rest of Judaism.

Yet another reason is because it becomes less and less possible to even criticize anyone who is Jewish. Laws are actually put in place to ensure that any negative criticism against the Jews result in jail time.

One last reason why is because hating the Jews is a historical thing. We’ve been doing it since the very beginning, and we don’t plan on stopping.

There are several other reasons, but those are some that I have come across."
152,fb9eb35,"&gt;Fine I’ll address the data

Cool!  For the record, I did have a great reply, the best reply really, to your original post, but when I went to copy it to look up data, my finger slipped and I hit ""paste"" instead.  So if I came off as frustrated, that, and also your ""post hog"" bit, is why.  And I'm sorry.  This could've been a better exchange and I messed it up.

&gt;It shows a decrease in overall hate crime but a higher increase in violent hate crimes and overall, African Americans and Jewish Americans are the highest percentage affected by said violent hate crimes. Meaning that while less crimes are being committed, of the few remaining, a greater share is violent crime. This correlates with the events I’ve brought up showing massive violent hate crimes against a Black church, a synagogue, and several other minorities.

And my comment on that would be, I'd say that it means that while we're have less racial tensions, the ones that occur are becoming more violent because the racists feel more and more marginalized.  Which isn't great and isn't pretty, but a good trend overall.  Also, I did notice a bump recently, but I wouldn't say it's more significant than any other bump in the data we have.

I also think (off the data) that alot of people  felt emboldened after our president, Donald J Trump, was elected.  I wouldn't say it has any correlation to *his* comments(and I also noticed the comments you posted originally weren't even racial), but rather the ~~propaganda~~ reporting from our fine journalists.  Racists aren't known for their intelligence, you know.

I think that's the long and short of my thoughts on your post, there.  So I'll leave with this quote, by a great American, maybe the best American: ""[racism is evil](https://youtu.be/xJZQ8TfXb4Y)"
153,fcol6wb,"""Then Nixon, who loved Israel and Israelis (but hated American Jews)""

Exactly right! this summed it up! 
 It is true that US support to Israel is solely based on the Christian Zionist agenda not to support Jews.
Most Jewish Americans are against Israel.  Christian Zionists have great influence on US presidents.  
It is all about Jesus story and their hope to bring him back to life.

This is why  I always say that targeting US society with atheism will bring peace to our world.  Christianity is the mother lode of all evil."
154,f0oir1u,"It was (sometimes still is) hard, because the post-racial utopia isn't here yet and even if it was, people still form cultural/social groups, and I don't fit entirely into either one.  It is an odd thing to realize that not matter what room you walk into, you look different from everyone else (Yay Portugal . . . it wasn't a full match, but I could blend there - I need to visit Brazil one of these days).  Guess what, many white (and Asian and Jewish) Americans are still kind of racist towards black people, so there's that (I hate the term African-American - my family has no cultural ties to Africa) On the other hand, because I was raised in a predominately white community, I ""talk white"" and ""act white"" and can never really be accepted in the black community either.  .  I have a college degree, which was not too unusual in my family, and am not religious at all.  I am a picky eater uninterested in ""soul food"" or food in general in a culture that traditionally values home cooking.  These factors distance me from at least the generations of my aunts/uncles/grandparents.  (If this sounds far-fetched, Google ""is Obama really black?"")

I think things are a little better now - being biracial seems to be kind of cool - but it was odd in the 1970s and 1980s.  There was  never an option to check two or more boxes on those forms asking about your ethnicity (If I was lucky, there was ""Other"" - my life in a nutshell).  My parents and I were always stared at in every restaurant we walked into.  My white mother was constantly asked if I was adopted.   Apparently, I am visually ambiguous;  people guessing my ethnicity have varied all over the place: Hispanic, subcontinental Asian, Middle Eastern, Australian aborigine, Jewish.  I can't entirely account for this with the usual ""All (people outside my own ethnic group) look alike"" phenomenon - just a couple of months ago I went (along with three white people) to an Ethiopian restaurant, and the Ethiopian waitress took one look at me and immediately asked me if I was from such-and-such Ethiopian town. Not sure what effect this had on my identity formation, except that I just have to resort to being myself, which is not a terrible thing.

All that said, I grew up with a lot of academically competitive Chinese and Jewish kids, and those were my peers and my friends.  I was teased a little by other cliques in school, but everyone was teased for something, and I never felt physically threatened or demeaned.  My friends were my friends, and it wasn't until I was older that I realized that some of their parents were maybe not so keen on having me around.  

It wasn't until I left my California bubble that I realized how much subtle racism there is.  It's kind of worse than overt stuff, because I have to invest mental bandwidth to knowing what is really going on.  In day to day interactions, am I just experiencing terrible customer service, like everyone else?  Or did the person who is being shitty to me just get up on the wrong side of bed, or maybe their dog just died, or maybe they're just an asshole?  Or yes, are they being racist, which is something I maybe have to deal with differently.  When people speak of ""white privilege,"" what comes to mind to me is how much more time you have available to get on with life when you don't have to devote any bandwidth to things like that.

Anyway.  I have the problems that any person of color in the United States (or non-dominant group anywhere) has.  I have a few extra because I don't have a natural and obvious group of my own to fall back on for support.  So I've cobbled together my own, which lots of people do, because having a family/community that looks just like you is a nice start but hardly a guarantee that they are reliable/accepting/nurturing/not basically evil.

I'm fiftysomething.  I'm still trying to figure out who the hell I am.   I only recently realized I have ADHD, and that that, not my racial status, has probably been the biggest factor in how my life has turned out so far.  I'm probably asexual.  Last week I went on r/abrathatfits, and discovered that I've been wearing the wrong size for my whole life.  A couple of years ago I realized my vocal range is contralto, which is why I always thought I ""couldn't sing.""  I have a lot of identities to sort out that don't have anything to do with my skin color/racial categorization.

At the time that statement was made to me, by a supervisor, I was twentysomething, had recently graduated from a decent college, and was living/working in England on a work exchange program.  I had my first boyfriend and the normal drama that goes along with that.  I was performing well in the job.  I have no idea what she saw that made her think I was suffering so much that I'd have been better off aborted.

And it's not an odd question.  My BFF of 30+ years is white; we've never talked about race.  It has recently come to her attention (she read a book I guess)  that although we come from similar socioeconomic backgrounds, graduated from the same college, and have both had relatively successful careers, that our life experiences and perceptions are in many ways *not* the same at all and that some of that *is* due to racial differences.  I am a little annoyed that this would be a huge revelation to her at this stage in the game, but to be fair, we really can't ever see the world through someone else's eyes.  All we can do is ask."
155,ex2z9zi,"In Judaism, when you study mysticism, they tell you that G-d 10 has good and evil parts and some are male and some are female and they're fucking each other.

Then you get into the real mysticism, and they say that what you learned at first was a crude oversimplification.  You're silly for thinking that's what Jews believe.  There are actually over 600 parts and they're all fucking each other and of course Jesus was a son of G-d because technically all Jewish men are sons of G-d.

But I could be wrong, it's been a long time since I've studied Jewish mysticism."
156,eyclcdd,"&gt; people who are not Christian have no foundation at all to build from. When they do something evil, that's just to be expected

With ideas like this being spread by individual evangelical pastors, its no surprise that Jewish Americans are being targeted for violence in increasing numbers once again."
157,eu8t34l,"...that still sounds like bigotry, just bigotry that has a root rationalized cause.

Hell, if that is good enough to get you off the hook for bigoted behaviors and beliefs then most of GC probably gets off the hook. 
  There's a massive ""peak trans"" thread on that sub where they discuss when they realized they need to stand up to 'gender ideology,' and it is absolutely filled to bursting with these sorts of ""a trans person was mean to me so they're all bad!"" stories.

Bottom line, individual encounters with people never justifies generalizing that to the rest of the person's minority group.  I don't get a license to start harping on about how violent and evil Jewish men are, just because my ex happened to be Jewish and sadistically abusive. 

That would rightfully get me called out as a bigot and antisemite.  

So my question is...why do TERFs get a pass on their hatred, just because they've found a way to rationalize it?"

&gt;	There are two comments from Representative Omar that have recently come to light - one from last week regarding AIPAC, and other from a few years ago regarding Israel’s influence over the American government - that have sparked claims of antisemitism from some and defenses of pure criticism of the Israeli government from others. This can be a maddening exercise in futility or an opportunity to help each other, Jews and non-Jews, better understand the historical and social context of these statements, and how intentionally or unintentionally, antisemitism is harmful.

&gt;In November 2012, now-Representative Omar tweeted the following: “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” [1] Some will say that this is hardly evidence of antisemitism, as Omar is clearly referencing the actions of the Israeli government, and not Jews. This is ok. The Israeli government is not above reproach, nor should it be. In free and open societies, Jews and non-Jews are permitted - and I believe morally required - to express their disapproval of actions they believe are wrong. Personally, I find current political trends in Israel disheartening. The government’s capitalization on fear and jingoism do not serve the interests of a stable, successful Israel. Mistreatment, abuse, and persecution of Palestinians - a people deserving of self-determination and independence just as we - is abhorrent. That being said, I believe her statement is antisemitic. It is steeped in antisemitic canards, and while making no explicit reference to Jews, it is clear to those with the knowledge of the historical context that it is indeed. The key to understanding why this statement is antisemitic, is the use of “hypnotizes”. Now, I get it. That’s just one word, and how can one word be the basis upon which we stamp the label “antisemitic”. In referencing my earlier statement about antisemitism intertwining with the development of society, Jews have been for centuries ascribed the insidious quality of utilizing underhandedness and chicanery to bend global governments to our will, prioritizing the Jew over other groups. We can similarly understand the use of Israel having a “stranglehold” over American politics. So when people use this term, in the context of Israel the nation-state of the Jewish People, it evokes, preys upon, and exploits centuries of libel against Jews. To then continue denying this context, is to silence Jewish concerns over our participation in society.

&gt;Now consider this: Is the War on Drugs inherently a racist endeavor? Hard drug use - crack cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, etc - poses grave societal dangers; these substances destroy individual lives, spread blight over communities, and necessitate diversion of public funds from infrastructure, healthcare, and education. However, when we look at the historical context of the War on Drugs, we can confidently say that the motivations behind these policies are without a doubt meant to specifically harm African-Americans, both in obscene incarceration rates (creating a permanent underclass) and the facilitation of an “othering” of African-Americans (creating an image of the black male, specifically, as someone inherently violent, poor, lacking education or moral character). So too can we look at Omar’s tweet. By itself, it’s apparently an innocent critique of a foreign country’s policies. However, in accounting for the historical context and the motivations behind such a statement, we can understand how it is actually antisemitic.

&gt;Now to the more recent statement. On February 10 of this year, following a tweet from Glenn Greenwald lamenting “how much time US political leaders spend defending a foreign nation”, Representative Omar responded simply “It’s all about the Benjamins baby” [2]. Again, there’s nothing inherently antisemitic about expressing concern over influence a foreign country may have over our domestic political discourse. Also again, context matters. Omar’s glib response expresses an understanding that the “pro-Israel” lobby in the US functions by bribing our politicians to support policies they otherwise would not. Her response is steeped in a history of non-Jews ascribing certain immutable traits to Jews, traits that describe us as others (Jewish Americans are not “true” Americans, because we have “dual-loyalties”), and that we are all wealthy, and that we seek to use this wealth to control world governments. All this is not even touching on the fact that AIPAC is not a political action committee, it is a political affairs committee, meaning that AIPAC does not contribute to political campaigns and does not donate to politicians. This is also not touching on the fact that actual foreign lobbies - registered agents of those countries’ governments - from countries other than Israel spend more than Israel’s on lobbying our government."

160,evcs27i,"&gt; *Yes the average white European is a more or less a mix but a mix of European nations. Doesn't take away that they are white.*

Yes, it [actually does](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thesundayedition/the-sunday-edition-september-17-2017-1.4291332/there-is-no-such-thing-as-the-white-race-or-any-other-race-says-historian-1.4291372). Scientifically speaking, there's no such thing as the ""white race."" Or any race, for that matter.

The fact that *you* have weird issues wrapped up in your skin tone is all you, man.

&gt; *An average African is a mix but a mix of African nations.*

Go back far enough, we're *all* Africans. Sorry.
 
&gt; *Genetic clustering analysis predicts one's origin with 99.9% accuracy.*

No, it predicts the origins of a majority of your genetics. The fact that you probably have some ancestors who were what we'd call ""black"" today isn't somehow negated by the fact that more of your ancestors from a larger set of branches weren't.

And make no mistake, I'm talking about you, personally. You almost certainly have some black ancestry.

&gt; *Small children can do this also, maybe on a more broader scale though.*

I have no idea what you're talking about, here.
 
&gt; *But really your question is ""what is white"". This is what the left typically do. Trying to deconstruct white identity. Yet they would never give any second thought on who is black to deconstruct black identity or any other minority.*

I *literally* just pointed out that scientifically speaking, race doesn't exist - white or black. Of course cultures exist, but you aren't the arbiter of ""white culture."" The majority of people who identify as white disagree with you, so I'm afraid it's you, not me, who is trying to destroy white culture.

You just don't like the fact that white culture is becoming tolerant of people who don't identify as white. And, again, that's your issue, not mine.

&gt; *Whites are descendants of people that evolved from the European continent. Honestly though, if you look white, you're white enough for the ethnostate.*

No. The moment we have an ethnostate, we'll inevitably have the ""one-drop"" rule again, too, because for racists, there's no such thing as white enough.

&gt; *There is so much overwhelming evidence on how diversity lowers social cohesion, trust (we all have a preference to our race), politics becomes complicated (minorites always vote Democrat)/political tribalism, how it hurts education (bullying up there too), economic growth is negatively associated, forcing people to like you in the workplace creates the opposite effect, and so on...*

Bullshit. And not only is that bullshit, it doesn't address my point ***at all***. So no, I won't watch your racist YouTube video, but I will reiterate my point and challenge you to actually respond to it:

People who identify as one race or another fall in love with each other. Race-based countries would either have to immorally outlaw such relationships - thereby demonstrating that they are, in fact, evil in a very straightforward way - or permit them and thus rapidly lose the association of their races with their countries.

Now then: Address ***that***.
 
&gt; *A mixed child with black and white parents is easily identifiable as black on a practical level with the eye. That child simply doesn't carry much European DNA anymore to be considered white. Race mixing is also proven to be harmful*

Stop posting racist YouTube videos and make your own argument, with proper citations.

In any event, what if that child wants to express pride in his white heritage, and live in the white ethnostate? You would deny him entrance to it - there's that ""one-drop"" rule rearing its racist head.

You have not addressed the issue, you've just attempted to sidestep it, because you don't like the implication: That an ethnostate will *necessarily* have to commit evil in order to maintain itself.
 
&gt; *What's destructive to humanity is destroying identities of people and trying to scoop everyone together claiming them as equal. Yet we know certain groups cause a lot less crime and rape than others, have higher intelligence, less percentages of them on welfare, more of them contributing to society... Races aren't equal and we should stop modeling our nations likewise as it is detrimental to the soon-a-minority whites.*

This is revolting and vile. You're making thoroughly debunked claims about racial superiority now. You're behaving like a textbook example from /r/beholdthemasterrace.

&gt; *My point was that the majority of America recognizes the Jewish ethnostate to be a nation for the Jews and we have no problem with that.*

Yes we fucking *do*. Most Jewish Americans are liberal for a reason. Most of them want Israel to correct its human-rights violations and give Palestinians citizenship and equality.

&gt; *Yet replace Jewish with white and now you're a neo Nazi terrorist.*

If it walks like a Nazi duck and quacks like a Nazi duck... Look, you very clearly are proud of your racism, so how the hell else should someone describe you?

&gt; *Trump's election has shown the partial consensus of white Americans.*

Horseshit. Trump received the support of a minority (fewer votes) of a minority (low voter turnout) of the American populace. His - and your - ideas are overwhelmingly rejected by the majority of young white people, and your ideology is inevitably going to die. Can't happen soon enough, as far as this particular lily-white guy is concerned.

&gt; *Had Trump actually enforced his promises, it would certainly be a step in the right direction. But it looks like he doesn't have the power to. I wish he tried harder still.*

And this white guy - and the majority of other white guys in this country - disagree with you. How do you reconcile that with the demonstrably false notion that your racism is representative of white culture?

&gt; *It is also very taboo to talk about white nationalism.*

Yep. As it should be. I have no compunction whatsoever about making racist assholes feel ashamed about themselves. I hope their daughters and sons all marry people of color. I hope they buy 23andMe kits and find out they're 27% black. I hope they get shamed back into the darkness with their vile, unscientific, hate-filled nonsense until they die, and their ideologies die with them.

Good.

&gt; *Some have their careers stripped.*

That's capitalism, baby! Want to spew racist garbage? Well, don't be surprised if the company you work for, that wants to sell to *everyone*, decides you're more trouble than you're worth.

&gt; *Look at that Asian beauty pageant recently losing her title for merely pointing out the black on black violence statistics.*

Yep. Glad it happened.

&gt; *It wasn't used offensively or out of the blue. It was just a civil Twitter reply.*

Pfft. Read the whole thread. She was being racist. And again, that's capitalism. Beauty pageants are *businesses*, and she was being terrible for business. 

&gt; *Had people really educated themselves on what white nationalism is actually about, how it's completely moral to have a nation for whites then you'd see an explosion in our numbers.*

And you **still** haven't addressed my points that demonstrate that the exact opposite is true.

Great! Go find some other country that wants to be a racist ethnostate. Good luck.

&gt; *Financial crisis is inevitable as this welfare state won't last for long.*

Finland, Sweden, and the Denmark are all laughing at you. It's funny, really... The whitest countries in the world think your ideology is horrific and wrong.

&gt; *It's the reason why the elites push for open borders and ""diversity"". They need low wage workers.*

Diversity drives business. Why do you hate capitalism?

&gt; *Most of us accelerationists advocate voting for Yang to claim that sweet UBI.*

I guarantee that means you don't understand UBI.

161,ekvk56d,"&gt;I don't understand the antisemitism thing though- we aren't allowed to critize Judaism for its sexist practices now? Since when?

Because there's a fine line between anti-Semitism and calling out men of a racialized religion because of their treatment of women. Regardless of what you say, you and most radfems know it would be wrong to say something like 'Jewish men are evil'. It's anti-Semitic and leads to the dehumanization and abuse of those men. This is why I would never step foot in that territory, and instead let Jewish or ex-Jewish women speak on that. Of course there's a difference between criticizing Israel's treatment of Palestinians vs generalizing all Jewish people as bad. One sheds much needed light on an issue but the other is used as a confirmation bias for racist beliefs. This is why I don't have issue with Western radfems criticizing what's going on in Brunei but when they use it as confirmation bias for their prejudiced beliefs...a lot of brown women can spot the difference just like Jewish women can tell the difference between people using Israel vs. Palestine as a pawn to be anti-Semitic or just discussing it simply out of care for human rights abuses. 

&gt;If a white woman makes sure my ex-muslim cousin feels safe to come out in private, and gives her a place to discuss her hatred of religion, why would I care? 

Like I said, I understand the difference between Western radfems who actually care about us vs the ones who use it as a confirmation bias for neo-con beliefs. There's always a fine line and since I feel like it's very easy to trip over into white nationalist rhetoric (especially from what I've seen in radfem circles), my point still stands. White women can be understanding of the ways our men hurt and let us speak on it rather than championing our issues for us, viewing us all as voiceless victims, or too ignorant and brainwashed to speak for ourselves. This is a common  racist trope I see when white radfems defend their right to say Muslim men are -insert stereotype here-. 

&gt;I don't know why we're dragging the 1900s radical feminists into this, or why you're pretending that *all of them* were racist, or what this has to do with black women. I'm talking about criticism of islam, and islamic men, and not about some america-specific (or UK-specific) issue with white radfems in the past.

 I dragged that in because many black and brown women I know specifically point this out already, that just because white radfems dedicate their lives to caring about women does not mean that they can't be racist towards WoC and have actually been in the past. I never said all of them were racist, just that there were some and it's enough to still make WoC wary of some radfems who parrot white nationalists insults when it comes to describing MoC. I would like more attention on the acid attacks that happen in my country, the constant sexual abuse in areas where there is little government regulation, but when some radfems are obsessed with making jokes and memes out of brown men it's very apparent that SOME radfems just use it as an excuse to be prejudice.

&gt; If I talk about sexist cultural practices within arab culture, I'm called a ""race traitor"", and told to stop giving white women excuses to be racist. If I talk about islam critically, I am told off by women who think they can combine being a muslim, and being a radfem. And I can't talk about these issues with *only* mena women, because the overwhelming majority of mena women aren't feminists. :/

I've never heard of any woman being called a race traitor for speaking on sexism in Eastern cultures. Nor do I think me and my ex-Muslim radfem friends critiquing Islam is giving 'white women an excuse to be racist' white radfems do that on their own though we have told them numerous times to stop. I'm not really sure what women you're around. Most Americanized desi/mena women like myself are actually critical of Eastern misogyny whether liberal are radical."
162,ehutzjc,"I talked about that in the post...

&gt;	There are two comments from Representative Omar that have recently come to light - one from last week regarding AIPAC, and other from a few years ago regarding Israel’s influence over the American government - that have sparked claims of antisemitism from some and defenses of pure criticism of the Israeli government from others. This can be a maddening exercise in futility or an opportunity to help each other, Jews and non-Jews, better understand the historical and social context of these statements, and how intentionally or unintentionally, antisemitism is harmful.

&gt;In November 2012, now-Representative Omar tweeted the following: “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” 1 Some will say that this is hardly evidence of antisemitism, as Omar is clearly referencing the actions of the Israeli government, and not Jews. This is ok. The Israeli government is not above reproach, nor should it be. In free and open societies, Jews and non-Jews are permitted - and I believe morally required - to express their disapproval of actions they believe are wrong. Personally, I find current political trends in Israel disheartening. The government’s capitalization on fear and jingoism do not serve the interests of a stable, successful Israel. Mistreatment, abuse, and persecution of Palestinians - a people deserving of self-determination and independence just as we - is abhorrent. That being said, I believe her statement is antisemitic. **It is steeped in antisemitic canards, and while making no explicit reference to Jews, it is clear to those with the knowledge of the historical context that it is indeed. The key to understanding why this statement is antisemitic, is the use of “hypnotizes”. Now, I get it. That’s just one word, and how can one word be the basis upon which we stamp the label “antisemitic”. In referencing my earlier statement about antisemitism intertwining with the development of society, Jews have been for centuries ascribed the insidious quality of utilizing underhandedness and chicanery to bend global governments to our will, prioritizing the Jew over other groups. We can similarly understand the use of Israel having a “stranglehold” over American politics. So when people use this term, in the context of Israel the nation-state of the Jewish People, it evokes, preys upon, and exploits centuries of libel against Jews. To then continue denying this context, is to silence Jewish concerns over our participation in society.**

&gt;Now consider this: Is the War on Drugs inherently a racist endeavor? Hard drug use - crack cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, etc - poses grave societal dangers; these substances destroy individual lives, spread blight over communities, and necessitate diversion of public funds from infrastructure, healthcare, and education. However, when we look at the historical context of the War on Drugs, we can confidently say that the motivations behind these policies are without a doubt meant to specifically harm African-Americans, both in obscene incarceration rates (creating a permanent underclass) and the facilitation of an “othering” of African-Americans (creating an image of the black male, specifically, as someone inherently violent, poor, lacking education or moral character). So too can we look at Omar’s tweet. By itself, it’s apparently an innocent critique of a foreign country’s policies. However, in accounting for the historical context and the motivations behind such a statement, we can understand how it is actually antisemitic.

&gt;Now to the more recent statement. On February 10 of this year, following a tweet from Glenn Greenwald lamenting “how much time US political leaders spend defending a foreign nation”, Representative Omar responded simply “It’s all about the Benjamins baby” 2. **Again, there’s nothing inherently antisemitic about expressing concern over influence a foreign country may have over our domestic political discourse. Also again, context matters. Omar’s glib response expresses an understanding that the “pro-Israel” lobby in the US functions by bribing our politicians to support policies they otherwise would not. Her response is steeped in a history of non-Jews ascribing certain immutable traits to Jews, traits that describe us as others (Jewish Americans are not “true” Americans, because we have “dual-loyalties”), and that we are all wealthy, and that we seek to use this wealth to control world governments.** All this is not even touching on the fact that AIPAC is not a political action committee, it is a political affairs committee, meaning that AIPAC does not contribute to political campaigns and does not donate to politicians. This is also not touching on the fact that actual foreign lobbies - registered agents of those countries’ governments - from countries other than Israel spend more than Israel’s on lobbying our government."
163,ei3gbga,"I believe what she actually said was that she should not be required to pay get allegiance to another country to get a committee seat.

I can agree some of her language has been shitty and she should apologize for her choice of words, as she has done. It seems a little crazy that a freshmen Rep. is getting this much attention and condemnation when Trump was so much more directly using dogwhistles and has never apologized.

I do think she has made it clear she has nothing against Jewish Americans, but is against Israel due to the Palestinian situation, and is against the influence and money of AIPAC.

I think AIPAC paying for new Congress people to go take a guided tour of Israel is problematic, and that Israel should be criticized for humans rights abuses, as should the Palestinian organizations that violate human rights or attack people.

I don't think you can openly criticize AIPACs spending and influence without being accused of anti-Semitism.

I will say that Jewish Americans are just as American as any other group and that active persecution of Jewish people in our society should be unacceptable. 

And that anyone who thinks Jewish people in America are evil or secretly running the show a la Elders of Zion is an idiot and shouldn't be in any public office. "

165,dzuxmfr,"This seems like the closest thing to a serious top post, so I'm posting here. 

Even if this article isn't about a proper study, maybe it could be the basis for getting the funding to do a better study. 

One concern I have is that it's hard to know what religion really means here. It might be nice to have a study that made the ""religious groups"" Catholic, Buddhist, Baptist, Reform Jewish, Orthodox Jewish, secular bridge club, secular museum
club, and secular choir. 

That way, you could tell whether there was an effect due to belief in a higher power in general, belief in a specific creed, getting together regularly with nice people, getting together with other people regularly to enjoy something pretty, or getting together with other people regularly to sing. 

Judaism, for example, has a different approach to sexuality than Catholicism. If service-attending men's hormones levels are really different, is that equally true for all religions?

Finally, I'd like help knowing for sure what's causing what. Is it possible that attending services affects male hormones, rather than men with certain hormone profiles being more religious? If so, does that hold about equally for all religious and secular pastimes, or are there differences?

Another thought: Jewish men are supposed to have fringes on their garments and look at the fringes to ward off evil thoughts. Is there any actual relation between men looking at their fringes and those men's hormone levels?"
166,dxcfadn,"The Torah doesn't discuss looks much because it just wasn't very relevant outside of degenerate societies (like Egypt).  But Genesis 25:27 says ""When the boys grew up, Esau became an expert hunter, an outdoorsman, but Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home."".  With nothing but this info, I would guess that Esau was better looking.

Mothers don't care about their sons looks.

Jacob clearly inherited his cunning from his mother's side, which is probably why his mother sided with him, and why the daughters in that family liked him.

Orthodox Judaism today is a kind of evil version of that Israelite spirit that started with Jacob.  The orthodox jewish men are not chads, but have no trouble getting married.
"
167,dh341uh,"Why does the dwindling population of whites worldwide matter? I mean that's a pretty silly question. Dwindling population of any group of people is a cause for concern. 

It's not about being mistreated as a minority (although with the current climate and attitude towards whites, I don't doubt they would be a *hated* minority). I won't deny that being a part of the majority does have some benefits, for the western world those benefits fall to white people. But elsewhere in the native lands of Asians those benefits fall to the native populations there. I don't believe this is evil oppression or even intentional in most cases. For example in rural China I'd stick out as a outsider no matter what I do because I am clearly not native Han Chinese and nor will I ever be. 
The issue comes (and your point on""screaming white genocide"" fits here) that white people will be minorities in their own native lands, something that has rarely ended up well for previous native human groups throughout history. Now in regards to Canada, the United States and Austrialia. Those are not native white lands and so my point does not really apply. Although some would argue that because those nations were created and built by white people and shaped by European culture that they are white nations... I'm not so personally inclined. 
Yes there is some overlap between white Europeans and groups in the Middle East. Some, especially historically were what we would call white people. Though many of these groups have been subject to extreme persecution by semetic people's (no that's not only Jews but people native to the Middle East and North Africa such as Berbers and Arabs). Although if we're being honest the colloquial usage of white refers to people of European descent. To the point where it would be more correct to call white American European Americans really. 
However this was really not apart from the point. The point is there will be no or a small handful of nations where white people are the majority. Including their own native lands. What is going on in Europe can be described as population replacement... And I really cannot see it being justified against any group. Do you think the Japanese would find it perfectly acceptable to be a minority in Japan, and sould you personal to be absolutely fine with that? Please remember your answer of ""what's wrong with that"" in regards to a dwindling population of one racial group (in that case referring to whites). 
I see you support the definition of racism as ""power and privilege"" something I personally do not. What is your opinion on how whites are currently treated in South Africa? I mean surely right now that fits your model of the majority oppressing a minority?

Affirmative action is simply institutional racial discrimination for forced equal outcome. And it targets some minorities even worse than whites. Particularly Asian Americans when it comes to education. In fact in regards to your education point. European whites are underepresented in Ivy League colleges - http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/color/articles/tilove.html

https://thetab.com/us/princeton/2015/10/18/its-official-were-the-whitest-ivy-354 - though this one does not differentiate between white Americans and Jewish Americans, it still displays that whites are underepresented. Despite making up a small minority of the population, Jewish Americans are the most highly represented group in Ivy League colleges by a wide margin. You are not going to suggest they have some sort of institutional advantage are you? 

http://www.mindingthecampus.org/2010/07/how_diversity_punishes_asians/

Affirmative action is racist, period. And it targets minority groups as well as whites. Sadly this is perhaps the only way that people will realise it is a racist policy, as when it simply targets whites people don't care or say it's just a ""counter policy"", to what?

I don't think any population should be a minority in their homelands. However only white nations face this reality on a large scale right now. And it has lead to the erasure of European culture and of course the European people in their homelands, something that unsettles me. As it would and has done when it has happened to other groups.

168,f7ie5hi,"I have one serious question for you; please tell me that we agree the overall methods of law enforcement and police conduct in the US rises to the level of brutality. If we can't agree on that, then we'll just have to agree to disagree and there is nothing more to debate. 

If we can agree on that, then what is the reason why Asian &amp; Jewish Americans are the least effected by police brutality? I have a lot of trouble believing the police have racially favorable view of Asian &amp; Jewish Americans.

That Asian &amp; Jewish Americans are least effected by police brutality is an indisputable fact. Every bit of research and statistics on the subject demonstrates this to be true &amp; accurate. In my honest opinion it is not racist to believe this fact is so because Asian &amp; Jewish Americans commit the least amount of violent crimes. The methods of law enforcement in the US leave a lot to be desired and police can be brutal. The demographics that commit the least amounts of crime (Asian &amp; Jewish Americans) suffer at the hands of this brutality the least.

The definition of racism is; *prejudicial or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the believe that one's own race is superior.* In no way shape or form do I believe black, white, latino or any other group of Americans are inferior to Asian &amp; Jewish Americans nor do I have any prejudicial or antagonistic views of white, black or latino Americans when compared to Asian &amp; Jewish Americans. 

You can disagree with my opinion. I probably disagree with yours and I definitely disagree with Kap's sentiment. But my disagreement with Kap's sentiment is no way shape or form racist."
169,e1obrvz,"Article from a Jewish leftist describing the intersections between toxic masculinity and anti-Semitism.

Excerpt:

&gt; But I actually want to discuss it in the context of something else I’ve been thinking about, which is the way that cultural construction of masculinity, the gender-policing of men, affects some Diaspora Jews. I don’t have a ton of data here, this is mostly observation-based. Antisemitic stereotypes of Jews are often about ugliness, and, particularly when aimed at Jewish men, physical weakness, neuroticism, and effeminacy, the notion that Jewish men are particularly unlikely to meet cultural ideals of masculinity and that that (because this is how misogyny works) that makes them inferior. To pick a high-profile example of this from a few years back, The Forward had a very good article in 2013 about how the absurd “Pajama Boy” Obamacare-advertising controversy (I am sorry for reminding you of this exceedingly silly episode in national political discourse, but it is relevant) was grounded in antisemitism. It’s unfortunately not very hard to find antisemitic assholes propagating the idea that Jews are weak cowards who were passive in the face of genocidal violence (not going to go looking for citation links for this one, folks)."
170,do8mx0f,"The Qur'an reads (*5:116*):

&gt; When God says, ‘Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to people, “Take me and my mother as two gods alongside God”?' he will say, ‘May You be exalted! I would never say what I had no right to say

So the Qur'an mentions the Trinity a couple times, but this is the only time it specifically identifies a triad of ""Christian"" deities, and it identifies Mary as one of them.  Muslim apologists sometimes argue that the Qur'an is not here identifying the Christian Trinity, but is denouncing belief in Jesus as God and is also denouncing the veneration of Mary as a saint.

----

The Qur'an also reads (*9:30*):

&gt; The Jews said, 'Ezra is the son of God,' and the Christians said, ‘The Messiah is the son of God': they said this with their own mouths, repeating what earlier disbelievers had said. May God confound them! How far astray they have been led!

Of course, Jews do not believe Ezra to be the son of God.  Some Muslim apologists argue that this verse simply refers to some unknown sect of Jews who held this belief (rather than all Jews).

----

As for the myth of Jewish male menstruation, the story is rather grim and brutal.  In the Middle Ages, Christians came to believe that Jews required Christian blood; specifically from children.  Jews were accused (and murdered) on the charge of ritually killing Christian children for their blood.  This is known as the blood libel, and the charge swept through Europe (and beyond).  Christians also devised reasons for the desire Jews had for Christian blood.  Supposedly it could be used by Jews as an aphrodisiac, to decrease the inordinate amount of pain Jewish women were believed to experience during childbirth, counter a Jewish smell supposed to afflict all Jews, etc.  It was especially common to believe that Jews crucified a Christian child every Passover and used his blood to make their matzah.

It was also believed that Jews needed Christian blood for a very specific reason: to alleviate menstruation in Jewish men.  Why would Jewish men menstruate?  Well, if all of womankind were cursed with menstruation and weakness due to Eve's transgression, then surely the Jews (who had killed God) would be cursed as well.  Christians turned to Scripture for proof of this.  At the trial of Jesus, the New Testament claims that ""all the people [Jews] answered, 'His blood be on us and on our children!'"" (*Matt. 27:25*).  In the Latin Vulgate, Christians read, ""And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: he put them to an everlasting reproach"" (*Ps. 77:66*).  These and other verses were used as proof for God cursing his enemies, the Jews, with menstruation among their men.

In a Medieval account of a Christian man and his Jewish lover, the woman says she may only visit him safely on Good Friday evening.  She explains:

&gt; I am very much loved by my father who guards me so carefully that I cannot come to you nor you to me except on the Friday night that preceeds your Easter. For then the Jews [that is, Jewish males] are said to labor under a certain infirmity, which is called a bloody flux. They are so preoccupied by this that they can only pay less attention to other matters.

We see here the myth of Jewish men menstruating.  When are they menstruating?  On Good Friday, of course, the anniversary of when the Jews murdered God.  And what can be used to cure this affliction?  Jews use the blood of Christian children, which is a reason why Jews are accused of ritually murdering and consuming a Christian child every Easter/Passover.

As Medieval sciences grew, Christian scientists provided scientific backing for the curse of menstruation which afflicted Jews.  Much of science was related to humors; with specific attention to types and quantity of blood.  All of the inferior traits identified in women were related to their humors, and they ultimately were required to discharge a certain amount of blood through menstruation.  Jewish men were identified as possessing those same inferiorities and the same disposition as women.  Jewish men are cursed to menstruate through hemorrhoids and have lost their masculinity.

Bernard of Gordon, a Medieval professor, writes in the 14th Century:

&gt;  Jews suffer an immoderate flow of blood from hemorrhoids, for three reasons: generally, because they are in idleness, and for that reason the melancholic superfluities are gathered. Second, they are generally in fear and anxiety, and for this reason melancholic blood is increased, according to this [saying] of Hippocrates: ""Fear and timidity, if they have a lot of time [to work], generate the melancholic humor."" Third, this occurs as a divine punishment, according to [the text], ""And he struck them in their posteriors and gave them over to perpetual opprobrium.""

8 is the number of new beginnings.

The eighth day is always the start of a new week.

Jewish boys are circumcised on the eighth day.

Or my favorite... David.

Samuel was told to take a ram’s horn full of oil and anoint the next king of Israel. At the time Saul was king, he was the people’s choice and he started ok but that whole thing didn’t end well. 

Samuel shows up at Jesse’s house, from the tribe of Judah. Samuel asks for Jesse’s eldest son and the dude comes out to Samuel. Sam thinks this must be the next king but God tells him no. God reminds Samuel that He doesn’t look on the outward appearances, God looks at the heart. Samuel asks for Jesse’s second son. He is rejected as well. As is son three, son four... all the way down the line through son seven.

Do you have any more sons? Samuel asks Jesse?

One more, he isn’t worth anything, he’s out back tending sheep.

Bring him please.

And they fetch David. Samuel anoints him with a rams horn full of oil (Saul was announced with just a vial of oil). David... the line of Jesus, His lineage runs through the house of David. Both Joseph and Mary... the only person who has legal documented claim to the throne of David is our king Jesus. David is called a man after God’s own heart.

173,fzqbmh9,Jewish men are effeminate. Jews control the mental health industry. Hmmm. Could they be trying to remake us in their image?
174,ff02u1i,"I don't watch TV much so I don't know but I have heard this stereotype in general that Jewish men are gay, perverted, effeminate, or conspiracy theories that ""The Media Jews"" are promoting homosexuality and brainwashing men to become gay, or they make men do gay favors to get an acting job or media career"
175,fdo165g,"&gt; [...] As for academia being more feminized, I think it’s more a result of 5 decades of relentless indoctrination by the left, which dominates the social sciences. Most professors of social sciences remain male and Jewish. Jewish men are much more effeminate, over sensitive and verbal than men of any other race. Being hysterical, easily offended, highly emotional, vengeful, punitive, lacking in self-restraint…all are Jewish characteristics. And these characteristics have now infected all of academia. Both male and female SJWs are equally capable of meltdowns and snowflake behavior.

&gt; Our young men and our colleges are not feminized, they are Jewified. The US is now a Jew nation, no longer a Christian nation.

176,ehs5td1,"This reminds me of that one time TERFs were claiming that trans men were flocking to Judaism because all Jewish men are effeminate academics, apparently, and it was therefore much easier to be a Jewish man than a “real” man.

"
177,e11wghg,"       “Besides the odd way of talking and the proneness to diseases of the nervous system, there were several physical traits considered to be typical of Jews and simultaneously to indicate the effeminacy of the male Jewish body. The first criterion was the alleged shortness of the Jews. According to a study on the physical characteristics of the population in Galicia published in 1876, Jews were much shorter than Poles and Ukrainians. Another author, Arkadius Elkind, reported in an article in 1906 that the average Polish Jew was as short as 1,610 mm, which was far below the average height of the Poles.
       “Another indication of the effeminate Jewish body was the short arm length. A standard scientific procedure among anthropologists was to compare the distance between the outstretched arms to the overall body height. Normally, the length of the outstretched arms exceeds the body height. With Jews, this was not the case. Heinrich Singer, for example, stated in his 1904 publication on the diseases of the Jews that with outstretched arms, the distance between the tip of the middle fingers of their left and right hands was 4,3 cm below their height. This was considered to be further proof of the distinct body of the Jews. They were much shorter than non-Jews and had shorter arms (just like women who were believed to have a similar body).”

       “There were some physical characteristics which kept people out of the army and were thought to be “typical” of the Jews. One of them was a “narrow chest”. Jews were deemed to have a chest size that was below its average circumference in the population at large. In 1876, two anthropologists undertook a study on the physical characteristics of the population in Galicia. Among other things they measured the chest size of Poles, Ukrainians and Jews, and reported that—on average—it amounted to 843 mm among the Ukrainians, 831 mm among the Poles, and only 794 mm among the Jews. Other examinations leading to similar results can be found in publications by Bernhard Blechmann or Heinrich Stratz. Jews, as it seemed to be clear, did not have the body that was required to serve in the army.”
I think Jewish men are often seen as less sexually desirable due to the things mentioned above, the genetic disorders, you know all of the consequences that come from centuries of inbreeding, poor eyesight, narrow heads, weirdly shaped noses, high pitched voices, flat feet, proneness to disease, etc, etc. 

   However, their lack of sexual success being the main factor in their hatred of whites and other races for that matter, doesn’t seem right. They make up for it with their money and their power. People like Harvey Weinstein bang Aryan princesses often but that doesn’t quell their hatred. 

The Jew being weak and ugly makes them feel like they can’t survive in nature so they wish to manipulate, dominate and control. They have an allergy to the natural order which is why they struggle with gender identity and perform oral suction circumcisions and blood libel and horrible animal slaughter techniques. They can’t live off the land or in nature unless they use us to provide them with resources and they still hate us in the same way a parasite tries to kill its host.

Also I don’t think we can make Jews feel “adequate” I think it’s impossible. For example the Evangelical community supports Jews tremendously but Jews still have very low approval ratings of Evangelicals and other Christian denominations. Also America has been Israel’s greatest ally in the past 20 years at least but it’s alleged that Netanyahu said
 “If we get caught they will just replace us with persons of the same cloth. So it doesn’t matter what you do, America is a Golden Calf and we will suck it dry, chop it up, and sell it off piece by piece until there is nothing left but the World’s biggest welfare state that we will create and control. Why? Because it’s god’s will and America is big enough to take the hit so we can do it again, again and again. This is what we do to countries that we hate. We destroy them very slowly and make them suffer for refusing to be our slaves.”
It’s alleged he said this in a private conversation, but even if he didn’t this is probably how he feels about America anyways even though we have provided almost everything they ask for.

Maybe it is ""Jewish brains"" able to manipulate the West into fighting their battles, but let's face it Jewish men are about as effeminate as it gets. Israel is widely regarded as the undisputed gay capital of the world."
179,f9sjoas,"You're accusing people of making claims that weren't made and objecting with facts that are irrelevant to what was said.

Fact: Jewish men are very disproportionately represented among board members and executives of financial institutions worldwide.

That fact isnt saying that Jews are conspiring to manipulate markets.  That's an assumption some people make because it confirms their existing prejudices.  

It's also a fact that Jewish people have higher IQ on average than european white people.  The alt-right types like to omit that fact when pointing out how many Jews are executives at financial and media institutions."
