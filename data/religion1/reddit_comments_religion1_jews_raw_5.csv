0,g0okstk,"OK, so if this were strictly or even majority populated by Americans, I would sadly not be surprised. However, this community does have a fair amount of non-American members. So as a result, I am extremely surprised and very saddened that my answer hasn't already been mentioned.

I was going to simply say, Genital Mutilation, not specifying Male or Female, since in my opinion AND anatomically; both are completely unethical, destructive, and forced upon the mutilated. But since someone already pointed out FGM; then, as a member (no pun intended) of the mutilated majority of American Men, and in an effort to maintain gender equality, and dispel Misandry, I feel it necessary to point out the disgusting state-sponsored and Industry-sponsored practice of Male Genital Mutilation AKA Male Circumcision, or specifically Routine Male Infant Circumcision (RMIC).

Additionally, the condemnation, dismissal, and outright gaslighting of the Intactivist movement and the feelings of those who do feel that they were violated. I was violated by the doctors and nurses who delivered me into this world. Those same doctors obtained informed consent from my parents. Under federal US law, this is actually null, since parents may only give consent to life-sustaining or medically necessary procedures upon their children. Legally this is known as proxy consent. As a result, only the individual can consent to any procedure upon their own body. This would ensure that the individual's bodily integrity remains intact. Furthermore, to qualify as informed consent, the information should be unbiased and portray the pros and cons equally. Even though I question the legality of parents’ rights to consent to this procedure, assuming that parents do have the right to consent, when any health care provider, regardless of their position (Obstetrician, General Practitioner, Emergency Physician, Anesthesiologist, NICU nurses, Labor and Delivery Nurses, Social Workers, etc.), intends to obtain informed consent, ethically they must present the pros and cons of each side, showing no preference toward either. To show even the slightest preference could be considered a violation of ethics and potentially malpractice.

Providers should not expect the parents to do their own research, even in this age of the internet where the likelihood of parents having done the research already. It is universally understood that providers are experts in their respective fields and as such we have a valid expectation that we can trust any advice given to us by providers.

Parents (who regret their decision on their own or from feedback from their sons) and medical providers (who also regret their actions) have revealed in print, that consent; especially during the decade that I was born (the 1980s); was anything but informed. Typically this involved extremely biased support of performing the medically unnecessary procedure with little or no discussion to the opposition for the traumatic and needless procedure. And that's if any consent was obtained at all. It's been recorded by some parents that they were never asked or told that their son was cut until the hospital staff handed the parents their son after the irreversible surgery was already performed. Another blatant violation of ethics. Your son's body is his own, as a parent, he is NOT YOUR PROPERTY and you can not do whatever you please to him. And the same goes for your daughter's.

But girls are already protected by law in the United States. Under United States federal law, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is illegal nationwide. This is regardless of any consideration of cultural or religious beliefs. To create some sense of balance, and since the idea of male circumcision being considered Male Genital Mutilation (MGM) in the US is blasphemy, I’ll call both circumcisions, to make a point that whether it’s the same or not is irrelevant.

Where the surgery is covered by Medical Assistance (depending on the state/commonwealth) and is promoted by the National government's disease research and prevention agency (CDC) both within the US and abroad (HIV Prevention policies in Africa) which equates to state sponsorship. And private insurance covers the surgery without question, even though they place extreme scrutiny upon medically necessary procedures that would actually save someone's life, and of course, a baby boy can't really protest, can he? If you want supporting documentation, please let me know and I will be more than happy to provide some recommended reading.

I wanted to add a few things. First, MGM is the most common medically unnecessary surgical procedure in the US.

Second, because of independent research done by the parents, the number of MGM done is dropping and, I might add, without any recommendations or input from providers.

Third, there is a deficit in the education that doctors have received, at least in the past, where the anatomy and physiology of the intact penis are completely unknown to these doctors. This is evident in a few ways: an enervation map that I saw in an anatomy and physiology textbook did show an intact penis but also showed that the nerves stopped abruptly where the foreskin begins. Another example is the misunderstanding of pediatric phimosis. During the surgery, the provider will take a thin metal probe (like a really thin bar), insert between the infant's head and foreskin, and uses it to break the natural adhesive that keeps the foreskin attached to protect the infant's penis. This normal attachment is called Pediatric Phimosis. Unlike the phimosis that might occur in older children or adults, pediatric phimosis is intentional, natural, and required. If the child managed to escape the knife there is still the risk of still being harmed by the provider if the provider forcibly retracts the foreskin all because of a lack of education. There are even clothes or patches made instructing any provider to not retract the foreskin. The adhesive attaching the foreskin is the same adhesive that keeps our fingers and toenails attached to our fingers and toes. This adhesive will also naturally dissolve once the child goes through puberty.

Fourth, I can't speak to anything in Islam, but a number of Jewish parents are opting out of putting their sons through the Brit Milah (the ritual circumcision of Jewish boys to welcome them into the world. Instead, these parents are opting for the Brit Shalom which has all the same rituals but without the cutting.

Fifth, being an Intactivist or just being against MGM does not make you an Anti-Semite. I myself have Jewish heritage and a good number of Intactivists are Jewish mothers.

Last, to have FGM be illegal, which I support, and to not also ban MGM is not only sexist but is also a blatant violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment."
1,ffsngbt,"You ready to go full speed ahead to crazy town?

&gt;Instead, she opted for “a “gentle bris” ceremony with alternative ritual  objects: a pomegranate, a gold kiddush cup, and a large ceramic bowl  filled with water to wash the baby’s feet, an ancient act of welcoming  the stranger.”

[https://www.kveller.com/jewish-parents-are-starting-to-think-twice-about-circumcision/](https://www.kveller.com/jewish-parents-are-starting-to-think-twice-about-circumcision/)

The above example is far, far, far away from the normal."
2,f7iolfi,"Not redundant, more and more Jewish parents are opting out of circumcision altogether (check out brit shalom)."
3,f241z6e,"NTA- and many jewish parents are against circumcision nowadays, look up the  intact jewish network"
4,f24r5ot,"im sorry but YTA. It is not maiming. its not even dangerous.  If it was circumcision wouldn't exist at all. and no, he will not have difficulty masturbating. trust me. I honestly have no idea where you got your information bc its incorrect. 

Her family is jewish and she was raised jewish which is why she never brought it up as it wouldn't occur to me either until its time... and then bam your jewish parents are in the room. you probably need to get over it and not be so squeamish. or take it to your grave, whichever suits you"
5,f2pn0im,"It's definitely not just you, it seems a significant chunk of the population is not only completely ignorant when it comes to what circumcision actually does to a penis they seem to know nothing about how a penis works generally. I'm not even just talking about sperm or anything but how an erection actually happens and they believe all kinds of bullshit which often seems to be completely made up by the pro-circumcision types.

Like you point out as well the most avid pro-circumcision women out their purely seem to be trying to shame men into getting it done because they think it 'looks nicer'. I have to wonder how many of them really believed that or whether or not they're just arranged, it goes back to the old flip the genders argument. If someone is thre type to think it would be horrifying to say that about a woman's vagina and think it's totally okay for a man's penis then they're complete hypocrites.

Contrary to popular belief there are millions of men who do just fine with their penis uncircumcised but their seems to be a weird propaganda movement online to make it out that having a penis circumcised is somehow 'unnatural'. I can only imagine the amount of pressure Muslim and Jewish parents are under to get it done to their child when it's a completely unnecessary procedure and of course it seems to be a thing amongst American Christians too.

I give you credit for having the sense to do your own research on the topic rather than just listen to all the bullshit out there. One of the most fucked up things I've seen online are these mothers ranting about how they're getting their sons dicks circumcised because it 'smells', for hygiene and these are just children. They're inflicting bodily harm on their own kids purely because they're too lazy to scrub more or if it's a woman generally over sexual preferences."
6,eof66qa,"I get that. My feelings are circumcision are that I just don't like it. Obviously, I'm not Jewish. I feel like I am disrespecting someone else's beliefs, but I just don't agree with cutting part of a baby's penis off. If a grown man wants to when he's older, it's one thing, but removing the foreskin of someone who has no say in it is difficult for me to get my head around.

It is true that more and more Jewish parents are deciding to forego circumcision. I'm guessing that's probably not a preferred topic in a subreddit about Judaism."
7,ens2o10,"I said Jewish-born babies because the article in question seemed to be referring to babies born in developing countries that were at risk of contracting HIV, whereas most Jewish children are born in first world countries where acquiring such a disease is unlikely. I am aware that other cultures practice circumcision, my vendetta is against is male child genital mutilation."
8,dx3bw4p,"&gt; Circumcision has to take place on the 8th day after birth.

That's not true: Judaism accepts adult converts all the time. 

Also, lots of Jewish parents are keeping their kids intact: http://www.beyondthebris.com/

9,dtkh1i7,"Circumcision is an act of violence against a helpless individual. It is designed to impress the victim with his lack of choice in life. A circumcised man in a Christian country loses his chance to be a normal member.

Since many Danish women don't like the idea of circumcision, Muslim and Jewish parents are disqualifying their sons from having Danish women lovers, girlfriends and wives.

That is a bad start in life in my opinion."
10,dtkzpyg,"&gt; Since many Danish women don't like the idea of circumcision, Muslim and Jewish parents are disqualifying their sons from having Danish women lovers, girlfriends and wives.

I'm 100% against infant circumcision. My husband is Jewish and circumcised. He's agreed we'll never mutilate our sons.

You fall in love with the person, not the penis."
11,du7ubbm,They can indeed but denying your child circumcision means you're denying him jewishness and god's love. Not many Jewish parents are gonna stand for that
12,druik2x,"&gt;Jewish tradition considers male circumcision obligatory. It is typically done on the infant’s eighth day out of the womb and is performed by a mohel, someone with special training in the procedure....But an increasing number of young Jewish parents are opting out of circumcision, calling the tradition outdated or invasive."
13,dkyeubx,"And he can look up Brit Shalom...this is a legitimate Jewish naming ceremony and it doesn't involve circumcision.

Jewish parents are not required to circumcise their sons."
14,dls3wwn,"Increasing numbers of Jewish people are deciding not to circumcise their sons even in Israel. A well-researched article in the newspaper Haaretz (June 2013) reports the results of a survey conducted in 2006 which found that while nearly 5 per cent of respondents had not circumcised, fully a third (33 per cent) of parents would have preferred not to circumcise; they were persuaded by fear of social pressure. The greatest anxiety is about the reaction of relatives, especially grandparents. 

The “Jewish circumcision,” is performed by a mohel who is not necessarily a doctor, and always without anesthesia. This is an invasive and brutal act – cutting the foreskin, and retracting it from the membrane that separates it from the glans, sometimes with a knife and sometimes with a fingernail. These are tissues that are full of nerves. 

According to Jewish law, a Jew is someone born to a Jewish mother and circumcision does not determine that a person is Jewish, and non-circumcision does not determine that a person is not Jewish. There were periods and communities in Jewish history in which circumcision was not practiced – from the days of ancient Egypt up to the Communist bloc. Moses was opposed to circumcision and didn’t circumcise his son, and the Children of Israel crossed the Jordan into Canaan uncircumcised.

Brit Shalom (covenant of peace) is alternative ceremony that many Jewish parents are doing instead of a Bris. 

At this Brit Shalom, the parents washed their son's feet (Brit Rechitzah) instead of circumcising him, as a sign of the Jewish covenant and welcoming, and gave him his Hebrew name.

Welcoming ceremonies for Jewish babies without cutting have shown three strands:
The original ceremony is reinterpreted in the light of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac; as in that case, a substitute cutting (not of the baby - of his clothing, for example) may be made.

The ceremony is reinterpreted in the light of the Holocaust. That was suffering (and marking*) enough.
* It was a terrible thing for adult Jews to be marked by having a number tattooed on their arms; how then can it be a good thing for baby Jews to be marked by having part of their penises cut off?

No reference to the original ceremony: the parents promise the baby that, among other things, they will never hurt him.

As well as the physical advantages to the boy, Britot Shalom/Shalem/Milim

They are equally suitable for welcoming girl babies. They can be performed without causing heartache to parents, especially mothers.

15,fuoahw4,"There’s a stereotype about young Jewish women being “JAPs” (Jewish American Princesses) and basically being spoiled brats because Jewish parents are more likely to be wealthy doctors or lawyers or whatever. Like Rachel Berry from Glee, or the main character in Marvelous Mrs Maisel, or Rachel Green from Friends to a lesser extent. But the stereotype was more prevalent like 60 years ago and definitely doesn’t apply to 30something year old Jewish men."
16,fxznkai,"I find that most Americans have no idea where anti-semitism does come from &amp; I actually think it would be helpful to combat the casual anti-semitism that is still so prevalent. 

I’m not by any means an expert but I can give a little background:

-Most anti-semitism is rooted in really old shit. The ‘Jews are good with money’ shit? That comes from a time in Europe when Catholics were legally barred from lending money, so it was the one job Jews were allowed to hold. 

-Plenty of ugly stereotypes come from us being painted as ‘the devil’ or ‘Jesus killers’ (like the horns &amp; whatnot). 

-A big one that is still very popular with the far right crowd is the ‘puppet-master’ conspiracy. Jews are a tiny fraction of both the world &amp; America’s population, but we are very well represented in business &amp; media &amp; culture etc. this (&amp; like actual Hitler nazis) have led to a perpetuation of an idea that we ‘pull the strings’ on society &amp; manipulate the masses to our benefit. The Jewish community &amp; Jewish leaders were heavily involved in the civil rights movement (it is considered a responsibility of our people to support the oppressed against their oppressors) which led to the more modern version of this theory which is both about media but also promoting acceptance of other races &amp; all that stuff that neo nazis don’t care for. 

That last point is why we will *always* be enemy number 1 to the nazi types. They may hate African Americans, Latinos, Gays, whatever, but they blame the Jews for those groups having success in the first place. 

Jewish children are taught to be vigilant about these things because our ancestors dealt with often escalated versions of the same shit. I never realized until adulthood how valuable that education I so resented as a kid truly was."
17,ewkjzup,Jewish culture is the opposite in that regard. Jewish parents are frugal. They also look down upon professions that don't require education.
18,dyo2vy1,Your Jewish parents are pretty frugal with their genetic material huh
19,e523yh1,"I've always thought the reason fobs are dicks is because of the system they come from back in asia. At least in china, as part of the ww2 revolution they executed a majority of the rich or educated people. Basically it became a country of lower class. But in any system the bell curve exists and some people will become successful. Successful enough to break out of their environment. In a society of 1.5 billion people, the one percent is 15 million people. If they were all in america it would be like 1 in 20 people. Imagine 1 in 20 people so baller they could buy every house on your block. 

So when they come here, they're used to being in an ultra crowded place where you have to push and shove just to get your share. But they're the lucky ones so they were somehow able to be more aggressive and get even more. My theory is they see those name brand materials as the requirement to help deal with that chip on their shoulder that they came from humble roots. A starving person who can go to a buffet every day still remembers they were once starving in the back of their mind.

Driving is kind of similar, they came from a society where nobody knows how to drive. The only way to get anywhere is to sit in traffic for hours and take every inch you can get. Imagine trying to zipper merge 40 lanes into 5, if I yield to this guy then I might wait another hour before I have another chance to move forward 1 car length. That's what shit is like in China.

And getting to the ad hominem attacks, if she can only bitch about how pointlessly expensive their shit is and the accent then her imagination is pretty small. As if no other culture ever told their daughters to marry rich dudes. Indian and Jewish parents are especially known for this exact suggestion to their kids. She could clown on why winnie the pooh is banned for days. Or why girls can't eat bananas in a erotic manner in china. In turn I could make fun of american culture for example nobody in asia worries about buying their kids bullet proof back packs. Unless I suppose it's made by Chanel, then they might need one in every color. But hey I've never heard of asia having any neo nazis, no surge in people saying whites men can't be racist, or kids eating tide pods.

Before yall down vote me to hell, I'm a cali born asian who lived in asia while my dad was stationed there. I've seen a few different sides of the coin."
20,fxkke1j,"The Third Reich left a deep scar in the world. Germany doesn’t deny the Holocaust, but they did prosecute their war criminals either. The allies did that, but Germany did not enforce the prison terms. So many war criminals who were not executed were sent home, and they raised families. 

Antisemitism remains a very real problem in modern Germany. Not just the alt right. The Jewish community is very small. Less than a million Jews live in Germany. Parents caution their children not to tell their friends that they are Jewish. Jewish children are often bullied in school. Administrators try to blame Muslim immigrants, but they are not in charge of the schools. The bullying is allowed to continue. 

Germany seems destined to lead the EU. They have the strongest economy. They are an industrious people, but they remain morally unfit for leadership. 

I was hopeful when Merkle attempted to lead Europe in the acceptance of Syrian refugees. That sort of thing is precisely the sort of thing required to heal the wounds of history because it’s the opposite of what the Third Reich stood for."
21,g0c4h83,"Thread is full of fallacies and the mindset although understandable is plain wrong.

22,e7lzd8a,"The intersection between Chinese and Jewish culture is very interesting. I did some reading about it a while ago, and it seems like it can be traced back to similar values and the joint immigrant experience, especially in NYC.  That's why mahjong is so popular among Jews and we eat Chinese food on Christmas (that and all the other restaurants are closed).  Plus, the stereotypes about Chinese and Jewish parents are very similar, valuing education, having very high standards, encouraging music, etc.

It seems this happens quite a lot in immigrant communities.  I grew up in Tampa, FL and there are joint Cuban-Chinese restaurants.  Some have split menus and others have fusion cuisine, like fried rice with plantains. "

&gt; If the amount of effort that Asian and, to a lesser extent Jewish, parents are putting into early childhood academics has no effect then I would be very surprised.

Shared environment contributes [approximately 0% variance to adult IQ](https://jaymans.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/iq-heritability-age.png). So its certainly not 'culture' as in shared culture amongst an ethnic group. Hmmm, what else besides culture is shared amongst an ethnic group I wonder?

25,did3y3b,"&gt; Are the natural or adoptive Muslim parents now or less fit than the Sikh or Hindu or Jewish parents? Are two Christian parents who suffer mental illness or struggle with alcoholism better than sane and sober parents of a different religion? Is a Catholic couple better or worse than a Protestant one? Baptist or Anabaptist? Your church, or another church?

i think culture should play a part, to an extent; because we need to note the realities of the world. for example, for a 12 year old immigrant from Egypt, who has spent their childhood going to a mosque, praying 5 times a day, and is deeply entrenched in that culture, a muslim couple would obviously be the ideal. not some cast iron rule that bans any other potential carers than muslim ones, but they should be at the front of the queue. once you get into religions that aren't as associated with an ethnic/cultural foundation, that would become less important. similarly with a lesser age child; i.e. a 2 year old who had christian parents who went to church at Christmas and Easter... intuitively it's not that big a deal if they get christian parents or not. on the other end of the scale, a 14 year old muslim boy who is theologically conservative and engages in discussions during the weekend at his mosque about why same-sex activity is sinful; probably isn't wise to give him a gay couple as foster parents. "
26,dr4yz01,"Thanks for all the citations. I think you did a good job of showing that at least *some* sources are including network effects and access to wealth and power, along with looking at outcomes. I'm still not convinced that those privileges are close to the core of what people are trying to get at when they discuss white privilege. It's is a core premise that *every* white person has white privilege, even if they don't have every privilege that every other white person gets. So that's where I see your argument breaking down. Plenty of poor Jewish people don't get access to the Jewish privileges you described. If you can show some Jewish privileges that poor Jewish people have access to, I think your argument would be a lot stronger. Because I can give you a really long list of white privileges that white poor people do get for free.

It seems to me like you're arguing that the kids of successful and / or wealthy Jewish parents are privileged. I wouldn't argue against that, but I couldn't extend it to a more generally named ""Jewish privilege"".

&gt;  would argue that the lengths of the list of privileges are probably less important then the privileges themselves. 

That's an excellent point. But again, I would still have to see at least some Jewish privileges that poor Jewish people get for free just by being Jewish.

&gt; Unless we believe that white women or African American men and women are inherently less capable, we have to acknowledge that our systems are treating us unequally.

I think this is a key point, because American Jews do have an intelligence advantage. ""As of 2017, Nobel Prizes have been awarded to 892 individuals, of whom 201 or 22.5% were Jews, although the total Jewish population comprises less than 0.2% of the world's population. This means the percentage of Jewish Nobel laureates is at least 11250% above average."" Wow!

It's not popular to discuss race and intelligence, and I do not believe that blacks have lower than average IQ.

However, **90% of the Jews in America are Ashkenazi Jews**. Ashkenazi Jews have *much* higher IQ than the average person. The empirical evidence is overwhelming. A lot of Einsteins in that group, including Einstein himself. And it's not hard to argue that the Ashkenazi Jews who immigrated to America during WWII were the most intelligent and / or most successful of an already gifted group of people. US immigration policy did not let in all Jews at the time. Not even close. Scientists and other highly intelligent people who could help us win the war were certainly given priority. What we have in the US is the smartest of an already very smart group of people.

I don't think this leads us quickly into racist thinking about ethnicities.

Jews make up only 1.7% to 2.6% of the total U.S. population. It's an extremely small group of people. A group that is actually a little larger and includes non-Jews and could be more accurately described as ""people with high IQ"". What we are really talking about here is IQ Privilege.

I could go on to explain why the outcomes for blacks are far more attributable to racism rather than an IQ differences, but that's a little off topic.

It's a touchy subject, and I hope I've handled it with some sensitivity. But I think it's clear that ""Jewish Privilige"" is not an unearned advantage extended to every Jewish person. And it has little to do with being Jewish. You those privileges by being smart."
27,dine1c5,"&gt; Barack Obama received a lot of criticism from Republicans for being too soft when it came to protecting Israel.

Both US Dem and Republican bow down to Israel, Obama didn't cut any arms deals or stop droning terrorists hostile to Israel. It was mostly just politics. Ethnocentrism has nothing to do with Republicanism anyways, there is just some overlap in immigration policy ideology.

&gt; Don't most groups network with each other? I lived in Utah for a few years and I observed that business was kind of tough for non-Mormons just as a natural consequence of not having an automatic network and community.

If you lurk around alt-right bubbles enough you'll find plenty of anti-Mormon sentiment as well. That said, Jews tend to stand out because their ethnic nepotism tends to be focused particularly in industries that have tremendous influence (porn, music, media, politics, academia). Jews are &lt;2% of the US population. Look at any large universities humanities faculty and you'll see they are significantly over-represented. Do the same for literally ANY media outlet etc.

&gt; So, why is this a bad thing for Jews and not for other groups?

It's true that ethnic nepotism is pretty much unavoidable, but Vietnamese nail salons, Korean dry cleaners, and Gujarati Liquor stores don't have the same influence that AIPAC, SPLC, CNN, BBC, MSNBC, NYTimes, literally every single Rap record label etc. have on public discourse. Furthermore nobody is saying it's inherently wrong or bad that Jews have this over-representation, but the ""war on noticing"" where they are ethnically clustered is problematic. Imagine a parallel universe where Hindus were 2% of the population but 40%+ of Media op-ed writers and talking heads. Would you be wrong to be more skeptical of India-Pakistan narratives? 

&gt; For me to believe what some of you have asserted here, it is almost as if I have to believe that there is a group of influential Jews... That just seems like such a stretch . . .

It does appear that way, but most people aren't actually saying there is a cabal of Soros types sitting in a dark room planning to fuck the world up. I allude to this in my comment here but again:

Jewish culture is essentially an origin story based around endless persecution. Jewish children are taught to always be wary about the next shoah. The crux of the argument is that this has a (probably subconcious) effect of Jews preferring multicultural societies because if they aren't the lone successful minority they are not the focus for the ire of the majority. This will generally cause them to prefer multicultural policies and third world immigration to places that are not Israel (it can't be stressed enough how strict they are re: immigration into their homeland. interfaith marriages are illegal in Israel for example). 

The ""problem"" arises if you accept HBD as reality, as most ""alt-right"" people do. Third world immigration is explicitly detrimental to white people. I try to avoid using personal anecdotes in these discussions but to use my home country (Brasil) as an example, you can literally judge the safety of any region based on how white it is. People here posit that this is not a coincidence. 

And so, Jews having a massive nepotistic Media, Arts, and Academia industry that consistently advocates for multiculturalism is inherently detrimental to white peoples' safety. The fact that they won't advocate for this extreme multiculturalism in what they consider their homeland is just icing on the cake.

Sorry for writing essays, and note again that I'm fairly low on the anti-semitic scale compared to the average here, but I don't think any of my thoughts about inherently controversial - in fact their plainly observable. 

One has to ask why saying the Viets are overrepresented in the nail salon market is mostly uncontroversial but stating that Jews are overrepresented in Media and Academia is ""anti-semitic"". There is a social stigma being enforced on noticing this and it merits discussion.

Lastly, sorry for writing long essays, this isn't really my favorite alt-right topic but I'm trying to flesh it out as best I can.

31,ec3vjus,"Basing my understanding on many discussions over the years with Catholic friends, I would say that there are some commonalities in terms of concerns about sin (not surprisingly given the common sources) , but that the greatest differences are in terms of psychology.  Jews tend to be less preoccupied with the issue and, in particular, with the fear of Divine punishment.

Concerns with Salvation from sin (Original and otherwise) are pretty central to a religion that conflates God and the messiah, a figure who, contrary to the Jewish understanding, is designated as a soteriological figure, i.e. one who saves from sin.   The Jewish worldview, which sees other mechanisms for forgiveness (e.g. Temple sacrifice, repentance, Yom Kippur) and which does not associate the messiah with salvation from sin, does not have such a centralized focus on the matter.   Jewish children are not threatened with hell nor taught to see themselves as inherently sinful--the Jewish view of human nature is not one of depravity but rather of a potential, and an ability, always to choose between right and wrong, good and evil, and to do *teshuvah* (""returning"") when one has missed the mark."

33,di99ers,"&gt;The fact that you are trying to insinuate that Jews have a ""genetic predisposition to psychopathy"" is objectively antisemitic and you are starting to show your true colors. 

Right they have a genetic predisposition to being schizoid, aspergers etc. but we have to rule out a genetic link to psychopathy? Has it ever been studied?

Funny how when scientists look for ""the evil gene"" in white murderers nobody cries ""racism!"".

&gt;You already brought up ""bad karma"" for past actions, yet now it is wrong for the ""Jewish communists"" to get back at the people who commit genocide in the first place? 

Yes Jews practice collective punishment (against Palestinians, Germans etc.) while at the same time complain about their own past collective punishment.

&gt;I have spoken with many Jewish families that were not so lucky and life wasn't any better for them because they were Jewish, in fact they still regularly endured persecution.

Probably after Stalin took over. Jewish doctors tried poisoning him so he was mad about that.

&gt;You clearly have some strange vendetta against Jews.

Or you hallucinated this. I point out crime where I see it, whether done by Jews, muslims, freemason pedophiles, satanists etc. All groups complain about the ""vendetta"" they hallucinated I have against them. Maybe these groups should try not committing crimes if they don't want people pissed off?

&gt;I don't know if a Rabbi touched you inappropriately or what

Well if I was Jewish the odds of that would be high. Seriously in one community 50% of Jewish children are molested by the elders according to one estimate.

&gt; but this mindset can't be healthy.

Do you find people still listen to you when you say ""hi I'm Jewish and I'd like to police everyone's thoughts, that meme is a virus!""

&gt;On board ship to America, the Jew Freud did not feel he was bringing America a new panacea. With his wretched Jewish wit he told his travelling companion, “We are bringing America the plague.”

46) We will allow Hezbollah (banned terror org) in the Quds Day march calling for the destruction of Israel (the only march solely aimed at calling for the destruction of another country) but only the political wing.

47) Jews culturally appropriated every staple of their diet.

49) The Jews killed a Palestinian for no reason when he was on his way to visit his sister (shares video of terror attack he literally just attempted with his car).

50) Sharing a picture of anti-Zionist orthodox Jews doing something terrible saying ""This is the true face of Zionists.""

35,f6vi39y,"As a fellow jew, that's decent.

But why don’t Jewish cannibals like eating Germans? They give them gas.

Alternatively:  Two Jewish children are sitting on top of a roof near a chimney. A  passer-by asks, ‘What are you doing there?’ ‘We are waiting for our  parents.’"
