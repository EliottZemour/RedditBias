1,fa3e05h,"Well, it´s not about the 'normal' Muslim but what you call 'normal' to be a minority of orthodox Muslims who, nevertheless, respect a country´s secular laws and customs. The great majority may even appear to do so but under the counter they work fiercely on the Stealth Jihad:
First let´s remember that in the Islamic orthodoxy, apostasy, i.e. leaving Islam, is punished with death according to Sharia and even when the family itself and the friends don´t do it, they are always at risk of being targeted by the fundies and get ostracized by their own family members, a devastating experience for all who dare break free:

Sex Abuse Pervasive in Pakistan Islamic Schools
Just an excerpt from the text in English from the page of the video (there seems to be no subs available)
""Sexual abuse is a pervasive and long-standing problem at madrassas in Pakistan, an AP investigation has found.
But in a culture where clerics are powerful and sexual abuse is a taboo subject, it is seldom discussed or even acknowledged in public.
It is even more seldom prosecuted. Police are often paid off not to pursue justice against clerics, victims' families claim. 
Cases rarely make it to the courts, because Pakistan's legal system allows the victim's family to ""forgive"" the offender and accept what is often referred to as ""blood money."" 
The AP found scores of reported cases of sex abuse within a far-reaching system that teaches more than two million children in Pakistan.'

""Secret video footage reveals Muslim preachers exhorting followers to prepare for jihad, to hit girls for not wearing the hijab, and to create a 'state within a state'.

&gt;Over 700 acid attacks yearly, is an issue. 

Don't know where you got that number from. Stats for London are available, but full data for the rest of the country is not. The actual number is likely a little over half of that, but 700 a year is an inflated number either way. Granted they're horrible, I'm not denying that. I am denying that they're as widespread an issue as you're making out.

&gt;Cool America has issues with their gun violence. They also have a population nearly 6x that of the UK.

Even adjusted for population, the homocide rate in the US is 4.5x bigger. Population doesn't even come into it.

&gt;Sure do, although I have been told that it is just shit 'old people say'... 

How is listing a number of pages about sex abuse  *convictions* proof that it's being allowed to ""thrive due to police fears of racism""?

&gt;When you account for differences in spelling of Mohammed, it accounts for over 1000 more people than Oliver

Until you take into account the differing spellings of Oliver as well, which that BBC article didn't do so wasn't comparing two of the same thing. Besides drawing conclusions about anything from that is pointless. Muhammad ranks high because muslim parents are far far more likely to name their baby Muhammad than anything else, whereas in the rest of the population there is a much wider spread of names. Its not an indicator of anything else other than that. If you want to comment on the muslim population (because that seems to be a problem for you), then quote the population statistics rather than baby names.

&gt;Your biggest march was against a foreign allies leader visiting because you don't like him? 

It was the largest at the time. Many of the issues you're rightly mentioning (although incorrectly inflating) are due to massive government cuts. Particularly policing cuts. We're constantly told that there is no money, but the government will suddenly shift around £1 billion to buy some Northern Irish MPs votes, or spend £14 million on a state visit that the people of the UK don't want! And before you claim that the protests just added to that bill, his visit cost £10 million before he even landed so it's unlikely it raised it by a significant amount. It's not just about Trump, but he is extremely unpopular in the UK and we didn't want him here even if it was free, let alone it costing millions of pounds that apparently doesn't exist.

&gt; Shows how much you care about real issues facing your country. With Brexit going on, and everything else, I do in fact find this quite sad. If this is all your depressed population can muster, you have more issues than I thought. 

Do some fucking research. Since then, the march for a second Brexit referendum occurred and was four times larger. Prior to that, we had protests over government cuts in 2011 that equalled the size of the anti-trump protest. The anti Iraq war protests in the early 2000s were also larger.

&gt; Robinson (or Stephen as you may call him haha) has received many death threats from Muslims.

Sadly that's a part of being a public figure. Whilst I don't believe anyone should be facing death threats, I struggle to sympathise when he specifically goes out of his way to spread hate to the point where he [influenced a terrorist attack which got someone killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson_\(activist\)#Actions_relating_to_Finsbury_Park_terrorist_attack).

&gt; Robinson was specifically moved to the prison with the largest number of Muslim inmates in the U.K. when he was known to be a controversial figure to Muslim inmates.

It's widely known that claim is false. Yaxley-Lennon's ""manager"" made the claim to Alex Jones, claiming that his old prison in Hull was a 2% Mulsim population (it's actually 7%) and that his new prison was 71% muslim. No prison in the UK has a 71% muslim population. It was never released which prison he was moved to, probably because it either didn't happen or because you'd then be able to put a figure on it. [Source.](https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/tommy-robinson-moved-muslim-prison-14786200)

&gt; I suggest you watch his interview with Tucker Carlson. You may be opposed to it, but it was an interesting watch for me.

Watched the start. I'm not going to waste any more of my life listen to him pretending he's the victim, when a tiny bit of research shows that most of the stuff he says is false and it wouldn't surprise me if the rest is. Besides, he's likely going back to prison at the end of the month anyway.

&gt;Not anymore (as of around 2020-21). Parents can no longer opt out. 

Your source is old and wrong. [Link to the actual consultation report from February 2019.](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/relationships-and-sex-education-and-health-education) Page 17 - ""We recognise, however, that parents are the primary teachers of their children. That is why parents will be able to request that their child be withdrawn from the
sex education element of RSE.""

&gt;This also depends what you refer to as sex education. I believe it to include teaching 4 and 5 year olds about gay and transexual relationships.

Great, we're working towards a more open and inclusive society. Gay marriage is legal in the UK and has been for years, I can't see how hiding that from children does any good.

&gt;It is compulsory, and indoctrination of children.

Teaching children about relationships that occur in the country is not indoctrination. It's a conservative government implementing these, who are at the opposite end of the political spectrum to a government you'd expect to implement them. That just shows how out of touch you are with the country you're criticising.

&gt;Over 100,000 people signed petitions to stop this, however your government decided it is appropriate to dictate what concepts are introduced to young children

That's a tiny amount for a government petition, a recent one got 5.8 million. However you say that they didn't listen, yet I've linked you to a consultation that they did on the matter so it looks like they did.

&gt;You may think this is good, but I believe it to be appalling.

You don't live here, so your view on it is irrelevant.

&gt;I hope you don't think my comment was bullshit.

No you had even more bullshit in this one than the last."
4,el79hlu,"Screw this psychopathic bigot and her fellow snakes. She's spent a lifetime hating Islam and Muslims, selling herself out to the Islamophobia industry and spewing relentless, rabid hate against Muslims, which has shown itself capable of having very real consequences, the recent New Zealand terror attack being one of the countless examples. Here are some gems from her Twitter handle:
https://mobile.twitter.com/brumbyoz/status/1107976129296490497

Here she says 'Muslim children are trained to belt a bomb and blow themselves up'.
https://www.oneindia.com/india/taslima-nasreen-controversy-islam-muslim-children-boys-bomb-blasts-terrorism-1877209.html

Muslims don't need lessons on how to lead life from such incurable haters. Muslim women, in particular, don't need lessons from anyone on what to wear. It's their goddamn choice. Everybody from housewives to college students to Ph.D scholars to Olympic gold medalists to a US Senate Representative proudly wear a burqa or a hijab. It's *their* choice. It is THEIR CHOICE. NOT yours. Theirs alone. It may seem ridiculous or even obnoxious to you, but it's still *their* right. NOT yours. What part of that exactly is hard to understand? 

Of COURSE, nobody's suggesting that people be forced to wear anything. That's plainly wrong. But, being 'truly secular' doesn't mean forcing your choice on them, which is exactly what such phoney secularists tend to do. Forcing someone to *not* wear something *you* don't like is equally bad as forcing them to wear something you *do* like. 

A wide variety of Muslim women, from the average ones to the highly accomplished ones, are shouting from the rooftops that they're *not* being forced to wear it. That it is *emancipating* for them. That it's a part of their *identity*. That it's a matter of belief, culture and *pride* for them. And that it doesn't stop them from being every bit as empowered as any other woman in the world. And yet, the 'truly secular' hypocrites pretend not to hear a word of it. 

Their agenda, you see, has never been the good of Muslim women. Their agenda has always been to end Muslims and wipe Islam off the face of the earth. Much like the New Zealand terrorist who killed 50 innocent people last month. 

It's time people stopped falling for the deceptive rhetoric of hardcore Islamophobes like Nasreen. 

Granted Muslims have a lot of flaws. A HELLUVA lot of flaws. But, point to me a community of 1 billion plus followers that's *without* massive flaws. Is the global Christian community without its flaws? Is the global Hindu community without its flaws? The drive to push the change needed to better the social and political conditions of such gigantic communities can only come from a place of genuine care and struggle for justice. It can and will never come from hate."

9,dtnql8l,"Religion plays little part in modern geopolitics.? Osama Bin Laden sent two planes into the World Trade Centres, that lead the West into a multi-trillion dollar War on Terror. IF China was in that situation, I doubt they would have invaded Afghanistan. Is that pandering? No, its being smart.

 China prior to the Communist coming to power, have used religion to legitimize their ruler over minorities whether the rulers were Han Chinese or Mongols/Manchus.  Why do you think they often assigned Muslim (Hui Muslims) to govern Xinjiang? Why do you think Qing Dynasty Emperors were called protectors and patron of Buddhism by the Tibetan Buddhist.

It is not about pandering to Islam.  Outside Xinjiang, since the reform period, China has pander more to Muslim / Islam than the West has. Whether its support for minority languages, the building of mosques etc.  

It is not about pandering but being smart. In Southern Thailand, almost every year about 300-400 people are killed due to attack by Malay Muslim insurgents. Most of the victims are civilians.  But the Thai government has never called those insurgents ""terrorist"". Why? Because once you call them terrorist it will attract the attention of foreign Jihadist groups. One rule in counterinsurgency don't create more enemies than you have to.

It is interesting that you didn't read my links about Aceh.  The Dutch fought a war in Aceh that lasted from 1870-1905, a conflict that resulted in over 100,000 dead. Eventually, they pacified Aceh, how? Read the link. 

As a Singaporean, I just think the Chinese government is not pursuing the right policies in Xinjiang, and this is not speaking from a Western viewpoint, but Singaporean. How come Singaporean hasn't had a major terrorist attack since 1960? Well, one factor is the police and the fact that your family could be liable if a family member comes under the influence of Islamist propaganda. So people do report their family members if they are suspected of reading ISIS propaganda on the web. IF that happens the person is sent to an Imam for counseling.

But in return, Singaporean government is very sensitive to Muslim concerns. Muslims men in Singapore are still allowed to have more than one wife in Singapore, and it is legally recognized. Singapore has Syariah courts for family matters. Muslim children are enrolled in religion classes etc. 

Its a give or take. "

My grandma and grandpa, who believe that Muslim children are terrorists at birth just because they're Muslim. They believe that black people are inherently lazy. They believe America is a Christian country.

My dad: He believes gay people are inherently sinful and wrong despite having no control over who they are.

My old friend Austin: an actual fucking Nazi. He believes gay people and Muslims should be externinated, and every other race including trashy white people should be placed in concentration camps. Only non-trashy white people are allowed to be free. He believes Hitler was a good guy, believes in Nazi ideology, and reported his ex girlfriend for child porn (of herself, which he himself willingly accepted) just because she broke up with him.

Bob: Genuinely good person, believes in fairness for everybody.

The people I know on the left:

Dakota: Transgendered, wishes she could use the bathroom of her choice and wishes more people would be concerned about trans rights. Believes bad people exist on every side of the spectrum.

My friend Rylan: Hates pretty much all Republicans, thinks Trump should be assassinated.

And you can offer thoughts and prayers without typing it into a reddit comment

I don't really see anything wrong with this apart from the whole Muslim children, why specify what religion; are u trying to say only Muslim children are at risk and that's why u care or are u trying to say any child's life isn't as valuable as a Muslim child's (normally I'd think the Muslim part was just because this was perpetrated by Muslims and retaliation would lead to this but when it comes to Islam the alternative view points sound more and more viable).

&gt; I am so tired of this. My condelences to the families of the victims. This will end when there are more Muslims in the FBI and Interpol who have a vested interest in preventing these attacks from happening. If not for my injury I'd be among them.

Isn't that the exact opposite of what will happen. If even one Muslim who get's into the FBI or Interpol becomes radicalised they could single-handedly destroy the government (especially in high level positions); planting a bomb at the base of presidents chair when he asks to talk to u or checking underneath the prime-ministers car only to place a discrete tracking device (for nefarious purposes). Any member of a religion that has a history of radicalising members shouldn't be allowed to hold a high government office.

With all due respect, it is about dead kids. I'm not saying that you want to see more dead kids, but that given the choice between more dead kids and censoring the internet to stop Islamic extremism, more dead kids is considered the lesser evil. 

&gt; Allowing ourselves to censor speech for any reason grants precedent that it's ok to censor speech

Has speech ever been free? Besides, we're talking about the UK. The UK doesn't have the same freedom of speech laws that the US has, and for very good reason: it's a monarchy.

&gt; After all, terrorists hate us because we aren't Muslim, and we don't obey Islamic law.

As an exmuslim, let me be the first to tell you that that's bullshit and deep down you know it is bullshit. Terrorists hate you because you have a pulse. They hate Muslims and non-muslims alike, although statistically an argument could be made that they hate Muslims even more because most of their victims are Muslims. Not even countries with sharia are immune to Islamic terrorism (see Pakistan and Saudi Arabia).

&gt; I wish Muslims would join the backlash.

Given their general opposition to terrorism, they probably won't be joining the backlash. I was reading about the mother of the Manchester bomber and how she was too ashamed of her son to even want to claim his body. I should imagine that a lot of Muslim parents are so terrified about their kids being radicalized that they would much rather see the internet and radical imams being censored than to risk losing their children to a death cult."

18,dhuhug7,MUSLIM PARENTS ARE BECOMING HEALTH TERRORISTS AND DESTROYING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BY DELIBERATELY FATTENING THEIR KIDS IN ORDER TO CLAIM DISABILITY PENSIONS
19,dhaxt96,"Sexual assault and the ""rape crisis"" is almost entirely propaganda, there's little evidence that immigrants (or refugees, in this case) commit violent crimes at higher rates than the native population. Yeah the Koln incident was awful, and it's a difficult topic for liberals because it feeds into far right talking points, but in general it's not indicative of a wider pattern. That's why I think it qualifies as scapegoating. People like Trump and Le Pen paint chaotic pictures of their societies and try to pin the blame on minority ""outsider"" groups, especially Muslims, when that just doesn't square with the reality that violent crime is trending down and the Western world remains the safest place on earth, ever. In a way I think that explains the hysteria to some degree, because we find terrorist attacks so shocking.

&gt;Also, Christianity isn't committing anywhere near the same degree of atrocities that you see in ISIS controlled territory or Saudi Arabia. It's just not happening.

Do you not see the double standard here, though? Every Muslim I know *despises* ISIS. And the primary victims of ISIS are... other Muslims. That's why it would be just as absurd to blame Christian extremism (say, Anders Breivik) on Christianity in general. ""Islam"" isn't the problem, extremism is. Now, Islamic doctrines may make its various sects more *susceptible* to extremism than other Abrahamic religions, but we're still talking about a vanishingly small number, proportionally speaking. And like most religions, its followers are mostly decent people who pick and choose what they want to from the text for a variety of social, cultural, educational and other reasons. I still think religion is a net negative, and that most religions encourage backwards morality, sloppy reasoning and create a focus on a non-existent afterlife to the exclusion of the real world. But I also believe in freedom of religion, and trust that the vast majority of religious people put up with some kind of cognitive dissonance, which has allowed religion to mellow out as society has progressed. The second generation of Muslim children are more liberal than their parents, there's no reason to think that trend won't continue. Integration is the solution in this regard.

&gt;I think getting real and critical of the negative parts of Islam is necessary.

So do I! But blaming everyday Muslims, most of whom are *cultural* Muslims with varying degrees of devoutness, is not only unfair but counter-productive, because we know that, cognitively, it will make the handful of nutcases double down in their beliefs.

&gt;coddle a toxic ideology

I agree, but again nobody is suggesting we should ""coddle"" anything. We should, however, be tolerant of whatever batshit nonsense people want to believe in until the point it harms other people. You can cherry pick bits of any religious text and call that faith a ""toxic ideology"". Political Islam is a problem, but multiple approaches are adopted to deal with it in Europe. There are all sorts of ways to deal with Islamic extremism which don't involve demonising Muslims as a group, and imo they're more effective. One of the biggest additional issues is that ""Islam"" is not a monolith. How do you decide who is and isn't a Muslim? Because not even Muslims can agree on that. 

&gt;Until they reform

Again, I just don't think it's fair to characterise a group in this manner. Who is ""they""? Some Trump supporters said extremely racist shit at their rallies - and don't Trump supporters get annoyed when people call them racist based on that? It's exactly the same thing. "
20,dhbjrrp,"I have to disagree. If one were to fully educate themselves about Islam and defend it, these turn out to be the terrorists and the Islamists. If Most Muslims reject the backward practices of Islam as you says, that's thanks to the educated, plural West.

I wouldn't be so sure about conquering an Islamic invasion. A part of the problem is us as liberal, overly tolerant Brits who have welcomed the most barbaric practices and views in the world. The big mistake has already been made I think. Of course we can try and be 'resilient' with our values but against the overwhelming tide of a rapidly rising Muslim birth rate (where most male Muslim children are being named Muhammad) and the future is looking depressing. Plus not many people stand up for civilised values anyway in fear of being called 'racist'."

Both of which are untrue, the vast majority of Muslims don't agree with ISIS and other paramilitary groups just as most Christians don't agree with the KKK and other regressive groups with Christianity as one of their main core beliefs. It's really a no brainer that his blanket portrayal of Muslims is probably wrong and grossly unfair on the vast majority who don't believe that at all"
23,fdq7bar,"There's a lot of small things, e.g. halal food everywhere, censorship of ""islamophobic"" comments, schools in bad areas where non-muslim children are bullied and beaten, ...

But personally I don't mind all of Islam's values. Islam is right about women, after all ;)

My main problem with the growing is Muslim population is that a lot of them hold non-Muslims in contempt and see them as lesser beings, all non-Muslim women are viewed as whores etc. Muslims are vastly overrepresented in violent crimes like random stabbings or rapes and I think the disdain for infidels plays a part in this. 

On top of that you have the terrorism.

All in all, I think Islam is a violent, totalitarian ideology that needs to be removed from Europe. Either by deporting the people or by re-educating them (similar to the Denazification after WW2 we could try a Deislamization)."
24,eyq7mrx,"They just found a “quick fix” to terrorism. The statement “war on terror is hard to win” is only true if you exclude the option of eliminating the whole ethnic culture. What China is doing is like nuke the whole Middle East to destroy ISIS.

They do hate religion though. All churches are required to be registered, and religious missions are illegal outside of those registered buildings, which means Christian and Muslim parents are not allowed to make their kids believe in their religions."
25,dih3cev,"Yes and no. ""Depriving them of legitimate grievances"": 

* isn't always practical or possible (since many want Israel annihilated - that is not going to happen)
* won't necessarily work: many of these radicals have mental issues, or are thoroughly vile, violent people (just look at what ISIS *did* in Syria - ""feeling aggrieved"" doesn't justify the rape, torture and murder perpetuated there)

What needs to be recognised is that there are well-funded religious organisations that dislike and seek to change the status quo, when it comes to gay rights, women's rights, children's rights, secularism and host of things. It is incompatible with their religious philosophy, which requires striving towards a pure Caliphate (analogous in many ways to extremist US christians and the ""Rapture"").

The sad and paradoxical fact is that we actually need to *enforce freedom*. (Censoring the internet is the reverse of this).  This basically means enforcing secularity, and making private religious beliefs and choices a matter for the home, not public life.  By all means celebrate Ramadan, Christmas and Diwali with banners across the streets. But don't ban things because they ""offend"" one group or other, whether that's gay marriage, an advert for contraception, pork, whatever.

 * We need to ensure that all Muslim children are getting proper educations (in my view we need an complete end to all faith schools, and strict monitoring of home schooling): **children should have a basic human right to a free, secular education that allows and encourages critical thinking**.  
 * We need to ensure that Muslim women and girls are treated equally, and that Muslim men and boys *are taught* to treat them equally.
 * We need to ensure that migrants and refugees are taught English so they can fully participate in society, and not be forced into cultural segregation

By the way you can substitute ""Muslim"" for any religion you like here, there are other groups that are problematic in many areas. However currently in the UK and most of west, terrorism is predominantly coming from Muslim groups. It's rather foolish not to acknowledge this."
26,ftet9tt,"Me too except it was my step dad. He acts so nice in front of others but the second he comes home it’s a warzone. It’s like he was 2 completely different people. Other kids would tell me how cool he was and how they wished he was their step dad. But little did they know he was a terrible person. He would scream at my mom and abuse my siblings and I every day. He would also “check me out” which is a fucking disgusting thing to do. Him and my mom always used the threat of divorcing each other after every single fucking fight and he would storm out of the house and apologize promising not to do it again, acts nice the first day or so after coming back, then goes back to abusing us until my mom finally divorced him 5 years later. My mom is also toxic and emotionally manipulative and would tell me that it’s my fault my dad left us and I should be the one who makes an effort in making our relationship better even though he doesn’t give a shit about my siblings and I. I noticed that a lot of religious muslim parents are just so fucking toxic. All they care about is their reputation and how others view them but don’t give a shit about their kids."

But otherwise, rebel, and she’ll eventually get used to it and stop expecting you to do ridiculous shit for her. It worked for me."

It is really disgusting that your mother would rejoice over the death of an innocent young boy.

The first idea is that they threaten secularism. Maybe it starts with demanding prayer time at workplaces or something small. But countries which become majority-Muslim tend to start seeing more religious laws. 

The second idea is that countries are bound to become Muslim-majority. Muslim immigrants flow into non-Muslim countries and have more children than the locals; Christian and Buddhist-majority countries tend to have stagnant/aging populations. 

The third one, which I believe more than the first two, is that Muslim communities tend to be exclusive clubs. The Muslim people frequent the Muslim-owned businesses; the Muslim businessmen work together; the Muslim parents are strict af and only want the Muslim women to date+marry within the faith. I've had Muslim friends in multiple countries, but I'm never a close friend. Ideally this self-segregation would start with FOTB and reduce over time, but I currently live in a country where some of the Bengali families have been inter-marrying for over a century."

&gt;Cherry picking poorly translated individual verses out of context and misunderstanding them is very different from understanding the message the Quran is trying to convey.

OK. Hopefully the imams on those Jumu'ah will follow your example and tone down on the anti-jew and anti-kuffar messages on their sermons.

There are cases where Jumu'ah sermons in Indonesia threaten muslims not to vote for non-muslims governor candidate, or they will be treated as non-muslim as well. And they use Qur'an verse 5:57 as justification.

There is also cases in Singapore where an imam recite prayers that include ""God help us against Jews and Christians"". He was later brought to court and apologize, but it does indicate he truly believe what he said when he said it.

There are many other cases of such hateful sermons in many countries, even in countries like Germany and Britain where muslims are not the majority, that make people really question if Islam really teach enmity to jews and non-muslims or not.

There are also documentaries that investigate what is being taught on islamic schools in Britain, and they found the messages being taught to muslim children are very anti-west, anti-nonmuslim and they are being taught to look down on western civilization, to look down on western people as godless people and to think that they are better than that.

34,e11ce9t,"This is beyond retarded. You haven't done anything wrong. My Muslim parents are pretty religious, and even they wouldn't have a problem with me snooping around in temples for the sake of tourism. Your call, but you'd be better off without them. If they can threaten to disown you over such a thing, what's your relation with them anyway? "
35,dh7cyq5,"Your girlfriend's parents will dominate your relationship. Not because they're muslim, because your girlfriend will let them.

You're being asked to lie about your religion for the rest of your life to appease them. Your wants, and hers, will *always* come second to her parents. 

What if they threaten to disown her over parenting style, how many kids you have, where you live, how you spend your money, how you spend your free time, where you vacation? What if they decide your (presumably non-Muslim) parents are a bad influence on *their grandchildren* and demand you cut them out? Your then wife will demand you give in.

Check out /r/justnomil to see what life is like when your spouse puts their parents before you.

It's also a red flag that she intentionally dates non-muslim guys and asks them to convert to a religion they don't really believe in.  She doesn't want a Muslim lifestyle, she wants to live a lie. Major dishonesty is *not* a good thing in a girlfriend. What will she end up lying to you about? Why would you expect her to be honest with *you* when she's comfortable living a lie?

36,fnc6acl,"It's tough from a sibling's perspective because religious parents get to indoctrinate their children with all this religious mumbo jumbo, but I feel it would be unfair for us to intervene and tell our siblings otherwise. Muslim children are raised so one-sided and warned against questioning their religion, and given the same ""Allah knows best"" spiel in the event they do question anything.

You could try telling your parents that she should understand the surahs she's learning, not only because it could help with learning but also because of the emphasis Islam places on actually learning and understanding Arabic. If they agree, you could then say that you find that particular surah quite violent and that she maybe shouldn't learn that one until she's older. I think that would be less suspicious than just straight up saying that the surah is too violent, but you obviously know best. I would say to avoid saying anything altogether if you think it'll get heated and that you might blurt out something you'll regret. 

Also, please bear in mind, that it may not go as you hoped, and her understanding the surahs could actually lead to her actually adopting some of its out-dated and dangerous principles, which may be worse than her blindly reciting the surahs. Equally, if your parents cherrypick the surahs, she could grow up thinking Islam is completely different to what it actually is.

Ultimately, putting all this responsibility on yourself can be very stressful. Just remember, so many Muslim parents brainwash their kids, and yet there's this community of us who broke free anyway; It's difficult to control how people think and respond to things. I do wish you good luck, and hope everything goes as you hope."

38,ejbac5q,"Nice! Attacking my character.

I never mentioned atheism, only you did. You seem dishonest, putting words in my mouth. But we are different. You think that's ok, and I don't.

But yes, they should be forced to accept some basic western values.

In sweden we have huge problems with honour driven violence. 2/3 girls of muslim parents are subjected to their cultural and religious oppression according to a fresh report. Made to marry people they don't want (often because the parents find out she's dating someone they disaprove of), controling what classes they take, what people they see on their spare time, made to wear sertain clothes, hitting them and terrorize them to act in accordance to their beliefs.

These are values that doesn't belong in 2019. The same goes for not harrassing lgbt and people who leave the faith - which is dangerous unless you have money to move to a town where you have no extended family.

You can keep atheism from the conversation since it doesn't add anything. But less religion = better society. There are some good reports on that too, connecting religiousness to social ills.
There is nothing positive brought by christianity or islam that make a society richer, because what is good about them isn't uniqe, and what is uniqe is not good.

So what do we have? People with values that should have been left behind and Sweden has learned from the misery that came with just letting these people keep their values as is and has changed course towards esucating them in ""proper values"". This has given promising reaults and we are taking baby steps towards a better situation. Child marriages is also a problem that we're trying to solve.

Yes, they should change. I really, really think they should be made to change - because the consequences of the ideas and values are very real and so far from positive in human life.
I have brought up the majority opinion among muslim immigrants (nothing against immigration, we need it to make our wellfare work due to low birthrate and aging population) and ofc there is variation. But it is variations of bad."
39,dxpbgpa,"&gt; But the issue still lies with how we would empirically implement rules across different groups once we acknowledged that they were different. That seems like it would be really ugly really fast. Say we adopt a legal definition of Asian Americans that includes them being of higher average IQ, and furthermore we note that to do nothing is to ensure inequality. What rules could we change that wouldn't inherently create groups that are privileged/handicapped due to race or ethnicity?

I really don't think there is a good answer to this, I certainly don't have one anyway. But I think we need to remember racism can and is happening on both sides of this conversation. Nazi Germany is the perfect example of how a society can just as easily discriminate against a group of people for being ""superior"".

If there are groups who will always naturally fall to the top or bottom of the social-economic ladder then we have to decide whether we either want to accept that, or whether we'd prefer to treat people unequally in an attempt to overcome some of the natural advantages / disadvantages some groups might have.

I'm pretty libertarian minded so the idea of trying to force some kind of social equality based on genetics really bothers me. It's why I am very much opposed to the ""progressive"" type of sexual and racial discrimination we implement today. I'm personally okay with women earning less than men, or Asians and Jews earning more than whites (like myself). I rather not go down the ""too many Jews in positions of power"" route in the name of equality, although worryingly we seem fine as a society saying ""too many white men in positions of power"" today. 

If there is no right answer, I think our best option is simply to  acknowledge life isn't fair. In my opinion the only solution is to to create more homogeneous societies, but that's easier said than done. I don't know where you're from, but in the UK I really don't think we've done ourselves any favours by having so many different communities living so extremely differently to each other. Large inequalities are arising here from the extreme cultural divides of multiculturalism alone. One example is that Muslim women are much less likely to work for example, so Muslim children are almost certainly not going to be raised with the same financial security that white children are. Then when you compare that to the work ethic of some East Asians it's just obvious Asians are going to be over represented in academia regardless of genetic differences.

As for racial differences, I don't have a good answer. I think having a reasonable rate of immigration is one obvious answer though. Racial issues that have long been part of American history are now popping up all over Europe where previously they never existed. I think the UK would benefit just letting people mix for a few generations so these differences aren't quite as obvious. I'm ethnically mixed, but I see myself completely as British. If I was low IQ and struggling in life I wouldn't be able to say it's because of racism because I see myself as British. But something I've noticed is that people born in the UK who are for example 100% ethnicity Indian will see themselves as Indian not British. This isn't ideal because that allows them to group themselves differently and in turn more likely question whether their individual circumstances are what they are because they are part of that group.

I think while we say we like diversity, human history would suggest we probably don't. Perhaps we have learnt our lesson and this time it will be okay, but I honestly think we play a dangerous game with human nature in our current multi-cultural / multi-ethnic societies. You just have to look how divided we are politically and socially by race to see how this isn't a healthy situation we find ourselves in today. I guess the good news is in time with globalisation the genetic diversity between population should hopefully start to disappear, but in the mean time if these differences are real and significant enough in our societies perhaps it's just inevitable that the far-right will exist and continue to suggest we discriminant against minorities, while the far-left will continue to suggest we discriminant against those who naturally rise to the top.if these differences are real and significant enough in our societies perhaps it's just inevitable that the far-right will exist and continue to suggest we discriminant against minorities, while the far-left will continue to suggest we discriminant against those who naturally rise to the top."

I don't see how finding the common ground of other people ""having arguments"" for mutually exclusive positions should convince someone of anything.

I also don't see why arguments you have that convince you should be excluded. It's actually a common atheistic trope to exclude ones self from an attack on reasoning in general while directing it at theists.

&gt; But it does contextualize things. It gives me pause

""Giving pause"" doesn't seem meaningful. Evaluating evidence afterward might be, but that would exclude basing arguments on where a belief comes from.

If you follow that reasoning further you should suspect everyone is wrong, hence that's just an attack on reasoning itself. Are people slaves to their upbringing or are they not?"

&gt; The Muslim Council of Wales defended their decision to invite Dr Godfrey-Faussett to speak at the event which they said was to provide ""information and guidance"" on the proposed changes.

&gt; It said it was ""reassured that she is committed to respectful and accurate dialogue on the sensitive topic of sex education in schools"".

&gt; ""There should be no question that LGBT communities in Wales should be free to live and love whom they wish, without fear of attack, censure, or abuse.""

She then goes on in the linked article to say:

In this society people can do whatever they want, and no one should face bullying in any way but people of faith – Muslims, Christians and Jews – are all speaking out on this issue.

As an LGBT person, I disagree with her personal conservative views on families and hierarchy, but as an observer of the coverage it is clear that Muslims are being disproportionately targeted for holding small c conservative views in this way. 

I also find it a little ironic that the example we're enshrining and celebrating here is a speaker being cancelled by a university for having views people were opposed to.

47,di8hp0j,"but if you admit that it is illogical, how can you follow it with peace of mind?

it doesn't really matter if those ""beliefs"" are radically different from your former ones, science doesn't care about your feelings, so there is only truth or non truth.

i can not answer that question. because i've never met anyone who would talk to me about religion like that, not even close friends. i do not know where you are from, but here in europe it certainly isn't normal to talk to your friends and family about your religion, even if you all follow the same one. so i wouldn't know how people are treated by their families especially not related to religion.

what i can say for sure however, is that i felt very forced to be christian by my family. they raised me that way and when i made it clear to them that i didn't believe in any of their fairy tales they did the best they could to convince me, ending in them being very sad about it. as i see it forcing lies on other people, especially when they are vulnerable kids, is against the human rights. there is no way to make up for something like that, so i just want my parents to be punished for what they did, which is why i don't miss a moment to remind them of what they did and for which reasons i hate them. and i don't have the tiniest bit more compassion for any other religious people. do you know how it feels to gradually realise the world you've been raised in doesn't exist? that you been pressured into wasting your time and energy with prayers, that you asked some deities for help when you had problems in school that might've been solveable, or that you had to participate in events you don't like with people you don't like, because your so loving skygod would be very disappointed if you didn't and when you realise what you did all your life you wonder how it could've been different if religion wouldn't exist. how much better it might've been. i doubt you know that feeling, but maybe you'll experience it too one day if you ever realise your religion was a lie.

mind you, what christians consider religious here in europe is a watered down tradition, with some beliefs sprinkled on them. not anywhere near as extreme as it's practiced in say the usa. atheism is at an all time high and only rising around here and christianity becomes less important by the year. so when something as weak as european christianity can make a kid feel bad about themselves, how about something like islam? whilst christianity has been decreasing here, we get more and more muslims, of varying degrees of religiousness. it took us centuries to get christianity to a state where it's somewhat acceptable, and now islam takes it's place. i'm not even talking about laws. if you had a talk about religion with a christian person here, they would be very humble, maybe even admit that religion has little to no place in modern day. whilst most muslims seem to take anything that's against their religion as a personal attack and react accordingly. so if a ""weak"" religion can be that indoctrinating, how about such a potent one.

i don't care much about how i'm treated, neither related to religion nor otherwise. i also don't want any redemption for what happened from my parents nor anyone else. what i want is to make sure that no other human has to feel that way, and that will only be possible when religion doesn't exist anymore. i know that what happened to me, might not even be noteworthy to you, but i wouldn't want anyone else to go through that. to be honest i wouldn't need any other justification for my hate against religion, but i've talked to quiet a few people who have suffered from religion far worse than me, which is more than convincing. and if that's not enough for you, then you can always look into a newspaper and see what kind of stuff people have been doing lately with the motive of religion.

i do not say that muslim children are brainwashed, i say that all religious children get brainwashed because it's the only thing their parents know. religious people can't raise children without brainwashing them. what i mean by brainwashing is to give untruthful information to them. as a child i spent countless hours watching science channels, yet it still took me years to notice the inconsistency between science and religion, can you imagine that?

why are only muslim children called out for getting brainwashed? oh boy, seriously from which country are you? usa? i honestly can't think of any other one where you could be, especially after you said you aren't from a majority muslim country. it certainly can't be anywhere here in europe."
48,dh2xtqw,"Can parents enroll their kids to Montessori classes ?

Can parents give their kids broccoli ?

Parents decide on behalf of their children dozens of times, routinely, everyday.

One of the most vicious angle of this hateful cultural attack is the insidious insinuation that Malay Muslim parents are somehow stupid idiots who torture their children.

Is that really true ?

Use your brain and think. Use your intuition. Are those parents really torturing their children ?

When those parents do that, what are they trying to do actually ?

How come their voices are not being taken into account.

How come only the voices of Westerners, Islamophobes, and feminists are being taken into account ?

This female circumcision is basically a tradition, a culture, a heritage, a religious practice. It is to symbolize modesty.

It's just a small snip which removes a small part of the clitoral hood.

This female circumcision is often done by a female Malay Muslim doctor. The mother often have had that done herself. So the mother pass down the practice to her daughter.

Do you realize that this hateful propaganda is very disrespectful to thousands of Malay Muslim mothers, doctors, and women ?"
49,e7lark4,"I will await you to consult google again before your response. You know nothing, but you also try defend a religion that promotes murder, slavery, not teaching women to read and write or have education, female circumcision,  brutal murder of homosexuals while simultaneously keeping young boys around as sex slaves. The Western world stopped allowing their major religions to do horrible things hundreds of years ago, it is time Islam catches up. In many downtowns throughtout the Muslim world suicide bombers are thought of as heroes because they killed innocent men women and children, their families are treated like royalty. In Israel, Muslim children are taught at age 6 and older to carry out knife attacks on innocents, while the Jewish population that is in control of the country allow Muslims to go to college, be part of the government, do you think the Muslims would offer Jewish children the same boons? No, they would slaughter the infidels until the blood was knee deep."
50,dunkdkr,"&gt; Don’t lie because the truth will come out. What’s wrong with being too busy to go, or maybe just get out earlier for lunch so they can’t capture you.

Yeah I am not going to lie that leads to all kinds of problems. Being too busy to go seems to be fine until I am always busy. We will see though. They won't ""capture"" me or anything as they won't know exactly where the office is probably. There are multiple office building on the intersection. Also Prayer times are not always during lunch where I am. usually a bit after.

&gt; Congratulations on your relationship. I am living with and engaged to a non Muslim lady so I know what Muslim parents are like!

Thanks. I had gone years not in a relationship and it seemed like every time I went to my parents house I would get bombarded with questions about when I might want to get married and such. The moment I told them, I started getting questions about her religion. For a while I just said we never discussed it."
51,dr5npz1,"Ok, I might made a fast and wrong assumption, I thought with your first kinda rude comment that you’re a sunni extremist, hint why all I mentioned is based and is clear that is targeting those groups. So forget about that, my mistake.
Anyway, if you are worried about muslims which I trust that you are, and you ain’t a shia hater nor sunni extremist, then I honestly don’t see how your comment is valid, and how can you be fooled by propagandas. 
Burma is one of the most places where muslims are being persecuted, tortured, abused and killed in the worst ways possible. Palestine is one of the most places where muslims were being abused and killed with cold blood. Yemen muslim children are starving to death under KSA invasion and siege. Hundred of thousands of muslims in Syria were killed on and on by another sunni based ideology with all the graphic content they keep on releasing consistently. Hundred of thousands of muslims died due to Iraqi invasion in 2003 and nothing but destruction and chaos happened after their invasion. Most of the dead are among sunnis.

As for Hezbollah, the only arabs militant party to win vs Israel, three times, if you count the 2017 Syria win as a win over Israel. They did get into the war mainly because of two things, and they did join after everyone joined from each country, even though that Hezbollah would’ve been the first to be affected by a regime loss. ISIS purpose was clear, they wanted to add Lebanon and Jordan under their state, which means their goal was clearly targeting  us, all of us in Lebanon, and as we are capable and are threatened, along with more than 10+ suicide bombing in our country targeting mostly Shia, we fought for our survival and our existence. As a person who know hundreds of those who fought and some died or injured in Syria, I know what morals these fighters have, and what kind of war they did fight, they never killed a civilian on purpose, they never targeted innocent people, never tortured other fighters, never killed a prisoner. They fought vs ISIS which was being medically aided by ISREAL. Period. All the propaganda around it is now clear for many people, it is definitely obvious how much of an impact ISIS would’ve had and did have on our region, actually in the world. Btw, do you see dead people anymore? Do you hear about suicide bombers? Do you imagine what is it like if Hezbollah, Iran and Russia didn’t get into the war? Let this sink in.

Do you know how much of a slaves our arab world would be to Israel and the US if we didn’t win the war? And could anyone even disagree with the recent capital change in Israel? Please, look at the bigger picture, and look around you, who is controlling the media, who is in control of this huge media war that is probably more difficult than a traditional war.

Look around you without biased views and you’ll see that Hezbollah although they ain’t saints and many would fall to some humanitarian mistakes, are actually the good ones in the whole thing here, or let’s say at least, the best between all the bad around."
52,dnarz3c,"Well the reasoning is quite a complex issue, but I believe it boils down to 3 main points.

01) They pity those being blamed for what's beyond their control I.E. extremism (even though they don't understand Islam is by nature extremist). I suppose u can interpret this as meaning, they feel Muslims are a regressive minority and therefore like you would treat a rare animal that's been cornered they try to defend it because it's just a consequence of it's upbringing (like if someone got angry at a monkey throwing it's faeces at u).

02) The stigma of Islamophobia, makes them correlate attacks against Islam in the same light as attacks against Homosexuals (homophobia) or other such people; ironic seeing as Islam is quite clear in how to treat homosexuals, find the nearest building and throw them off it. Suffice it to say, with the wave of people  coming to the defence of oppressed minorities, once they lose anything to fight against they desperately try to find something, anything that needs their help. Cause let's face it, anyone who's PC has just got a really bad case of the Hero complex.

03) There's no real middle-ground. You're either for Islam, on the side of free speech and free expression, or against Islam, on the side of the far right and bigoted loonies. Until people can realistically see that there's a problem with Islam and that it needs to be addressed, no-one can really do anything. The majority of Muslims keep claiming it's not their fault and has nothing to do with Islam and people just take the at their word and avert their eyes from what Muslim children are being taught; they're being told if they don't be good Muslims or if they leave the faith they'll have molten lead poured into their eyes  (it's fear mongering towards our most impressionable demographic); if I believed bombing a building would prevent me from going through something like that I honestly can't say whether I wouldn't do it or not (and that sickens me).

"
53,dle6mzv,"Personally, I think we need a bill of rights for kids. The abuse leftist and Muslim parents are allowed to get away with is ridiculous. Child suicide bombers? Transgender five year olds? Disgusting. 

I don't think children should be allowed to participate in any religion. There's no way that could or should be enforced by law though, because that would infringe on some very basic liberties. But that would be the ideal. "
54,fv48aiw,Muslim parents are so loving. If you embarrass us in front of our friends we will murder you. awww.

56,fvq3sku,"Ah yes, the atheist. How about you stick to your beliefs and all the indoctrination and brain-washing that you've experienced and let Muslim women to their's? 

Men and women have different expectations in Islam and there are many restrictions placed on men that are not placed on women. Muslims choose to abide by these rules because of their faith and Muslim children are just as indoctrinated as children of atheists. Or are you not going to tell your children how much ""death, destruction... blah blah blah"" has been caused by religion. Conveniently forgetting that all the top mass-murderers in history were atheists."
57,fol5i2p,"&gt;  your bullshit is crazy-making and you are a bad man and a bad father.

58,fp7180h,"The ideology of Islam, I would say, is more prone to violence than Christianity because Islam has yet to undergo a reformation it badly needs.  That doesn't mean that all Muslim children are taught to murder people though."
59,fph4kj5,"&gt; I'm afraid your calling me and all the other posters on this subreddit ignorant is more childish than anything I said.

I didn't call them all ignorant. Some are actually just peaceful people, but they're far and few. Don't put words in my mouth. Also, it's a perfectly fine statement, and not some silly joke I made.

&gt; You keep putting words in my mouth, saying I said anyone who disagreed with me was deluded and misguided when I never did.

I already clarified this earlier but it's clear that you're not reading anything I write, so here's another attempt: your comment was vague and I was aware others would read it, and thus made a general response to both them and you. If you don't feel it was fair, that's fine, but I just feel that somehow pretending as if I've dodged the point is unfair to me as well.

&gt; I don't believe in personal attacks because you have your fairytale and I have mine (though mine might be based on math and physics).

First of all, I'd just like to say that I am as interested in mathematics and physics as you are, if not more, and the whole argument that those fields somehow provide a clear and well-defined structure to the world while religion does not is just irritating. You can call it a fairytale all you want, it doesn't change the fact that it's just as good of a theory as your so-called ""math and physics"", which you clearly just throw out there to seem superior. Just feeds back into the idea that arguing with children gives you no way to win.

&gt; You say you presented to me what islam actually says, which I don't believe any more than I believe christianity or judaism, so it means nothing.

You don't have to believe in what Islam says. That wasn't my point to begin with. I honestly don’t care.

&gt; I said in islam thought is discouraged. And I stand by that.

You can claim that Muslims discourage thought all you want, although that in itself is quite fallacious, but that's not the topic we're discussing. You cannot simply claim that Islam orders or encourages a and b when it clearly discourages both. I don't understand how that isn't a simple concept to you. Let's try this:

Judge: May the lawyer for this man stand up.

Lawyer: There is no evidence whatsoever that my client has committed this heinous murder. He, in fact, is paralyzed from the neck down and cannot even move a muscle.

Judge: Guilty. Life in prison.

That's how ignorant your argument sounds. It's just a joke.

&gt; I lived it and I saw it and I experienced it as an arab muslim-at-the-time woman. 

I've live nearly my entire life within the Middle East and Arab countries with Muslims and Arabs. It's also clear that I myself fit into both categories. The fact that I have been in the same environment you are claiming discourages thought just emphasizes the gaping holes in your argument. You had a (questionable though acceptable) experience with a small number of Muslims or Arabs and have thus come to a hasty conclusion about Islam as a whole. You've somehow managed to get from a to gamma in one shot. It's almost... impressive.

&gt; Nothing you can say will ever change my truth and my reality. You aren't harming me at.

You can call it opinion or experience, but truth and reality would not be the right words here. Not when you're rejecting the objective truth agreed upon by Muslims and projected and advocated by Islam. Some people on this subreddit raise interesting points worth responding to. This ain't one of them.
And if I'm not harming you, then what explains the negative response to simple advice. I asked you to be analytical when coming across information about Islam or really anything else, and you more-or-less said no, or simply refused simple general advice because it has to do with Islam (I presume that is the reason). It's just a really poor attempt.

&gt; I just think you're wasting your time. Feel free to respond or not. I'm unsure of whether or not to further this conversation.

It's not a waste when people are happy that mosques burn down or that Muslim children are dead. It's not a waste when Muslims are being told to ""go back to their country"" as if they are useless filth. It's not a waste when innocent Arab children and families are massacred without remorse. 

Stop spreading misinformation to the gullible people who may come across your posts or comments. You're just perpetuating this behavior and intolerance of innocent Muslims and Arabs, and it's honestly disgusting and such a shame."
60,ffiykji,"I'm a she, and I was raised by nuns and Jesuit priests in a Catholic children's home, so an outlier. I was forced to study the Bible, was abused if I refused to go to church, and was treated like a child whore when the nuns found out I was being sexually abused. Told me I was tainted in the eyes of God, and that little whore girls like me were responsible for the downfall of mankind. Straight up.

Lovely way to grow up.

Christianity (incl Mormonism, Catholicism etc) is a disgusting religion, so is Judaism and Islam. They all abuse children, it's central to the dogma/indoctrination.

Easier to call it all ""Abrahamism"". They all worship the same Abrahamic god anyway, the same core rules, murder homosexuals, sexually abuse children, subjugate women, kill other races, murder non-believers in God's name.

Same shit, same god, same rules, different flavour.

I am horrified thinking how young Muslim children are being treated around the world... the violent abuse they are suffering and have no escape from because the world is so busy protecting a manmade, absurd, hateful religion than protecting the children being abused by that religion."
61,ecvlcyw,"It's not one or the other.  All pedos deserve, at the very least, life in prison.  No one defends white pedos or rapists except attorneys or other rapists/pedos.  But, when you see a large influx from one community it should be addressed.  Sadly, no people will ever be rid of child abusers.  The British government ""buried"" the pedo rings because the people would revolt if they knew the extent to which their leaders abused and murdered kids.  On the flip side, Paki and muslims don't seem to mind much if non-muslim children are abused by muslims. Sorry, this is a fact.  This is why they prey on white kids, because they aren't muslim.  The religion excuses the actions.  ""b-b-but that's not real islam"". sorry, it clearly is"
62,e46txg1,"That article says

&gt;The church has declined to baptize many Muslims because doing so would put them in danger for leaving their faith either under interpretations of Islamic law or family culture. 

That has nothing to do with age. On my mission we meet an adult man who was Muslim and our mission president has to ok us teaching him to make sure he wouldn't be in danger. I'm pretty sure that if Muslim parents are fine with their child being baptized (and extended family aren't going to murder them), the church will baptize the kid."
63,dn049hp,"Yes, those little Muslim children are responsible for their own murders."
64,dl1nat2,"This is, for me, the toughest part about being a closeted ex-Muslim. I agree with you about not telling my family.

A lot of people think the only reason Muslim parents are so stubborn in not letting their child become an apostate is simply to retain control over them, but it's a lot more complicated than that.

I've thought about the dilemma of a parent who believes in Hell but also loves their child dearly. What would they do if they thought their child was on an irreversible path to apostasy? Would death of the child be the only way to prevent apostasy, and thus eternal damnation? Would such a loving parent commit murder to save their child from the fires of Hell?

The scary thing is, I'm sure there are loving parents that would kill their child to save their soul. I know my mom would never kill me, but she would suffer greatly thinking I would be in Hell forever. 

This is why I despise Islam so much. It causes so much pain, even for Muslims.
"
65,dik3k0l,"&gt;a parent’s failure to recognize and support a child’s gender self-identification is a form of child abuse,

OK.  

Now, let's compare.  

This month, which is actually relatively cool compared to some years, the children of Muslim parents are having a hard time in class, because their parents tell them they can't drink, and must refuse a drink if it is offered.  These kids are awakened at 3:00 AM to eat, then sent back to sleep.  It messes them up for the whole day.

THAT is child abuse.  And when a kid dies because their heart can't take the dehydration, what are we going to do?  Will we do what we do to Christian parents who murder their kids through the denial of proper care?  Will we have the guts to imprison these people for murder, when it happens?  Of course not.

These kids are not Muslim.  Islam is not a race.  You can't be born with it.  They simply have the misfortune of living with Muslim parents, and these kids' religious rights, which are ENTIRELY independent of their parents' rights, are violated on an hourly basis.  And we enable it. 

Shame on all of us.

Oh, and cutting your boy's d--- because YOU want it to look a certain way, that's OK in Ontario, too.  But there couldn't be a clearer case of child abuse."
66,eofwd4b,"I have met both sides, the UK and echo chambers really allow them to come through. 

Muslims are across the board - some are the some best people I have met - I spend every school holiday at my Muslim's aunts house for weeks on end, but then you get the bigots who advocated for sharia law, criminalising LGBT and other backward ideas  which disgust me.

Currently in Birmingham and London, muslim parents are protesting against kids being taught about same sex relationships in state schools. There are many Islamic, both private and state, schools for their children to go to. 

LGBT should be put ahead of religion in all cases as religion can be changed but sexuality cannot be.  

Mosques and Islamic centres allow bigotry and medieval ideologues to fester and grow, there was a recent survey ( 3 years ago) done :

 [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law)   

It shows how Britain is failing to fully integrate immigrants into British values of diversity and acceptance, while the majority is accepting and people who are bigots are excluded and discouraged but it doesn't seem that way from the left to integrate British Muslims."
67,ea1z9tx,"The difference between the US and Europe regarding race isn't that it doesn't happen in one place.  France literally criminalized the burka.  Police shootings are at least nominally illegal in the US.  You're not allowed to have minarets on mosques in Switzerland.  In Denmark, Muslim children are required to be taken from their parents. America had a civil war over the abolition of slavery.  Hitler was German.  American's are at least ashamed of their racism."
68,dx9hu4l,"If Muslim children are allowed to and encouraged to participate in the cultural underpinnings that make Germany a free, open, educated and liberal society then I believe that these new Germans will discard the ways of their parents because frankly, if given the choice, few people would choose Islam over the available alternative. The only way this goes wrong is if the German people allow this new immigrant wave to sequester itself in enclaves and perpetuate the anachronisms that are currently destroying the Middle East. When German government officials are making excuses for migrant criminals the way they did after the Cologne sexual assaults they are definitely getting it wrong."
69,dj3ifq5,"One thing we need to encourage is investing in community centres. As many first or second generation muslim youngers, are kept in by their parents as the uk has a very young binge drinking culture and they come from strict conservative family background.
They get trapped up at home and only have religion to excape into.

I am still best mates with a kid from my primary school who went through exactly this. He started walking about always in white traditional wear and wasn't allowed out late. 
Muslim parents are some of the strictist Ive seen and although many of them know when to let go, many are worried about there kids going down the wrong path. 

 He is now older and so has responsibility for himself, and has come back out of his shell again. 
I went  to outlook with him a year or so back, and He's truely a Lad now.

I can totally see just why young muslims get drawn into the path, just as young white kids get drawn into EDL. If all you see is anger and poverty, as most do in the world, then it starts to draw all of us to certain mindsets.

70,diuk5va,"&gt;“Janice Kroeger, the senior deputy prosecuting attorney, who was supposed to be trying these boys for their crimes, defended the boys and repeatedly attacked Lacy, the victim’s mother. A therapist for the boys was present, as well as a parole officer and a detective. Everything that was said was designed to portray the perpetrators as victims. Throughout the proceedings, they were repeatedly called victims.”

This is the society we live in now. Where rapists are afforded the victim status instead of those they've raped.

&gt;“All three were given probation. They were not found guilty of rape, but of sexually lewd conduct.”

It's okay to rape little white girls so long as you're not of age, a migrant or a muslim. Combine each of these and you become the actual victim in whatever rape case you're involved in.

&gt;Geller said every time the family’s lawyer, Guerry, tried to speak up, he was silenced.

And you better not protest this or else they'll throw the book at you. Browns have a right to rape little white girls you fucking racist bigot.

&gt;The 5-year-old victim, Jayla, was never mentioned by Kroeger or the judge – or by the police.

Because as far as they're concerned these victims don't exist.

And that's really the point of it all. Even Muslim children are rape prone subhumans who will go unpunished by a judicial system that no longer protects its native people but foreign bands of barbarians.

If the law doesn't protect you and is unwilling to punish criminals than it is up to the people to carry out justice."
71,fksf1mt,"I’m not a expert honestly, I grew up with shit load of Christian friends, and i had a very strict Muslim family. I just know islam is a very very young religion and it hasn’t been reformed. 

Whereas Christianity has been reformed. The crazy Christians are always talked shit about by your typical everyday Christian American who goes to church once a week on Sunday or once a year.....even you’ll see people speak against Mormons an against the Jehovah’s. 

But the issue is your everyday Muslim has extremist ideas. And your everyday average Muslim who use to be me couldn’t even speak against the hijab or against stoning, because the way the Quran is structured along with the Hadith. You will be considered a non Muslim if you even try to debate or disagree with the almighty Allah. 

Problem with Islam though is, the way it’s structured is like a extreme dictatorship. It’s very hard to reform the religion. Even peaceful Muslims are definitely peaceful, but ask them if they believe that someone should have their hand chopped off or stealing, they will say if Allah orders it then i can not disagree...

So  you cannot question it, you cannot give your own opinion. In Christianity you can. Idk if it’s because Christianity has a weaker unorganized structure, i think Christianity just focuses on bigger picture....”love thy enemy” “Jesus loves you” etc etc I feel like Christianity was like setup little bit poorly, idk why. Whereas in Islam, you literally have a list of how to use the bathroom, and you could technically be sinning if you do not do it the way Muhammed recommend you to do. So Muslim children are taught that Americans are stupid for using toilet paper. They’re using that against people who are stocking up on toilet paper because of the virus. 

According to Muhammed Allah hates people who yawn, so when you yawn muahmmed recommends people to cover their mouths. Tiny.....little crazy details..........

 If Muslims  says the hijab is extreme and Muslim women can wear whatever they want then you’re kicking yourself out of the religion. I know plenty of Muslims till this day, they love their religion but their religion hates them. And they’re always justifying it. It’s so sad. 


What I said isn’t to talk crap, it’s just how islam is designed. To each their own."
72,fdgv0af,"Well my logic tells me that there have been massive open protests against the islamic regime. Doesnt really compare with the current situation. 

Also noth korea can get huge numbers up on the streets or armies parading. And the people there often know very well theyre being opressed. That doesnt say much. If the state is tolalitarian enough, fear (or social control) is enough the get these numbers up. Its not as unlogical as you make it seem. 

Not that I’m convinced since I’m not directly involved in society there. It’s just odd with the sentiments I see in for example r/Iran, were people who claim to be living there say they dont know anyone that really cares about his death. 

&gt; No, but according to your previous comment, in ""the West"" people will allegedly be denied their right to peacefully assemble when the ""capacity limits"" are reached.

Ye if there are possibly massive safety concerns. Ofcourse. Whats even wrong about that?... Also it would not be enforced, it would probably be managed by the organisation is what I was saying.

edit: 

Here have one of many comments/posts from an iranian:


FOR ANY NEW FOREIGNERS TO THE SUB

From a troubled and frustrated Iranian-American

I would just like to educate those who are not familiar with Iran about the country and situation (particularly Americans but all foreigners in general). 

First some basics:

Iran is not the same as Iraq and frankly they are not more similar to Iraq than they are to say Syria or Azerbaijan. In fact, the most similar country to Iran in terms of culture, language, etc. is probably Afghanistan as we relatively speak nearly the same language (Farsi vs Dari). Just because in the English they are spelled very similarly and they border each other on the map doesn’t mean they are twins. In Persian/Farsi, the main language of Iran, the two are not even the similar in prononciation. 

Iranians are NOT Arabs (except for the 1-2% by the Iraq border. Iranians (for the most part) are considered Persians and celebrate a similar Persian culture (even some of those who are Kurd, Turkmen, Azeri) that comes from the ancient Persian empire, not the Arab one. Our language is not even in the same language family as the Arabs. Persian/Farsi is actually in the Indo-European language family. However, due to the Arab invasions of Persia, much of the language (and some of our culture such as being majority Muslim rather than Zoroastrian) has been Arabified. Other languages have also influenced Farsi but Arabic is the largest proponent of this. However, Iranians can still technically speak Farsi without using any foreign words. For example, we say Merci like the French as thank you (though the pronunciation is different) but you could also say Ce Pas Gozaram or just Ce Pas for short which is the traditional Iranian way to say it. Similarly, Salam is how we say hello (which comes from Arabic) but you could also say Darood which comes from traditional Zoroastrian Farsi. However, very few people use these alternatives and just opt for the foreign influenced status quo.

Iranians are actually historically relatively very socially progressive, and I would go as far to say that Iranians and their culture are historically the most progressive in the Middle East. The last forty years under the extreme Islamist regime don’t define Iranians. Before the regime, of course extremely rare, there were even gay bars in Iran in Tehran, the capital. Dont get me wrong; Iranians are obviously pretty conservative compared to Westerns, but in context, they are a very openminded people. For example, during WWII, Iran accepted over 100,000 Polish refugees (mostly Jews). Many chose to stay after the war, and there are still many cemeteries solely dedicated to them. This is very ironic considering the government’s current attitude towards Jews and Israel. In fact, the Persian empire was the first to ban slavery as King Cyrus the Great of Persia created the first declaration of human rights in 539 BCE known as the Cyrus Cylinder. This established the first freedom of religion in a country which is ironic considering the current theocratic dictatorship. The Persians are also known and praised in the Torah and Old Testament of the Holy Bible for freeing the Jews from captivity after conquering Babylon. Iranians have a very rich history that they are very proud of being one of three oldest still existing cultures/civilizations along with Greece and China.

This is very important: the Iranian people and the Islamic republic (the current government/regime) is very different from the people. Most (self-respecting) Iranians don’t support the regime and nearly all of the Iranian diaspora is against (or neutral at the very least) towards the regime. Iranians have been protesting against the regime for decades, especially with the infamous Green Revolution (which untimely failed. However, the regime is extremely cruel, ruthless, and autocratic. They kill all those who oppose them. There is no freedom of speech; just criticizing the Ayatollah (Supreme Leader) can get you at least 2 years in jail with torturing and you and you’re family could even disappear. Things like alcohol and even fun in general (people at one point couldn’t turn their radios up too loud and they currently can’t dance in public) are forbidden however, people still do it in private, including the regime members themselves who are complete hypocrites and don’t actually follow Islamic Sharia Law. Many claim to hate America but have many family members that live there. It is all fake to keep power. Women and men that are not related or married can’t even hold hands in public without getting stopped and harassed by the religious police. They just want to make everyone miserable so they won’t revolt for political rights because all they want are basic human rights. My mother was stopped at a movie theater by the religious police and put in the back of a van just because a tiny bit of hair was showing from under her legally required head scarf. She was very young and innocent and they threatened her with years of torture in jail. They are nothing less than monsters.

No freedom exists. There is extensive censoring. For example, when you go to watch a movie like Frozen at the movie theater, it ends up only being 30 or 40 minutes long because they cut out everything that even slightly resembles a romantic connection. Even men are supposed to wear “hijab” which in Iran means to cover up. Men are supposed to wear long sleeve shirts and pants at all time like women but they are usually more relaxed with men. They are insane. There isn’t even religious freedom because those who are born to Muslim parents are not allowed to convert to another religion. Also, most minority religions are persecuted indefinitely which explains the mass exodus of Iranian Jews, many of which went to Israel. They have committed thousands of human rights violation according to Amnesty International with no remorse. The government cares nothing about the people. The regime members steal billions if not trillions of dollars from the people and buy their children expensive estates in Europe and even America, while many Iranians starve on the streets and posters advertising kidneys being sold hang in the streets.

Iranians are not uncivilized and primitive. Iranian men don’t beat their wives or whatever some ignorant Americans think. Iranian women before the regime were had near identical rights to men. In urban areas. Iranians are pretty socially progressive, even more so than many Americans. My parents and many Iranians I know in American and Canada are just as progressive as those around them, believe in gay rights, etc. The issues only came with the regime.

Most regime supporters and extremely ignorant and uneducated or they are on the pay roll of the government or they are connected to and benefit from the regime in some way or form. Most people are against the regime but to scared to rebel because according to precedent they will just end up killed unjustly and no change will occur.

73,f46m1b8,"I don't worship any book for starters.  The bible and christianity moved from its bloody origins through the new testament and reformation to what it is today.  You know as well as I that there is no new version of the quran, there was no reformation as was seen with christianity.  The quran has peaceful earlier teachings which are superceded by the later bloody hateful teachings that take precedence.  The hadiths reinforce these.  

Currently today muslim children are taught to hate jews.  They are taught to own women.  They are taught to kill homosexuals, apostates, and infidels (if you aren't muslim, this is you).  They are taught to take slaves, and that the world is divided into 2 parts, the muslim world, and the world at war (if you don't live in a muslim country, you live in the world at war).  And the most chilling part is that this is being taught here in the west at mosques in every single western country."

You are being silly to require a study to show that statistically 

Children of Hindu parents are more like,y to adopt Hindu than alternate religions
Children of Buddhist parents are more likely to adopt Buddhism than alternate religions
Children of Muslim parents are more likely to adopt Islam than alternate religions
Children of Taoist parents are more likely to adopt Taoism than alternate religions
Children of Jewish parents are more likely to adopt Judaism than alternate religions

Is this what you need a study for to understand and accept it.

Really!

Theism is widely disputed as there are so many brands. There is no widespread agreement on what flavour of god is the real one. Shiva, allah, Yahweh, Jesus, Gautama, mahavira etc has so split the god market there is much less agreement and even war fought over the subject as opposed to the very simple and universally accepted advice to kids not to go over cliffs.

You don’t get to group all theists together to make your argument any more than I get to group all warnings to kids about any danger.

3 complex

Yes , teaching about an unseen being that provides everything “all things bright and beautiful” is a complex concept requiring critical thinking to unbundle, but Sunday school crashes on with the indoctrination program anyway. Maybe just colouring in and songs but the subject is not so benign.

Everyone neighboring Bangladesh is against Bengali Sunni illegal immigration. The Bodo Hindus of Bodoland in Assam, the Assamese Hindus of Assam, the Naga animists of Nagaland, the Tripuri Hindus of Tripura, the Jumma Buddhists of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the Rakhine, Daingnet and Mro of Arakan in Myanmar and the Bengali Hindus of West Bengal. The Seven Sister states, Arakan, the Chittagong Hill Tracts and Bengal are sick of them.

Bengali Sunnis refer to Bengali Hindus as malaun (mal'un which means cursed, damned to hell) in normal conversation. Bengali Hindus and other non-Muslim children are abused with this word by Bengali Sunnis starting at school where the Bengali Sunni children learn to hate them from their parents and teachers. 

""Rohingya"" Bengali Sunnis massacred and raped their own Bengali Hindu people. They are the ones who divide by both ethnicity and religion. They hate people who are not of their ethnicity and people who are not of their religion. Bengali Hindus were raped and force to convert to Sunnism in the ""Rohingya"" Bengali Sunni dominated refugee camps.

Bengali Sunnis are the ones committing genocide against indigenous Jumma Buddhists in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

Bangladesh needs to cease trying to export hatred and war against its neighbors. Bengali Sunni Islamists have announced hostile intentions to take over Europe by sending waves of illegal Bengali Sunni migrants. The international community needs to join together and force them to take back every single illegal Bengali Sunni from the EU, from the Northeastern Seven Sisters in India, and from Myanmar.

77,fsy47br,"Turning this into an implied sectarian comparison between Christians and Muslims is very counterproductive. From my experience many Muslim parents are much more open to the marriage of Christians than you think (besides extremist factions like Habashiye). But as a Muslim who doesn’t even practice Islam I have been so deeply segragated against by the parents, families, and friends of almost every single Christian girl I’ve dated. Believe me they’re no better, you just don’t see it (as I’m assuming from your comment you’re Christian, which is fair enough).

Many unfortunately share the sentiment that Shi’ites need to “go back to fishing and cleaning houses”. Much more than I’m comfortable with. And I’ve been directly told that to my face from multiple families that don’t even know each other.

Sectarianism is horribly wrong and the opposition to civil marriage is just as absurd in every single sect, be it for religion or just racism against a group."
78,fomyjkx,"Well your argument is basically 'dont blame the people, it's the countries being controlled by extremists and that's the West's fault'. Which is flat out incorrect, as I demonstrated by saying that even the majority of Muslims living in progressive societies hold the same views. Many of those countries which you claim are controlled by extremists, are actually functioning democracies, so the people vote those regimes in. You're making excuses for Muslims in general, who generally hold homophobic views as demonstrated in polls and stats. In the UK right now, there is a school in Birmingham where Muslim parents are protesting the teaching of pro-LGBT lessons. How is that the West's fault'?"
79,exn7ocw,"You're parents are wrong for telling you that Islam rids you of any feelings of anxiety, depression or misery. There are devote Muslims right now who are suffering to no end. Innocent ""Muslim"" children are born in worn torn country and are forced to live a torturous life and die before their first birthday. Where is Allah then?

Even if Islam was the right religion, it does not rid a person of sorrow and misery. 

I would suggest you seek professional help, even if you have to hide this from your parents. I would also encourage you to weigh out the benefits and drawbacks of doing things that a forbade in Islam (like the tattoos, piercings etc). If your parents are extremists and doing those thing will endanger you, then my advice is that you shouldn't do those things until you're fully financially independent and don't rely on your parents for anything.

I hope things get better for you, but I do think you need to be proactive in seeking professional help in order to do this. If you cannot, then try online counselling or apps that help deal with depression, anxiety etc"
80,egax4he,"Islam's the same; children of Muslim parents are Muslim.

IMO antisemitism and Islamophobia are eerily similar, in that the prejudice they inspire is racial in character, fueled by conspiracy theories about wild orientalist religious practices as well as a belief that the ethnic group shares a belief of superiority that they keep hidden from the majority racial/ethnic group in a given society, and are trying to subordinate the majority to their will. The whole ""Judeobolshevism"" thing from the nazi times - where jews were secretly using communism to destroy the west - is revived in the narrative of secret muslim extremists - where muslims are secretly planning to overthrow every society they find themselves in and create a single world caliphate."

84,dihbxpq,"&gt; We need to ensure that all Muslim children are getting proper educations (in my view we need an complete end to all faith schools, and strict monitoring of home schooling): children should have a basic human right to a free, secular education that allows and encourages critical thinking.

So if he isn't dave then who is he? I think I know, lets see if anyone else can spot who it is.. Seems i may have read it wrong.
Here's the evidence below.

*M16Observer 5 points 2 years ago*

*Government figures show a lot of second generation Muslim children are becoming more secular. They no longer accept being indoctrinated in the Mosque. More commonly those that do attend Mosque state their reason is an unwillingness to cause conflict within the family rather than a belief in God. They have experienced Western life and prefer to watch Doctor Who and take part in sport and computer games than follow a strict Islamic culture.*

*The thing is that making people believers in God is not so easy and moulding a Muslim into a extreme Islamic militant is even harder. You need to find the right sort of disaffected young person, feed them the narrative, get them steamed up and then convince them to take up arms. Its a lot of effort.*

*On the other hand British culture is here already and young Muslims are part of it, it literally takes zero effort. We are all curious by nature and young Muslims are no different. Young people want to try new things whether that is drugs, sex or rock n roll. All things you would think Islamic culture disapproves of. But young Muslims are trying it all. Humans like entertainment and aspire to the things we see on TV, the flat screen TV the foreign holidays the expensive clothes and cars. The big houses etc etc you get the idea anyway. These things are incredibly alluring. Our soft cultural is way stronger than Islams cultural power which is just fucking boring. What do you think a second generation Muslim child wants to do? Read the Quran and go to the Mosque or play Xbox and watch Doctor Who? Just the telly we put out probably converts WAY more Muslims into secular thinking than the most radical Islamist could ever hope to convert themselves.*

*British Muslims are becoming more secular day by day. Get used to it Elton.*

However we do know who MoDawaComunityLeader was, right?  ;)

89,fw9b3wa,"Don't look at Islam as a personal thing. You would think that religion is supposed to be a personal matter. Unfortunately Islam is not just about spirituality of ones self, it intends to regulate the world in every single aspect, you would not even believe how much it tries to do so and to embed its moral standards into its followers.

Muslim children are raised to believe that they are better than everyone else, that they are on the true path and that if you would refrain from that path you would suffer dire consequences in the afterlife.

Islam orders its followers to show kindness to the non believers but you should HATE them in the depths of your heart. I was taught this in my Islamic school in Doha Qatar where I grew up. Its a country filled with expats of all backgrounds (Me amongst them) .
They taught me to hate the Kuffar in my heart but only show kindness on the outside. I was taught that at a very very young age, roughly around 3rd to 6th grade. Even one of my classmates asked the teacher multiple times why, knowing that its wrong. But who dares question the teachings of our God and prophet."
90,fhkd9dv,"&gt;This was not caused by your actions alone. You should have had professional support. It isn't your fault if your country cannot give you proper health care. You should have been supported by your family and all the people around you, whoever they were.

I know and I hope I did. Unfortunately that's just how it is for most people around the world, who's voices we don't hear.

&gt;Even your friend is responsible on her own part for letting you depend on her too much. It wasn't your job to decide or know how much she can take. It's hers if she is an adult and somewhat her family's, depending on how young she is. But it definitely isn't something you were supposed to know. Unless of course you intented to harm her — I expect you didn't — which would change the picture, but would still not remove her responsibility of her own self, nor your need for help from the other people around you.

Not her fault, she tried to help me. We both loved each other and intended to marry after university. She is a very kind and extroverted person who loves to help other people, and that's how we got in touch. Her parents are rich but workaholics who always neglected her. I'm a manipulator. All the bad things people did to me, I did to the ones who treated me nicely. Didn't do it purposefully. She knew about my mental illness and other problems and I kept telling her I'll change and stop hurting her but I never could. Mental problems are not excuse enough to cause harm to others but that's unfortunately what happens. Damaged people cause damage to others. 

I hate to admit this, but I derive pleasure from causing people misery. How do I live with this fact about myself.

&gt;How a child is treated by his or her parents is cruicial. If the child does not become attached on a healthy way to the mother beginning from infancy and/or that attachment doesn't continue it can cause serious problems to the individual in the future.
&gt;That is all naturally the parents' job. If there is an issue from the baby's side I can only imagine it must be neurological, in which case it cannot be on any way the baby's fault. It would then be the parents' job, with guidance from specialists, to give the child all the possible support and help he/she needs.

I know. We can talk about these things all day long, but that doesn't change the fact that these things happen. Muslim parents are well known for mistreating their children. Islam was supposed to change people, bring the solution to their problems. What happened? Quran says the test of mankind is fair for all. Is it though? Where's the mercy that the miserable and oppressed were promised? These are some of the reasons why young people feel alienated and end up abandoning faith."
91,fk84kjk,"Erm I respect Trans rights, they suffer a lot, but a lot of the non-binary stuff can get cringe and I think a lot of people might be over emphasising their mild dysphoria to be part of the movement. I don’t feel traditionally male and I have been bullied and called gay for not liking traditionally masculine things. I wouldn’t try to co-opt any kind of movement for that though.

Multiculturalism is again dependent on the culture, if the culture is fine to adopt western enlightenment values as well as exhibiting their culture then I think that enriches us. But certain cultures just seem to want to reap the benefits of a western society while fighting against its values. Like how in my country muslim parents are protesting a program to teach kids about lgbt history in schools, which is pretty fucking ironic considering how much leftists will protect Muslims here.

I also hate a lot of leftists, but it’s mostly tankies and sjw-style lib left (who are actually auth)."
92,fee84ku,"Are you new here?

&gt;Love urself 1st! What does this even mean? People don't get married because they are unable to spend time alone with themselves. It's very generic and unhelpful

Imagine being married to someone who hates themselves, and then spending the rest of your life trying to make that person happy and love themselves. It is not the responsibility of your spouse to make you happy. Yet so many people on this subreddit are severely depressed and hate themselves, and feel like finding a wife/husband will cure that. I've spent far too long in my life trying to make myself a better person/make myself happy, understand my ways to end up married to a guy who hates himself and will be needy in wanting attention for the rest of our lives. Fine for a child, not fine for a grown man.

&gt;Get therapy! Like not every small sadness requires deep mental healing. And it's expensive.

The reason therapy is highly recommended here is because so many people need it. Muslim parents are not exactly the best parents around, for the most part. They shelter their kids, most of them don't even have a healthy relationship as husband/wife, and the kids believe that to be the norm. How many people in this subreddit have never seen their parents hug/kiss? A huge majority - that's NOT normal behaviour among parents. There are so, so, many things wrong with our upbringing and most people have become aware of it, which is why therapy is recommended.

Go through our subreddit:

* you have 20 year old women talking about their ticking biological clock and how they're losing their youth and need to get married ASAP 
* 35 year old men after 18 year olds
* men with severe porn addictions who can't get up unless there's some porn star in his mind
* women who don't allow their husbands to see them naked
* Women taking years to consummate the marriage, and men thinking this is normal behaviour 
* Women who are afraid of losing their virginity, even though it's halal, to remain pure
* Men who are so bored in their marriage and have started seeking out haram ways to be satisfied (not just sexually, but emotionally)
* You have men AND women with insane, ridiculous dealbreakers
* Women who think they're entitled to a 50K mahram
* Men who think they're entitled for sex at any point in the day

I can go on and on, but the reality is there are so many people who need therapy. It wouldn't be recommended if it wasn't lol. 

&gt;Take a break! I do agree with this to some extent because the search process can wear you down, but the break should not mean you have given up. Only so long as to collect yourself and get that motivation back up.

This is literally what everyone means when they say take a break. You only have the 18 year olds who are like wah wah wah I've given up because they're simply immature lmao."
93,f3b21xl,"It's not. 

You'll find deep seated hate and bigotry in every country. When Hollande forced gay marriage on France there were riots. In the UK muslim parents are vehemently opposing teaching LGBT in schools.

Attitudes to LGBT in Poland are changing for the better. It's a gradual process, and right now according to oko.press (a definitely left wing portal) for the first time there's a 50% support for civil unions for **everyone**. In the 90's that number was in the low 10's. 

Do you ""enlightened westerners"" really think you have the right to judge a whole country based on what one party does,**a party that has support of around 6 million people out of 38? Well if so fuck you, you cunts** Spain commited genocides over centuries (especially in the Canary Islands), Belgium still venerates Leopold ""Butcher of Congo"" the Second, UK chemically castrated gay people half a century ago, when Hollande forced gay marriage there were riots, and I don't think I have to even say anything about Germany and it's unobstructed neo-nazi marches in 2019.

And to Poles groveling that they're ""sorry for their country"". Grow a set of balls, if you didn't vote for PiS you have nothing to be ashamed of."
94,exbbdrj,"&gt; Why isn’t skepticism warranted? It’s not vile to suggest that, until further details emerge and the situation is further clarified, he may have been in a fight that was non-political in nature which is what the majority of thoughts expressed here are.

[Here's an upstanding member of baduk being *highly sceptical* about trans people by claiming ""Even in the unlikely event that they do get sent to prison they can choose to be sent to a women's prison where they are free to rape and abuse as many women as they want, thanks a lot progressives!""](https://www.reddit.com/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/cfp1ch/transgender_woman_lashed_out_after_police_didnt/eubu3jk/) The [+16] points next to the post are sceptic points, you see. It shows people being sceptical.

And when a police officer gets accused of doing Nazi salutes and says the parents of transgender children should be shot? [baduk knows what the real problem here is, and it's those pesky trans people ""forcing our police to be ideologically pure""!](https://www.reddit.com/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/ckbzl3/police_officer_accused_of_nazi_salute_and/evo9xz1/) [+9]

Oh, and don't worry if you want conspiracy theories about ""which group is see not supersede all others here"", [I've got just the guy for you!](https://www.reddit.com/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/aldseg/trans_guidance_for_scottish_schools_breaches_11/efdh7r0/) I mean ... the subtly you were going for was just *slightly* undercut by the people immediately going ""[Yes once again it's the mentally ill men""](https://www.reddit.com/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/aldseg/trans_guidance_for_scottish_schools_breaches_11/efdihfs/) who [""completely disregard that it's actually just a potential fetish (check out how many of them get boners just by wearing female clothing""](https://www.reddit.com/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/aldseg/trans_guidance_for_scottish_schools_breaches_11/efdmfam/). I mean, you were going for the subtle transphobia and then whoopsie, but oh well, UPVOTES FOR ALL!

But enough about trans people, that's just LeGiTiMaTe CoNcErNs. I *could* go through the Muslims ... but holy shit I don't think the character limit of the post will handle it. Let's instead talk about the champion of anti-Muslim sentiment ... yes, you're not a hate sub, you just want to #FREETOMMY!

Violence is of course, utterly wrong in the view of baduk. But when it's Tommy punching someone in the face? [A WELL DESERVED RIPOSTE, MY OLD MAN.] [+22] (https://www.reddit.com/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/bxt53z/tommy_robinson_punches_england_fan_in_sickening/eq9g5wg/) Turns up in the middle of the night to harass journalists and dox them on livestream?

And the most particularly fun part is when the hate posts for these different groups slam into each other in a horrific mess, like in stories about Muslims and LGBT people. [Muslim parents are mad about kids being taught that homosexuality is ok?](https://www.reddit.com/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/bcsyka/muslim_parents_outrage_as_fouryearold_school/) But we hate both those things, what are we going to do? [Highly upvote posts complaining that there must be a middle ground between throwing gays off buildings and showing kids a gay relationship, of course!](https://www.reddit.com/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/bcsyka/muslim_parents_outrage_as_fouryearold_school/ektjed8/) [+41] Wait, too subtle? Ah feck it, [let's just make it obvious for the homophobes](https://www.reddit.com/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/bcsyka/muslim_parents_outrage_as_fouryearold_school/ekts1q6/). [+8]

But anyway, have fun while I see myself out. I'll just step out over that swastika mat by the door that you jokingly said you have, while also having [posted threads on here complaining about people posting historical videos of people punching Nazis](https://www.reddit.com/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/7neo2m/out_of_the_blue_on_new_years_day_without_any/) and [mocking people who are ""salty"" for it being removed](https://www.reddit.com/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/7neo2m/out_of_the_blue_on_new_years_day_without_any/ds1acww/) and [complaining about how everyone's called Nazis just for ""dIsAgReEiNg WiTh ThE pRoGrEsSiVe LiNe""!](https://www.reddit.com/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/7neo2m/out_of_the_blue_on_new_years_day_without_any/ds1dszp/)

Enjoy downvoting me, baduk! Actually lets make this fun if some of you see this post ... every time you downvote this post, I'll donate a pound to [Mermaids](https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/). No joke, it's Sunday and I'm chilling out so lets do that. :-D Remember to downvote to show your support for trans children, guys!"
95,exeiwo4,"&gt;Yes, it's fundamentalist religious parents. Which a lot of Muslims are.

Yet a lot of them don't really understand Islam. Humans do a lot behind veils of religion, nationalism, society, peer etc. You are blaming acts of individuals or a certain group and implying that Muslim parents are such. My whole point was to not generalize the issues you might have faced with rest of the parents.

&gt;For some people, Islam and religion gives them meaning in life. For some, it makes them braver, stronger. For some, it turns them into monsters who would disown their child for being gay.

So basically they are human. People take things and enact it in their own understanding whether it is genuine or twisted but they act as humans.

Same can be said of nationalism, communism and other modern - isms.

It's just human nature and tendency.

&gt;Also, according to Islam, marriage fulfills half of your deen.

That is a general statement applicable to those who are capable of marriage. A person without desire is not capable of marriage. 

&gt;And there are gay Muslims (and gay Christians, but we're on an Islamic subreddit, so I'm talking about Muslims) who have internalised homophobia. I don't know if you know what that means, so I'll explain it. It's when homophobia is so ingrained in someone that they learn to hate themselves. And these guys, they love Islam, so they'll try their hardest to ""be straight"", even though it's impossible. They'll get married, and yes, it's because of the Islamic community. The push to get married, forceful parents.

Again the issue is making it an identity. I don't know what you are thinking but everything you say is coming out from making it an identity.

Now if you think of it as desire, and the community starts treating it as desire then we don't face such challenges. Having homosexual desires should not define a person. But once you make it an identity it starts to define the person. That if he is homosexual then he is to be bad, or have good fashion sense or whatever. 

&gt;You're talking about how Muslims should be, but that's not how a lot are. A lot, at least in the older generation, can be extremely homophobic. It ruins lives.

Ok. You need to understand that your parents lived in a different generation with very different cultural norms. The changes have happened very rapidly and globalization has accelerated the change even more. For them it is not that easy to change with time and accommodate accordingly. These things happen. You have this issue. People from other cultures have other issues with their parents. Have you seen the older generation of groups of white people? Their issue is racism, white supremacy etc.

Because they grew up in a certain culture and their friends (who are of similar age) have similar culture, it is very hard for them to change.

So if i dont blame all whites for racism or such why do you want to blame all Muslims  for certain issues you (maybe) have faced?"
96,evinz0j,"So, I don't want to seem like i'm attacking you and i thank you for answering my question. But i feel like you are a bit misinformed about what most muslim women experience. These are my responses to your points:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Outward display of Islam such as beard and clothing that conforms to the sunnah. The weird looks, prejudices that come with it.

Having a beard is not unique to muslim men and actually is in style these days? I don't think hijab will ever be in style. Please don't be a guy who compares beards to hijab lol 

&gt;How does one interact with the opposite gender both Muslim and non muslim. The rules are not clear for most and this leads to a lot of awkwardness.

Muslim women struggle with this too. I literally said i have no muslim guy friends and there's a reason for that. I just have always felt too awkward about it since i went to islamic school and it was against the rules to talk to my male classmates. 

&gt;Anxiety about finding a spouse who will be at the same level of religiosity as he is. The problem is exacerbated for men since they are supposed to be the shepherds (Kullukum Ra'in ...)

Again, muslim women struggle with this too. Why wouldn't we want to marry someone who is similar to us in terms of religion? My only response to your shepherd comment is pls no. 

&gt;Worries about missing out on ""fun"" while all the other guys are just taking it easy. Ties in with the previous point too since what if my future wife is ""taking it easy"" right now?

Considering how many muslim parents are more strict on their daughters than sons, we are most likely missing out on more fun lol. Also i  have no idea what you mean by ""taking it easy""? Do you mean sleeping around? Because if your plan is to marry a conservative religious muslim girl then i can assure you she is not ""taking it easy"". Otherwise you just have a pretty low view of most muslim women. 

&gt;Not able to fit in due to Islamic rules. Hard to find friends with similar values.

I'm sure muslim women struggle with this too. But if you live near a masjid, you can find other muslim friends. Unfortunately for women the masjid is not always a welcoming place.

&gt;Finding a place for namaz at school or work. And wudhu!

Umm do women not pray now lol. Wudu is probably worse for us cause we wear more clothes than men and have to take off our hijab and everything its a whole process.

&gt;Temptation caused by nudity everywhere around us. It seems like men struggle more than women in this regard.

I'm confused by this. Temptation to do what? But to answer your point, its not like there aren't hot shirtless men walking around in the summer. Do you think women don't have sexual desires? I'm just all around confused by this point lol

&gt;Plain old prejudice due to a large number of islam haters out there in positions of power.

yeah my girls Ilhan and Rashida have been getting a LOT of that hate so how is it something only muslim men experience? Plus hijabis stand out as muslims more than men with just beards

&gt;Confusion about religion due to all the sects and in-fighting.

Again, how does this not apply to muslim women?"
97,erkb7x2,"i live in australia and i can assure you all strict muslim parents are basically the same no matter where you live 

the advice on here is always harder to practice than preach. 

while my parents are not as extreme i do feel like i have missed out on so much. 

i have really noticed common patterns i see with not just my parents, but my friends parents and cousins parents and everyone else between. 

i hate the drama and i tend to just be submissive and be that robot. i too am in university trying to finish my degree, trying to get a job and have that money to fall back on, trying to find a way to leave home. i just want to do it a smart way, like through a job opportunity that just so happens to be in another state haha. that way i can somewhat keep a relationship with my parents because again fortunately my parents are not as extreme so ive put up with lost opportunities my whole life. 

&amp;#x200B;

this is why i felt like i had to comment. i feel like i understand that sadness and feeling of not ever being in control. but this isnt about me. this is about you. 

&amp;#x200B;

they want you to have a job not only is that a step forward in the right direction of your own independence but having a job many help with depression, or it can just help take your mind off of your life even if its for a few hours a day. 

two interviews! now thats a good start. im sure there are even more interviews on their way and youll do much better. 

&amp;#x200B;

my advice is to stay calm, causing a scene is only going to make it worse because your stuck in a corner FOR NOW. your living under their roof and therefore they have the control. 

let them sit their and verbally abuse you all they want what difference is it gonna make at this point. they have nothing left to say that they havnt already said. they have already made you loose respect for them so whats the point in trying to talk to a brick wall.  dont give them anything to bitch about because one day you will get up and leave when your ready no warning to them.  

&amp;#x200B;

as for physically controlling you like not allowing you to leave the house to go out and such theres not much i can advise on because these situations are difficult and my only experience is with my own parents.  for me i just gave up trying to go out and have a social life. again ive missed out on so much and its sad but i know that when im out ill make up for all of it.  i had to sacrifice opportunities in order to keep my parents quiet.  its not actually helpful advice but its worked as best as i could have hoped. 

&amp;#x200B;

better days are coming i swear but you need stay strong for your daughter and like you said they love your daughter and therefore she will at least be safe under their care while you can focus on work and studies to provide a better future for both yourself and your daughter. 

&amp;#x200B;

and i know you can start to get lonely when your daughter goes to sleep but i guess thats why we both are on reddit. your not alone.

98,eqnaag7,For sure. Her Muslim parents are horrible for shunning her white catholic fiancé. I hate when people can’t get past their old world ways.
99,eknuiqd,"It's great to see you being your own person, but please be a pragmatist until you're a self-sufficient adult.  I used to browse subreddits for ex Christians and many of them jumped the gun on either coming out to their parents or privately violating religious behaviour codes and it ended up backfiring on many of them.  Are you going to be a dependent for much longer?  Are you confident there are no members of your community who may rat you out?

I hate to sound pushy, but browsing this subreddit has shown that Muslim parents are gold medalists when it comes to being controlling  psychos, and it would be heartbreaking for someone who is close to being free doing something injudicious and permanently ruining their life."
100,ekpibca,"Hi, I can see that you are from r/Islam which is okay. I don't hate Muslims, and I have many Muslim friends (maybe 80% of my friends are Muslims). 

Here is the rundown. I'm sure you are a man so you don't quite understand women are not given a choice in what we can wear. Even on the post on your subreddit about me, many people were angry with what I was wearing.  Complete strangers wanted to dictate my clothing choices. Muslim parents are the same way. I have to wear hijab, a long shirt/dress, full sleeves, and pants that go all the way down to my ankles. Nothing can be see through or thin. Layers are the best. However, since I don't beleive in the religion (which is perfectly okay because even Allah said ""your religion is your religion, my religion is my religion"". Allah said that people beleive in different things and we shouldn't hate on them for it. Correct? So since I am an athiest, why should I continue to wear what Islam allows me to wear and why can't I wear what I want to wear. You see, it is very hot where I live and I suffered from a couple heat strokes in the past and many hijabi Muslimas have had heat related strokes too. It's pretty common. I shouldnt endanger my health for something I don't beleive it. I wore the skirt because it was hot and I thought it was super cute and I wanted to wear it. Therefore, I changed my clothings. But there is nothing wrong the the one of the left. It just wasn't what I wanted to wear and thats okay because people should wear whatever the hell the want to just like how Muslim men can wear whatever the hell they want to wear."
101,eiy5job,"Should we expel all homophobes from the country then? There’s practical considerations to make here. You also can’t call yourself a liberal but insist everyone have the same beliefs as you. I despise homophobia but the most practical solution isn’t authoritarian.  

If you make it so that bigotry in muslim communities (and others) cannot have an effect on things like schools, laws etc, then you minimise it’s effects. Then, it will decline over time as muslim children are taught in pro-LGBT schools and exposed to inclusive ideas. All the while hate speech laws are enforced to protect the LGBT community from homophobia, transphobic etc. There you go, everyone benefits from the pros of multiculturalism whilst minimising the cons, and no one gets hurt, kept in prisons at the border or whatever.

102,egt0jgm,"Im a muslim , i didnt hav a strict muslim upbringing .my dad isnt really a muslim, i dont even remember the last time he prayed ,but my mom is a practicing muslim but she isnt strict either ( i do realize and have seen  there are really strict parents that even do things that contradict the teachings of islam such as teaching to hate kuffars and beat their children really bad  ,but its obvious that they do it more to boost how religious their family to their community than to worship allah) , so i was never forced to pray even though its said muslim children are to be forced to pray at around the age of 7 , so i didnt consider myself a muslim and didnt even know how to read the quran till maybe i was 13 -14 ish ( im 18 now).  I started to learn to read the quran around that age during ramadan Just so i can undersrand what islam is and to decide if it was for me or not . And after a few months later i decided that i am a muslim n slowly began to adopt to praying the 5 prayers n the other practices to be followed .tbh ,i feel happier than i ever was back when i was agnostic . I thought of atheism but that never did make sense to me
And me trying to find out islam didnt come out of nowhere , i was inspired by my muslim friends who were pious and were happy in their lives 
Im not done learning about islam , there is more but i hav learned well enough that im very sure that islam is the one religion that is true.
If you feel that islam isnt for you and that you dont think its right . I disagree with you but ,i respect your opinion. We hav our whole lives to learn what is around us and i think we still havent  seen all life has more to offer
Sorry for the long  paragraphs 😅but most importantly  i hope you to be happy again and find purpose in life and live it to the fullest
I wish inshallah i can meet with you in the future and we can hav a chat. Take care

103,ehcvn61,"I feel like parents use these horror stories of evil children locking away old age pensioners in a home as a way to emotionally blackmail us into living with them forever.

Most our parents are in their 40s - 60s. That's still very very very young. They are very capable of caring for themselves. When they get to be old and need care to be looked after there are many many alternatives to living with them. It's not either live with them or shun and abandon them, there are other options. With my own parents I want them to get a smaller accomodation near one of us siblings then use retirement funds plus the funds from downsizing to pay for a professional carer. For myself personally, insha'Allah when I get old I plan to get an apartment in an old peoples community with my other old friends then we put our money together to pay for a nurse or carer.  It'll be like that show, golden girls. 

I will say I think we over estimate this whole look after parents thing. We have this culture that makes us feel like parents need looking after constantly. Our whole relationship with our parents revolves around what we can do for them and how we can make their life better and in that sense the parent child roles are reversed. Us Muslim children are parentified and burdened with the responsibility of looking after our parents from a very young age when it's supposed to be the opposite. And if we ever want to make our own decisions, choose our own life or live independently we are told to be abandoning or neglecting our parents, as if one is talking about a mother leaving her infant child but we are the mother and our parents are the child. 


I agree leaving one's parents is never about ""fuck off"". That's exaclty my point that at times it's justified. Just like our parents had their reasons for leaving behind their own parents in a different continent there may be reasons why we may need to move on and no longer live with our own parents...usually only moving across town, not as far as another continent. Western people don't hate their parents, some of them do but most have amazing loving relationships whilst at the same time not living with them. I would posit that many Western people actually have more loving relationships with their own parents than we do with ours because their relationships are based on unconditional love and acceptance not conditional love and burdens and obligations. 

Sorry for the essay 🤪🤪🤪"
104,ehz6ob1,"Did you know that the currently untenable violence and hostility surrounding Israel and Palestine (the Middle East crisis you could call it) is actually less than a century old? Or that, before Theodore Herzel and the forming of the Jewish state,  Muslims and Jews lived door by door in cities like Jerusalem, sat together in cafes and buses, purchased goods and services from one another, all without nearly any of the hatred and bloodshed we see there so consistently today...? I know that you don’t know these things because your opinions are those of a mean-spirited and poorly educated 8 year old.
Hatred between Muslims and Jews is Not an age-old, forgone conclusion-It’s a direct result of Israel’s colonialist policies in the Middle East over much of the last century.
I am supportive of the Jewish state, the Jewish people, and Israel’s right to exist. I do Not support Israel’s colonial practices or their use of a fucking concentration camp on the impoverished people of Gaza.
The vast majority of Muslim children are not raised to hate Jewish people, but they are taught to be careful and avoid ignorant little cunts like you."

106,e90rk3o,"Alright , I’m a doctor. I made good money . But at times I hate my job. I see my friends getting married and having kids and having a lot of free time . I don’t . I won’t until the next 3 years. 

If you do what makes you happy , you are way way ahead of many people who aren’t happy with their jobs. Plus it’s mostly desi\arab communities that emphasize so much on men making big bucks before marrying. I’ve seen how supportive non Muslim parents are of their kids having someone that makes them just happy. Literally heard my boss say she is happy that her daughters bf makes her very happy and that’s all she wants from him . 

This objectifying of men and women into source of money and source of intimacy is what turns away a lot of Muslims in the west away from Islam and culture, it’s true. It’s also why Muslims date around and are forced to marry someone who their parents think is good for them. It just doesn’t make anyone happy. 

If you want OP,  branch out, find someone who makes you happy regardless of religion. "
107,eapih4j,"&gt; I actually was surprised about it being Germany... knowing that they, as a nation, actually felt remorse and attempted to educate their kids so that it wouldn’t happen again.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously no one can feel it as the victims feel it. But the story of Germany post-Holocaust did not make me sad for humanity. Until this.

But the children are educated about it.  
And as far as I am aware **it** has not happened again.

There are always going to be people who hate us.  
I live next to Dortmund, aka the Neo Nazi capital of western Germany. Yet I have never encountered a Neo Nazi or was threatened by one.  
Are they there? Sure. But apart from their marches every year not a whole lot happens.

&gt; Also, Muslim immigrants are not exactly running the mainstream narratives. Some are absolutely anti-Semitic but it’s less likely that they’re the teachers and principals not assisting the bullied children, those making the decisions not to educate about the Holocaust properly in the curriculum or write, film, air Holocaust stories or Jewish stories.

Almost every class visits a concentration camp.  
That is pretty much as far as you can go.

And the Muslim children are the problem. They brought the Jew-insult back into school. I always and exclusively encountered this insult from Muslim (children).  
I went to a Gymnasium, which is the highest form of High school in Germany that upon graduation gives you the right to study at a university.  
Because of this not many Muslim children (aka Turks) went to this school. They were perhaps around 20 of over 600 children.  
So you wouldn't expect this kind of behaviour from them. After all they were the educated Muslims.

But when it was about Jews/Israel/Shoah they reacted exactly the same like their less educated friends.  
After some very heated one-sided arguments during Politics and History class I was ganged up on during break. It was made very clear to me that my kind of behaviour (being a Jew, not being against Israel, being a moral reminder of the Shoah) was not acceptable. And if that didn't change something else had to.  
So my parents were a bit... upset after I told my big sister and she our parents.  

To quote my raging father: The principal, my classroom teacher and the liaison teacher all agreed that what happened in class was bad (idk the argument that if Hitler had finished his job there would be peace in the world was pretty deep and the Arabic chants were pretty rhythmic, sure it wasn't during music class, but that's just being a prick about it) and that the incident during break was unacceptable and unfortunate.  
But there wasn't a whole lot they could do.  
After all this was a model school. We were all a big happy family.  
So I pretty much opted out (aka was absent) for politics, history whenever the topic swayed to us.

And you want to know what's funny? This was a good experience. If I had gone to a lower school it would've been worse. Far worse.  
And no it hasn't gotten better."

&gt;“God will never put together a man and woman who are not for each other, that is why you must pray first.”

He regreted ever making mankind according to the bible.  Genesis 6:6  But more to the point, according to the NT, you're not suppose to be married.  In 1 Cor 7, it specifically states that you're to remain single.  The only exception is that if you're so damn horny that you HAVE to have sex, then go get married.   Because it's better to be married having sex than outside of marriage.  

IOW:  Christianity thinks spouses our nothing more than masturbation aids.  A Fleshlight or dildo.  

&gt; “there is no mention of divorce in the Bible. No matter what is happening, pray and pray to God to help you.”

The OT says a man can divorce his wife.  More to the point, Jesus says that a man can divorce his wife for ""sexual immorality"" (whatever that means) in Matthew 19."

The Bodo Hindus of Bodoland in Assam, the Assamese Hindus of Assam, the Naga animists of Nagaland, the Tripuri Hindus of Tripura, the Jumma Buddhists of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the Rakhine, Daingnet and Mro of Arakan in Myanmar and the Bengali Hindus of West Bengal. The Seven Sister states, Arakan, the Chittagong Hill Tracts and Bengal are sick of them.

WTF you going about? Do you know how underdeveloped those regions of India are! Bangladesh is more developed than Indian states in the East and surrounding Bangladesh.


Indian Hindus, especially those of hardline political parties like BJP and especially Shiv Sena don't like Muslims in their nation. That's why they try to use the excuse of ""illegal Bengali"" to try and persecute those Indian Muslims.

&gt; Bengali Sunnis refer to Bengali Hindus as malaun (mal'un which means cursed, damned to hell) in normal conversation.

I am from Bangladesh and it is absolutely bullshit. 

&gt;  Bengali Hindus and other non-Muslim children are abused with this word by Bengali Sunnis starting at school where the Bengali Sunni children learn to hate them from their parents and teachers.

Oh boy, you really are pushing your false narrative. For those who don't know much about Bangladesh, we have holidays for religious events for other major religions in the country (Hindu, Budho, and Christians) and the parliament has specific seats for religious minorities and Hindus have a lot of them for themselves.

&gt; Bengali Sunnis are the ones committing genocide against indigenous Jumma Buddhists in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

Kind of stupid since we had them actually give up arms and negotiate a peace treaty, integrating them into local population and protection against them. 

**Here's a very important part that you are ignoring. The former main opposition party (we don't have election now) which was dominated by Islamists had formed alliance with Budhos and Christians. While the current ruling one (which kicked out democracy) is dominated by pro-Indians and Hindus**."
112,dmsnm9n,"Which is what makes it particularly bewildering that this girl would falsely accuse random strangers for hate crime against Muslims when her own Muslim parents are vindictive, hateful bigots against random strangers that she's dating.

So it won't work and who will check them? Not enough fully qualified gyno's so lE unqualified teacher, hell no. Also do you think non Muslim parents are going to say sure have a gander at my daughter, nope they will say she is not at risk so you then just focus on Muslim kids. This will alienate the very community and kids you looking to protect. Also UKIP hate muslims so yes, any idea that UKIP comes up with will be seen for what it is targeting the Muslim community under the guise of helping them. Please think before you go round accusing people of being pro FGM, its vile and will only be stopped by education in the community and not doing mandatory inspections that will trauma not just kids cut but the rest of them as well."
116,di83yjs,Many people who seem to think Muslim children are brainwashed get most of their views from Anti-Islamic viewpoints. That creates people to hate on Islam without clearly understanding Islam with an open and educated mindset.

The other talked about why Muslim children are terrible cause they “pray to the wrong god”. These were/are both teachers in Bradenton... yes I’ve reported them. No nothing was done that I know of"
120,fun3gbb,"I'm not sure why you claim my suggestion of the right tool for the job is specious. I have heard plenty of atheist scientists describe science as the best tool we have for studying, as you say, the physical and natural world. I absolutely agree with that.

Where I disagree is when they then use that to basically dismiss questions about whether the natural world is all there is, on the basis that their method for studying that world cannot look beyond it.

You use the classic Dawkins accusation of faith ""evading"" calls for evidence, but again, Dawkins dismisses evidence out of hand because it is not scientifica evidence - we are back to verificationism again, whether you like it or not. 

I don't know what Terry Eagleton's overall view of theology is, because he is himself an atheist, but clearly one who does not feel that lazy dismissals further any argument. Perhaps you should read the whole of his review, because again, he addresses this:

""There are always topics on which otherwise scrupulous minds will cave in with scarcely a struggle to the grossest prejudice. For a lot of academic psychologists, it is Jacques Lacan; for Oxbridge philosophers it is Heidegger; for former citizens of the Soviet bloc it is the writings of Marx; for militant rationalists it is religion.

What, one wonders, are Dawkins’s views on the epistemological differences between Aquinas and Duns Scotus? Has he read Eriugena on subjectivity, Rahner on grace or Moltmann on hope? Has he even heard of them? Or does he imagine like a bumptious young barrister that you can defeat the opposition while being complacently ignorant of its toughest case? Dawkins, it appears, has sometimes been told by theologians that he sets up straw men only to bowl them over, a charge he rebuts in this book; but if The God Delusion is anything to go by, they are absolutely right.""

And also:

""A molehill of instances out of a mountain of them will have to suffice. Dawkins considers that all faith is blind faith, and that Christian and Muslim children are brought up to believe unquestioningly. Not even the dim-witted clerics who knocked me about at grammar school thought that. For mainstream Christianity, reason, argument and honest doubt have always played an integral role in belief. (Where, given that he invites us at one point to question everything, is Dawkins’s own critique of science, objectivity, liberalism, atheism and the like?) Reason, to be sure, doesn’t go all the way down for believers, but it doesn’t for most sensitive, civilised non-religious types either. Even Richard Dawkins lives more by faith than by reason. We hold many beliefs that have no unimpeachably rational justification, but are nonetheless reasonable to entertain. Only positivists think that ‘rational’ means ‘scientific’.""

Dawkins likes to portray faith as the result of the indoctrination of children, conveniently ignoring enormous numbers of people who come to belief as adults, often by following logical though processes. C.S Lewis is pne of the best known examples of this, or Anthony Flew who at least came to a Theist viewpoint. I can't remember if it is in the God Delusion or one of his other books that Dawkins says something like ""beware of those like C S Lewis who say that they were once atheists but are now Christians - it is the oldest trick in the book."" However, he fails to explain what the trick is, or why it is any more of a trick that those like Christopher Hitchens who say the opposite, that they used to be religious, but....

Stephen Gould was, though himself an atheist, happy to consider Science and religion as ""non-overlapping magisteria"". For this, of course, he was at times derided by his more militant atheist colleagues for the heresy of offering succour to religion.

I'll give you a further reason why, if you value the integrity of science (like I do) you should be very cautious about Dawkins. It is because he abuses science to make claims that are not justifiable by science, in attemtps to shore up his hatred of religion. He was a truly laughable appointment to a chair of the public engagement in science, a mistake not made with the appointment of his successor Jim Al-Khalili, an atheist I have great respect for.

So much so that [a survey of British scientists which did not even mention Dawkins](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/richard-dawkins-atheism-criticism-atheist-study-rice-university-science-scientists-a7389396.html) drew a lot of comment on him, largely negative.

So it actually seems that not only can Dawkins not put together very well thought-through arguments about religion, but you probably need to be cautious in what he claims for science, too!"
121,eomtgqp,"Thank you! I can tell OP has never had to manage a household and do childcare. These kind of pampered and entitled boys will then be the first to call their wife lazy and demand she also work.....what ALWAYS ends up happening and is the case in every marriage I know that has a working wife......is that the wife then works and also is responsible for every household and childcare chore whilst the husband simply works. 

A sad result of working our moms and sisters like work mules is that boys are brought up not knowing and understanding the true value of what they do and they don't think it's deserving of much appreciation or thanks. Meanwhile they expect us to kiss their feet because they bring home the bacon because of the way Muslim children are brought up to revere their working dads."
122,fywg6nh,"... Please don't assume my stance on that actually. I am well aware that many muslim parents are kind and give their children religious freedom.
 I've met many happy muslim women too, they're not hard to find. My cousins who I adore are muslim women, I grew up surrounded by... muslim women. My mother is a muslim women. My aunt, several friends, heck my brother who I love is a muslim. And many of them are very happy. However, the topic of this post isn't ""Tell me all the happy muslims you know"", it's discuss the religious face covering ban. Which I did. I did not get a choice. That is it.
I don't think I'll respect somebody's way of life is they're a cannibal... A rapist? What if they're homophobic... I disagree with that and I wouldn't respect it. There are many nuances to 'respecting' people's way of life."
123,fqg1d3w,"There’s something to be said about people who want to live truly, yet they cannot undo the shackles of their cultures. 

Cultures which take the purity of the religion and turn into bondage. 

I wanted to obey my parents, but they both had issues. Dont ask me which. I dont know exactly. But they both neglected me. My father said “islam gives me the right to kill you if i like.” I just wonder why i never thoufht of leaving the faith because, what kind of god would let fathers kill their children on a whim. 

Don’t bring Abraham into this. Abraham one day promised God to sacrifice that which he loved the most. And God didn’t want to let His Prophet’s promise go unfulfilled.

God called on Abraham to fulfill his promise and Abraham, though torn, blindfolded himself and held true to his word. It was God who saved Abraham’s son. Then God said, “never again swear to Me an oath like this for you will be unable to keep it.”

Anyway, my father, i know he loved me, its just, how can you be so distant? And then claim that Islam says children must to this this and this for the parents?

Does Islam say that children are your slaves and that parents are given free reign? 

Muslims are unable to hold themselves together. Muslim children are told “jannah is beneath the feet of your mother,” muslim daughter are told to be patient with sexual abuse in their families. 

My aunt was burned alive by her husband. And he still walks free. 

It is only after we take responsibility for ourselves and understand that everything has a certain degree of respect and dignity which must be upheld. 

If not, people cannot break out of the terrible jahiliyya they are living in. 

Muslims have become backwards. Even though there is a Hadith clearly prohibiting Muslims from going into places where there is a plague, or if they in places of plagues, they are prohibited from leaving that area so as to stem the flood of death among people, Muslims say things like “it doesn’t affect Muslims.”

Do Muslims not breathe? Does poison not kill Muslims? Do Muslims not burn when they put their hands into fire?

Miracles are one thing. But you are common people, who cannot even make peace in your own homes. How could fire not burn you? How can covid19 not affect you?

Take precautions because you may not receive a miracle to help you. 

This is the kind of thing that holds Muslims down. Refusal to change."
124,fqpl8uw,That's why you see light skin and mixed people all over Africa near Europe. First is was the Roman's but it was only a small area compared to the conquest of the Calphates.

Nobody has accepted these scripture by examining and coming to their own conclusions, but they accepted it by coercion since from childhood Muslim children are beaten like slaves, their inquisitive minds are coerced with fear of implacable Allah fear of hellfire, they are told to never question the wisdom of the scripture and by time they become Proper Muslims or in other words traumatized and indoctrinated person.

Just because our cultures say to act like slaves towards our parents, doesn‘t mean we should. She‘s someone who deserves more than this, she has a right to be respected, especially if her parents don‘t respect her at all and treat her like a toy.

127,dm4wb2a,"Well it's presented on here that all women are only breeding with 5% of men- easy enough to test, for example I live in china and currently not all Chinese people share literally the same fathers- the incest rate and birth defects caused by that would be off the chart

Also according to this sub there is a causation effect with feminism and this inevitable incest rate- but it is not in either china or the west- the country's with tinder and tantan (Chinese tinder but anyone can be on it)

However, if you look at incest rates in Muslim countries- countries that follow a more incel view on women- they do not choose their partner, rape is not a crime for the man but is a crime for the women, arranged marriage is encouraged, women are sold as slaves, men are typically married in all communities 
- there is a VERY high incest rate, in many countries as high as 40% of Muslim children are the products of incest, that would go in line more with an incel logic of fewer genetic source primes or at least a diluted pool, which has actually lead to birth defects in many Muslim countries 

It's pretty counter intuitive actually to what is implied 

So, even if we agree with the premise that all women are whores and want to fuck chads, they must actually be having their betas children or the incest rate would be higher- simple has that "
128,fuq3ydp,"I believe that Hijab should be taught and encouraged for both genders at a young age so the Muslim children are not shocked about openly practicing Islam. No place is perfect, trying to please your fellow Mankind is stupid so you should thrive to please Allah SWT. My family has lived in many places, some had few Muslims and some had many Muslims.   
My daughter is learning to be confident in openly practicing Islam &amp; observing Hijab despite her environment &amp; peers. She knows what society pushes on girls &amp; women and it naturally disgusts her.  

How can young women accomplish anything in a society that pushes having the right body or the right skin complexion or the right mimicking of other females is more important than their own mental &amp; physical health? Women should be ""marketable"" and willing to put themselves on display. And young women learn these things and it causes them a life of misery &amp; bitterness because they spent the majority of their life pleasing others, not pursuing what they want or having tons of potential but nobody around them gave a damn about that because they only saw a pretty face &amp; a nice body.   
We didn't wait for her to start puberty because we knew her environment &amp; her peers would chip away at her confidence in observing Hijab or being a Muslim even before she becomes an adult. You can't establish anything if   
I have seen some Muslim parents do what you are talking about and they catch hell trying to teach anything about Islam to their children. These parents are also the ones who talk smack about parents who do teach their children about Islam then cry or get angry when their children don't appear to be Muslim.  Insha'Allah, if the Muslim parents are not serious about Islam then their children are not going to practice Islam."
129,fsjzf4e,"Your soul is now in your right hand meaning you are now responsible for your own actions. You now know that what is expected of you as a Muslim and observing Hijab is not for your parents, it's for the Pleasure of AllahSWT. Your parents will still be asked about how they raised &amp; treated you and they can still heed you to observe Hijab because they are your fellow sister &amp; brother in Islam (even though they are your parents). Your right on your Muslim parents is being educated as a Muslim.

https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20064/rights-of-children

So really Muslims can't say their Muslim parents ""forced"" them because Muslim parents are obligated to teach their children Islam. Muslim parents can not abuse their children however they do have the right to discipline their children while they are old enough to reason if Insha'Allah they were not performing the Salat or Fasting (if able to) or other forms of worship. At the end of the day, your Muslim parents were trying to make sure you were on the right path and that you are able to stay on it so you can be successful on the Day of Judgement. 

I personally don't say my parents ""forced"" me to be Christian because it now feels disrespectful towards them. I can't down my parents for Christianity was all they followed and I was their child so they were going to teach me to be a Christian.  Like your folks taught you how to be a Muslim."
130,fj6dwxg,"I don't agree with your mom's methods however she is a Muslim. You backbiting her on Reddit is very hypocritical.  
You have the right to rant about your parents however never say they ""forced"" you to do something that is actually what Muslim parents are supposed to teach their Muslim children. It's your right upon your Muslim parents to be educated as a Muslim and as imperfect as their methods may have been, they tried.  


Who's to say that your idea of teaching the observation of Hijab is correct because insha'Allah one day you will be a mother and you could have negative results from your methods.  Your own children may rebel against observing the Hijab due to lack of consistency &amp; discipline. Even though you gave them a choice in the matter, who's to say they will be successful especially when the whole topic of observing Hijab is seemingly shallow &amp; trivial in your eyes. Do you expect them to follow something that you have no knowledge of?   
They grow up thinking that you and their father were ""weak"" and ""inconsistent"". You left them to their own devices and they could resent you for that as well.   
So be careful about what you preach because it can come back to bite you."
131,fn6oux6,"Hijab apologists seems to gloss over the fact that Muslim children are told or exposed to ""Islamic"" truths  like : You will spend 10,000 years of torment in hell for every hair that shows, boiling lead will be poured on your scalp , you will be hung by hooks going through your boobs for dressing lewdly, hell is full of women more than men etc etc"

134,evmqfbm,"In Malaysia, an Uztaz once preached that women who were raped because she wasn’t wearing hijab deserves it.

You're right there are prejudices against LGBT people but like aren't super Christian people very prejudiced towards them too? It's not just Islam. You also talked about 'hijab' and how it's not a choice. It is expected of a Muslim woman to wear it when she reaches a certain age, however no woman I know was forced to wear it against her will because that is also against Islam. You also talked about how Muslim parents are very controlling of their children, that's actually more of a cultural thing rather than an Islamic thing. You can find Asian parents that are controlling and Arab parents that are controlling and others that aren't. mmm the dreaded Sharia law. Sharia law means a Muslim's right to pray, fast and practice his religion that's sharia. Sharia law also tells a Muslim to follow the law of the land that you're on and respect it. 

I would love to chat with you more and talk more about Islam and these differences. 

Have a great day!"
136,ebz5023,"&gt;That’s the whole point - there’s no such thing as a choice when society is peer pressing you into “choosing” to put it on and ostracizing you for taking it off.

In the West there's also the peer pressure to go study and get a degree, there's the peer pressure to get on social media, there's the peer pressure to get you driving license and a car, ... does this mean all these things aren't choices being made, albeit under peer pressure? So long as you're not being forced to do something and the repercussions of not doing it isn't life threatening or life changing, it is a choice.

How do you explain then that many Moroccan women don't wear hijabs if this peer pressure is prominent and heavy? You even say that her little sister doesn't wear a hijab, that's a choice she made. I'm not claiming all women who wear hijabs do so out of their own choice without any pressure from family and society, but not all women are being pressured into wearing a hijab.

Edit: If you ever watch media in Morocco, be it news or some Moroccan series/soap, it's a 50/50 divide of women wearing hijabs to wearing no hijabs, even closer to 40/60 I'd say. 

This peer pressure I'm talking about usually comes from the older generation, the younger generation doesn't care about what others wear or not.

&gt;It’s not a choice, it’s an indoctrination to eventually accept that women are all of those things and so they must choose to not be those things willingly by accepting the scarf in the first place.

You're acting as if Muslim parents are hard core imams preaching every day about the duties one has to please God. I'll tell you, it's not like that. The peer pressure I'm talking about is the disapproving look the dad gives, because most of the time the dad doesn't care or isn't allowed to care from the mother, and the stern rebukes the mother gives from time to time.

If you think that Muslim parents tell their children to wear modestly to please God and to enter heaven daily or weekly, or even monthly, then I must disappoint you here. Most of the time, and I'm talking about North Africa and Turkey, it's nothing like that."
137,e5dm02l,"Why can the Amish daughter leave, but not the Muslim daughter? They both ""can"" leave, but, especially if they're underage, practically they can't. There's no difference in that regard.

Also, how many Muslim parents are actually dressing their daughters in burqas instead of something like a hijab or other garment that shows the face? Is this a widespread issue?"
138,duh8ct1,"I don't think she was at all trying to argue that every muslim parents are forcing their kids to wear the hijab.  She even used words like *many* women, or *some* women, as well at stating very clearly at the beginning that she was only speaking from her specific experience.  I don't think a reply saying ""yeah but not all women are forced"" is really necessary here, especially considering that the only reason she posted her comment in the first place was a response to that view in the first place. 

Also not sure what you were trying to say with your PhD comment...Did you think that her mention of her a PhD was meant to imply that she thought she was the only woman in the city who has one..?  She was only bringing it up to make the point that even though she is clearly accomplished, complications with her family and religion still end up making it hard for her to make an otherwise basic decision of what to wear.  

You seem to be projecting quite a bit and assuming she was implying a lot of stuff that she wasn't.  And even as nicely written as it is, it's kind of incredibly condescending at the same time."

2. Someone's parent's country of origin isn't a valid reason to treat them like shit no matter how old you are.

Try again.

&gt; You don't have to do anything. You can be as weird and out of pocket as you want in America. But you can't expect to do that, and then have everyone ignore it.

None of these things should be weird. None of these things justify being cruel towards a person. No matter how old you are.

&gt; You don't both get to wear a Hijab, and have everyone pretend you're not wearing it.

I've never suggested anyone ignore it. I've suggested they not be a dick to people over it.

How about you go tell /r/Atheism that their children deserve derision for not being Christian in a majority Christian country?"

141,dhdqig7,"You keep talking about Turkey..One of the most if not the most secular majority Muslim countries. There's a lot of Muslim girls with strict Muslim parents from other countries who are cringing at what you are saying about American Muslims having a choice. Yea, they have a choice... Don't wear it and get ostracized and shunned from the family. Or they can wear it like a good little Muslim girl respecting her parents wishes. People like you aren't helping Islam or Muslims at all. 

Go to Miami or San Fran and ask yourself if all these 16-18 year old girls are happily requesting to wear hijab. You really should be ashamed of yourself. You should be fighting against what you call ""conservative parents"" to help Islam go through its much needed revolution to be able to survive in the West. You should not be defending women wearing hijab as if the majority are wearing it on their own free will, with no repercussions if they remove it or never wear it. You should know this is simply not true.

Either you are ignorant to the facts or you are so sheltered in your little bubble that you have no idea how life is outside of it. 

Turkey has managed to evolve over the centuries. An 8 year old girl wearing a hijab in school in America will never be Turkish. Turkish Muslim parents are not the problem. Kids of Turkish parents like you aren't helping the problem either. 

But hey, congrats on being born Turkish and having reasonable parents who don't force their religion down your throat. Must be nice, but don't make it seem like this is the case the majority of the time. "
142,dhdt8vr,"Still trying to compare the two yea? Again, your evidence is anecdotal, based on only your experience, and you feel that means this must be the case around the country.

They both have progressives? Again, stop comparing the two. The % of progressives in Islam is NOWHERE near the % of Christian progressives, in this country or elsewhere. 

They're not the same. No one is worried about Jehovah Witnesses or Mormons killing themselves in the name of their God and taking people with them. Islam is clearly a problem right now.

You have your experience and you think that's the case around the country, I get it. You think the religions are the same, completely ignoring all the facts, that's fine.

Why would you ""blame"" being atheist on that experience? If only one religion was trying to indoctrinate you, are you saying you would be a firm believer of that religion? 

I don't know. I'm done replying. I'm clearly not going to convince you to look outside of your single experience, and look at the majority of experiences. You want to be vocal about how easy going your Muslim parents are, making it seem like this is the case for the majority of Muslim families. Unfortunately, you're wrong. I think you know it deep down, but for some reason you'd rather defend Muslim American kids wearing hijab. Please stop saying the majority of Muslim American kids have a choice to wear it or not. Being threatened with hell and getting completely shunned from your family and community for not wearing it does not mean they have a choice. That's what's called an ultimatum. You are not on their side. You are not helping liberate them. You are becoming part of the problem. Congrats

He didn't have to serve us pork, he didn't have to serve vegan option. she doesn't wear a hijab bc she doesn't want to and her parents don't make her. the assumption that all muslim parents are these fundamentalist oppressing shitlords is ridiculous. i dont doubt that there are strict controlling muslim families, but there are controlling families across religion. she comes from a nice, good, considerate family. the fact that her and her family have to deal with automatically being assumed as bad people because of their faith is ridiculous. "
144,dhzo02y,"Well, I too live in Turkey and seeing that there is no answer so far, I can answer them if you want.
&gt;Do Turkish women follow the rule where they cover themselves?

Depends on the person. Majority of Turkish women don't follow it, it is a rather conservative thing to do. Ones that follow that rule wears hijab, niqab is really rare and other types of islamic clothing is non-existent.
&gt;Does that change if they live in the US?

Well, that covering rule is not something enforced by law and it is usually a personal choice so I don't think it would change.
&gt;I heard that, depending on the culture, Muslim parents are emberrassed if their friends or extended family finds out. Is Turkey like that?

From what? Leaving the religion? If it is, well, I don't think so. I mean Turkey is a really diverse about being religious, an ordinary Turkish parent don't really minds it and I think a conservative one, rather than being embarressed, would try to convert their child back and get help from friends and extended family. I don't think they'll try to cover it.
Also about the death penalty, Turkey is not ruled by Sharia law, there isn't any vigilantes or some sort of group that tries to enforce it and certainly a family member won't try to execute it by himself. Most Turks don't even aware of that rule."
145,dileir1,"I think most female British Muslims growing up in the UK are oppressed, but don't dare speak about it.  Why risk take a beating (or worse) from your father, uncles and maybe even your brothers for not wearing a hijab, or dating the cute English boy at school? 

A short list of cultural wonders female Muslims may enjoy:

* fgm
* forced marriage
* forced marriage overseas (kidnapping and passports taken)
* forced marriage to another family member
* any combination of the above
* beatings for not wearing a hijab
* beatings
* rape
* being caged
* acid attacks / rape / honor killings for dating/marrying outside of the family or race
* forced to fast (ramadan) during pregnancy (why a large percentage of Muslim children are born with birth defects depending on the month they were conceived SPEZ:  this may also be from the inbreeding) 
* there are too many wonders to list, but these are the most enriching

I think some female Muslims get brainwashed / sucked into the ideology (females can be cucks too) and sounds like these women were - but I'm pretty sure that overall they get the bad side of the deal and are just terrified to do anything about it.

Another story that came out during the Rotherham rape scandal was that council members were tipping off ""community leaders"" to the locations of female safe houses - where Muslim brides or brides to be had run away to.  

All of this makes me sympathetic to female Muslims too scared to speak out or run away - even here in the UK the government is not on their side.  They risk being cast out from their family permanently or even death.

This is why I am always amazed when feminists defend sharia law.  Its like Jewish people defending Nazis."
146,fv2tbh9,"It applies to other groups too, they isolate themselves using a common trait. Being born in a muslim home, that's what immediately came to mind. Majority of muslims never really connect with the people of the nonmuslim country they came to, they ultimately dont care about other cultures and beliefs -- it's all about broadcasting and preserving their own.

I hear the same stories by muslims, of how muslims are oppressed everywhere in the world for no reason but their beliefs, because they are the true religion, and the rest of the world is out to get them. Yet in muslim countries, you have nonmuslims or muslims of minority sects who are treated like they are inferior and sometimes killed by muslim mobs, yet their hardships are never brought up because only muslim tragedy/deaths is what matters.

So they isolate themselves and usually only form bonds with other muslims. A lot of the younger people are not like that (ex. Canada) -- public schools are diverse and you are forced to interact with people from everywhere...but more and more muslim parents are now putting their kids into religious schools to shield them from any nonmuslim influence of public schools. As they get older it also usually becomes the same story as their parents, where they become more religious and don't mingle with nonmuslims unless necessary (work usually).

Basically muslims are not really supposed to intermingle with nonmuslims, except for the purposes of making Islam look good and eventually recruit them into the religion. That's it, you can preach your religion but don't let any other beliefs influence you because they are *obviously* wrong.

You are taught to live in a bubble. Most participate exclusively in muslim events, they have muslim only social media groups and muslim speakers they prominently follow. They often live in an echo chamber with sprinkles of victimhood.

Note: Muslim women can't marry outside of the religion because the husband's belief sets would take over the household and get passed down to the kids, but muslim men can marry outside religion so they can impose islamic teachings in the house and on their kids.

Its an endless cycle of self-segregation."
147,eyshz7e,"My non-muslim parents are open-minded people but still not very exposed to many muslims or arab people in general and have a limited scope of understanding about the religion and i also fear they would reject or judge me BECAUSE they are afraid i would end up in an abusive marriage or mistreated or oppressed. And my family is super liberal feminist supporting. My dad encouraged me to be self-sufficient and independent, play contact sports, dress how i want (but respectably- wasnt an issue i wore ugly boys clothes half my teenage years), make my own money and pay my own bills and make my own decisions. I lived with my parents for a year after i dropped out of uni and i paid rent and my own phone and gas bills and occasionally pitched in for groceries, while i was just waitressing. Now i live alone in a country on the other side of the world and havent been able to visit home in almost 3 years. So they love me and respect my autonomy but i dont blame them for having some stereotypes and fear about my well-being if i become more open about my newfound faith.

I try to be optimistic and stay focused on the true goals of my life and as a new Muslim, but the stories about converts getting taken advantage of or abused, born-Muslims having toxic family relationships, it makes me afraid. I want to be happy in my marriage and family life and raise my own kids well inshallah."
148,epwhy3q,"The Muslims in this case are responding to LGBT education in schools. Attempting to oust LGBT people from the curriculum is oppression, reminiscent of Thatchers section 28. 

They are attempting to deny LGBT people their rights under the Equalities Act. And your freedoms stop where my rights begin. 

Muslim parents are not being oppressed by their children going through the national curriculum."
149,epbwk45,"I think the biggest issue with Islam (and also in general with religious fundamentalism, but specifically with Islam) - and this accounts to both genders - is that there is no self-responsibility involved. I remember reading that joking comment in an online discussion once: ""If a european guy takes a gun and wants to shoot someone, he aims and then fires. If a muslim takes the gun, he will close his eyes, pray and just shoot and may Allah will decide if the bullet hits"".

&amp;#x200B;

While that is an hyperbole, that's the entire attitude. Muslim children are kept at an infantile development stage and never get to grow out. Thus you see adults acting like 13 years old essentially. No self-responsibility, no critical thought, no introspection, no own moral compass. And as the girls get oppressed, the boys have no self-control and behave like toddlers who require outsiders to tell them where their boundaries are - most boundaries are obviously created by the Quran (which is also why I think muslims are drastically more likely to commit violent crimes in western countries).

At the same time in the west there is secularism and libertarianism and having that means people do need to have self-responsibility. Only in the recent \~20-30 years this started to change due to governments intervening itself more and more in peoples lifes - just like religion does."
150,do77lzs,"&gt; If Muslim women have a problem in the west from being oppressed by the family, then we have a much bigger integration problem than i originally thought.

Oh absolutely. Just because a muslim family migrates to another country doesn't mean they're going to change their ways at home, behind closed doors. If anything they become even *more* conservative and desperate, trying their hardest to ""shield"" their children from all the kafir (non-muslim) influence. 

To most girls raised in Islam from birth, it's borderline impossible for them to even *realize* that leaving is an option. They are brainwashed to the point where the thought cannot occur to them, and if they bring it up then their 2 options are either to get disowned or lit on fire - yes, some muslim parents are crazy enough to do that in a western world. Their religion is their law. Sure they'll get arrested, but the damage to their daughter will be done. 


"
151,fpm1uez,"Muslim parents are abuse apologists. Especially, in south asian culture. I am Pakistani-American (so my parents are from Pakistan and I was born and raised here in America ), and my parents think that if you cover up as a woman you will not face harassment or abuse. The one time I told them about an instance of a man following me in his car while I was walking and I hid in between cars to avoid him, they gave that response.  Keep in mind, they think I am always fully covered and despite this they said that (I was not fully covered since I lie about what I wear, but it should not have happened to me regardless) . 

I am so so so deeply sorry that happened to you. FUCK him and FUCK Patriarchy  for letting this happen.

161,dk6bmcj,"Well since I was a young child I had always been a science person so I never was religious person, my parents weren't strict with me religiously either, even now they aren't , they pretty let me do what I want with my life now. Both of my parents are fairly religious and traditional, particular my mum who has become more religious as she got older , my dad has been more too but just a bit not as much as my mum. 

As for the news, well you know that the sultan implemented the sharia law here in 2014, which created both national &amp; international outrage, I wasn't here when it was first implemented back in May 2014 I think (?) one of my friends said that people were scared &amp; shit, guys stopped wearing shorts and girls &amp; women started wearing hijabs for fear of getting fined &amp; punished , thankfully there is no dress code law after all and things calmed down with that. Then later when Christmas celebration took place at the end of that year, the religious authorities saw some muslims wearing Santa hats, they started banning Christmas and fine those who celebrate Christmas. Muslim parents are now forced to send their children to islamic religious schools or face imprisonment &amp; fine. Muslims who don't attend Friday prayer would get fined or imprisonment. Shops during Friday must be closed until the prayer is finished. Restaurants aren't allowed to serve anymore during Ramadan, the list goes on. This all started after that stupid sharia law got implemented. 

Still even before the sharia law Brunei was quite a religious &amp; conservative. After independence in 1984 things got more &amp; more islamic , alcohol &amp; clubs got banned, Muslim women have to wear headscarves when working for public bodies, etc and recently the sharia law. I just hope things won't get worst than now, and hope the oldest son of the sultan won't be conservative as his father who is currently the sultan when his son takes his place in 2019 , and make some progressive &amp; modernising changes.

The muslims here are okay, tho some can be bothersome , the older generation are conservative and more religious while the younger generation are liberal and becoming less religious &amp; secular especially in this decade, most because of the  influence from the outside world via the internet &amp; media. 

I turned athiest because I'm a science person and religion is nothing but myth and superstition, I couldn't take islam seriously because stuff like god, angels , Adam &amp; Eve, genies and all that magic stuff which aren't scientific at all, which was why I never was religious but still was a muslim because it was what I identified myself as. It was until 2 years ago I left the religion and just didn't care. Until now I realised it was the best decision I have ever made in my life, I also now can follow science fully without not accepting some because they aren't compatible with islam :) 

EDIT: my bad for the multiple comments, connection was so laggy"
162,fykl0ac,"&gt; I'm not sure how you can claim that Muhammad and his followers were the ""good guys"" with the apparently contradictory evidence from the time, and the fact that they were unrelenting toward people who would not convert.

Again, totally false. What contradictory evidence? You have a really annoying habit of saying vague things without substance or evidence. No one was ever forced to convert to Islam during the time of the prophet. He enshrined religious freedom as a core principle during his lifetime. One of the most commonly recited verses that all Muslim children are aware of is “to you your religion, to me mine.” When the Muslims finally entered Mecca towards the end of the prophet’s life, he forgave everyone who persecuted and tortured the Muslims except one person, whom he forgave, but asked that he leave the city. No one was EVER forced to convert. Stop speaking in vagueries and admit you don’t know anything about Islam.

&gt; There are no endorsements of violence ... like there are in the Quran toward non-Muslims

You have the opportunity to make a convert out of me. Show me these endorsements of violence towards non-Muslims in the Quran. Be specific."
163,en09rlh,"Please be careful when your father does come home.  Make sure some close friends know what's up.  I wouldn't out it past anyone who will come home from a trip to refrain from also inflicting violence. I hope you stay safe.

Muslim parents are the worst. They pretend they did their children a favor by birthing them. Either it was accidental or even if it was a planned pregnancy,  they birthed us for their own eats.  We didn't get a say. And if they support us financially it is quite literally their obligation.  Forget 18 years,  a lot of Muslims stay home after that she.  18 is the Western age of maturity and moving out but for Muslims,  we usually get trapped into staying for one reason or another go 'take care of them like they took care of us'"
164,ed3qhwr,"Or India, or even Arab states themselves. It’s not like Syria or Saudi Arabia or Egypt are modern bastions of freedom.

How many dissidents locked up in Egypt? How many dead in Syria? "
165,dree5vb,"&gt; That's definitely true, but the solution isn't to force them to adopt a fairly foreign and unwanted form of government. That will most likely lead to protests, violence, and a coup

So what to do? Do we allow them to formally institute honor rapes into law? I really don't know what the answer to that question is. Even if you try to teach them actual sharia, they will reject it. I recall al-Qaeda thought they would find a sympathetic friend among in Waziristan, only to find that the locals there were executing Arabs who tried to teach them sharia. They weren't interested because they preferred their own sharia over anything Islam could offer them. But in their minds, they were more Muslim than any other Muslim.

&gt; Hmm I head Malaysia is also becoming less secular not at the pace of Turkey but still shifting is that true?

Absolutely true. Its difficult to know what is going to happen in the future. Even many Muslim parents are taking their kids out of public schools and putting them into private schools so they can get at least some math and science education. Islamic studies is now something like 30% of the curriculum and there is pressure on the government to increase that. There are even concerns about he safety of the Minister for Education because he thinks 30% is too much.

A big part of the problem is the secular party in government. They see PAS, the main Islamist party, as their only political rival and they hope to defeat PAS by becoming PAS. Meanwhile, the other secular parties are gaining popularity."
166,dq4a902,"Muslim children are dressed in Hijabs for modesty and it is also done to ensure men essentially don’t get excited and rape somebody.

Explain your values a bit more to me? Why is this any different from stereotypical women roles, clothing etc?"
167,dixu9hv,"I expect Muslims to be apologists for their religion, that makes perfect sense. I, in a way, expect well-meaning liberals to confuse criticism of Islam with criticism of Muslims on the whole and for them to get defensive on their behalf. That makes sense in the current political climate of widespread anti-Muslim bigotry. 

What I don't understand are ex-Muslim Islam apologists. Recently an ex-Muslim told me the brutalization and enslavement of the Yazidi was a symptom of 'politics' and not religion. The time and again, centuries old, repeated religious persecution (this time) perpetrated by Isil was the result of 'politics'. Is it that difficult, really, to see that just because Muslim supremacists use politics to their advantage and recruit young men with political grievances, preying on them like a cult and instilling their ideology, does not mean that their existence and their actions are the results of politics? I can't imagine it is that difficult, and yet, apparently, it is. 

Maybe these people don't care about the past, and certainly, don't care for the future. Maybe they imagine history began in 1900 or with the creation of the CIA or something, I have no idea. 

Islam has a supremacist streak that began with Muhammad and is, unfortunately, codified into the religion. To deny that is to deny reality, history, religious jurisprudence, everything. It's to be on another planet. Violent supremacist Islam, sometimes with the backing of entire nations, other times by small groups of individuals, have brutalised Muslims and non-Muslims, alike, for centuries. The reason why it is not going away is that the supremacist nature of Islam has never been successfully curbed religiously, politically or socially by the majority of Muslims around the world. 

Why do you think, the majority of us here in the west with western Muslim parents are still in the closet about our religious beliefs? This is a symptom of the wider historical problem of supremacism in Islam. 

Thankfully, even Muslim are now calling out the ideologies that underpin this violence. The desires and the very long histories that inform them. [Calling them out for being supremacist in nature](http://www.baytarrahmah.org/media/political-communiques/2017/2017-22-05_Declaration-on-Humanitraian-Islam/2017-22-05_Ansor-Declaration-on-Humanitarian-Islam_info.pdf). 

&gt; “Muslims face a choice between starkly different visions of the future. Will they strive to recreate the long-lost ideal of religious, political and territorial unity beneath the banner of a Caliphate—and thus seek to restore Islamic supremacy—as reflected in their communal memory and still firmly entrenched within the prevailing corpus, and worldview, of orthodox, authoritative Islam? Or will they strive to develop a new religious sensibility that reflects the actual circumstances of our modern civilisation, and contributes to the emergence of a truly just and harmonious world order, founded upon respect for the equal dignity and rights of every human being?”

I am hopeful of the future because there are well meaning Muslims and non-Muslims who understand what the problem is. These people who want to deflect attention, overplay politics and whatever else and downplay religion like their life depends on it, are a huge problem. Muslim, non-Muslim, ex-Muslim, whatever whoever they are, I wish they would take a walk. This issue is too important for them to constantly clutter the conversation with their bs. 

I personally like to look at it like all forms of supremacism. It's just another form of supremacism. You don't defeat supremacists by constantly pretending they're something else. You address the issue head on. You pick apart history, criticise the past, criticise the actions of our heroes, change the laws and learn to love your fellow man. 

Excuse the typos and the veering around to different topics, I need to sleep. 

"
168,g05wnn2,"I feel like the reason why some Muslim parents are violent is that they had a rough childhood themselves. Many Muslims come from lower-income households. Mainly because our countries have corrupt leaders and are unstable. It's also similar for Muslims in the West since they usually come from immigrant families that at times are not that well educated and are also financially not that strong.

If you look at the Sahabah (Companions of Prophet Muhammad P.B.U.H). They treated their children kindly. It is also considered as being a great reward to smile at your children. Prophet Muhammad P.B.U.H encouraged us to be patient with our children.

Also, in terms of the doubt part. The Quran encourages us to criticize it because it is the truth. So kids at a young age (especially teens) questioning the Quran and Islam is a good sign. Since, if the parents respond back in a kind and informative manner. Chances are that their faith will grow stronger. Personally, my faith keeps getting stronger, because I challenge the Quran and the prophecy of Prophet Muhammad P.B.U.H. Yet, up till now, I am still not able to disapprove of any of it and never will. There is just too much evidence to back the Quran and that Prophet Muhammad P.B.UH as the final messenger of God (Allah).

And yes I also agree every Muslim parent should teach their kids to be Muslims. It's their responsibility to do so."
169,dhyrcrr,"This. The Protestant Reformation could only happen because the Christian scriptures allow for it. Martin Luther believed that the Catholic Church had strayed too far from the teachings of Jesus, so he ""returned to Christianity's roots.""

In Islam, the same reformation is happening. It's called Wahhabism. The reasons Islam can't be reformed into something more peaceful are these:

1. The Quran is claimed to be the eternal, unchanging word of Allah. Changing even one word is blasphemy

2. The Quran claims itself to be perfectly clear in its message

3. The Quran commands unspeakable violence against the unbelievers, and to act peaceful until there are enough Muslims to subjugate an area.

4. Islam silences any voices of dissent. Muslim children are raised to trust everything their Imam says as true, and to not question it"
170,f6snsdf,"I don’t think this is true. This was posted early this year and they haven’t cancelled these lessons at all. The Muslim parents are still protesting this today and police were involved to escort the protesters after it started to get violent.

171,dudh9zv,"It never experienced an elightenment. Western cultures had to adapt to humanism, and make themselves attractive in an era when people had generally accepted that people are more important than ideas. The same cannot be said of Islamic cultures. It needs home-grown reform - genuine ideological change, not just trying to pretend it was never violent in the first place. 

The penalty for apostasy under Islam is death. There are many places in the world where the children of Muslim parents are presumed to be Muslim (Malaysia for example). Until either of these two points change, then I will always consider Islam a violent, cruel and detestable religion."
