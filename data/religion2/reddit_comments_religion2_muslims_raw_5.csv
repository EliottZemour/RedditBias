0,fyv46du,"In the US the FBI and other law enforcement convicted a lot of sad losers of terrorism by setting them up but within the law.  They get them talking about bombing etc, get them to take several steps towards the act then arrest.  

At least in the US and among the people I know the Islamic community is not stupid - they know this talk about jihad here can get the arrested so they don't even talk about it. 

As an aside, this is what was done to the left terrorists in the 60s and 70s, the KKK and Militias in 80s and 90s.  There are some people dedicated and smart that are true dangers.  They get rolled up eventually but you start convicting some additional losers to make an example of them.  There have not been any huge acts of terrorism with the current unrest in the US but it will happen.  Then this cycle will repeat as the US government asserts it's monopoly on violence.  This will happen no matter who is in charge."
1,g0dcxsg,"Alright, let's dig into it. Lots to unpack here.

First of all, 

&gt; People criticize Israel and not get called anti-semitic

This is a *whooole* other kettle of fish that I'd rather not get into—another post for another time—but that isn't true. Just look at the [recent scandal around Foodbenders](https://www.blogto.com/eat_drink/2020/07/toronto-restaurant-owner-anti-israel/). TDLR is that local restaurant is pro-Palestine and anti-Israel/anti-Zionist, explicitly because of the atrocities happening in Palestine at the hands of the Israeli government. They are not *anti-Semitic*, they are anti-Israel—but they were still accused of anti-Semitism, protested, and ultimately ""cancelled"": if you poke around their [Instagram channel](https://www.instagram.com/foodbenders/?hl=en), you'll see that they've received loads of threats, and both Ritual and Uber Eats cancelled them as vendors. 

With that out of the way, back to the topic at hand. 

I think what you are getting at is that anyone critical of Islam is *at risk of being deemed* Islamophobic. I will acquiesce that people on the left and far left are sometimes ""excessively woke"", and ready to jump down the throats of others and claim xenophobia. It happens. I won't deny that. 

But.

I think we have to acknowledge that real, overt Islamophobia exists in this country. There is no denying that. Let's take a closer look at the two ""news sources"" cited in OP's article, the ones the cop shared, the ones people have deemed Islamophobic: 

**The first** is titled [SHOCKING video of Radical Islam in Canadian school](http://www.israelvideonetwork.com/shocking-video-of-radical-islam-in-canadian-school/), shared by Israeli Video Network. Let's do a quick [media bias and factcheck](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/israel-video-network/) on this outlet: they are known for extreme right propagandist views, and are marked as a questionable source: ""The content is extremely against Palestine and against liberalism in general. They use strong loaded wording in headlines and publish propaganda"". With that check aside, this video segment and article touches on a few cherrypicked examples of ""Canadian-Muslims behaving badly"", and frames these (factually questionable) incidents as Muslims being a wholesale threat to ""Canadian values"". It covers a Muslim (?) woman who would not let her daughter date a boy, and escalate to the point of harassment, presumably because it goes against her religion—which, okay, not cool mom. But I see that kinda shit everyday in r/insaneparents, from asshole parents of all walks of life, all races, all faiths. Then, the segment moves on to a Muslim man out of Hamilton who ran away to join Jihad and died in an airstrike, and a Mosque in Thornhill, which the anchor claims is 1) showing videos of beheadings to young children (no proof or source), and 2) acting out beheadings as part of a school play, which they do kind of show... with fuzzy, quick-second clips and zero context. Not sure how this is dissimilar from Christian Sunday schools and all the twisted Bible shit they cover, but I digress.

Check out his statement at 2:38 ""The bad news: people with views that run against everything Canada stands for, they are here—and they want to have their way."" This whole ""article"", this whole sentiment, is set up to make Muslims look like some kind of grave threat to the ""Canadian way of life"". I would say this article falls firmly in the ""Islamophobic"" category, versus people ""just asking questions"" or being critical of Islam—would you agree?

**The second** article the cop shared, mentioned in OP's article, is a Tomi Lahren (red flag number one) piece titled [""Civilization Jihad"" Is Here""](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/11/02/tomi_lahren_civilization_jihad_is_here.html). [Fact check time](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-clear-politics/)! "" They often publish factual information that utilizes loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes) to favor conservative causes"". Okay. So more credible than Israeli Video Network. Let's dive in. 

You can read a transcript of her segment so you don't have to watch the video, thank god. Her TLDR is that Muslim people are here and ready to kill us. ""We've got radical Islamic terrorists ready, willing, and honored to kill us on planes, trains and automobiles with knifes, guns, explosives and trucks. And we've got federal judges, top Democrats, and bleeding heart kumbaya liberals placing Islamic sensitivity, diversity options, and political correctness over reality, American lives, and national security."" Admittedly, looking at the [Wikipedia article which lists Islamic extremist attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Islamist_terrorist_attacks), there have been a few in America over the last two decades: 9/11 being the most prominent, and a handful of small attacks interspersed (Orlando Pulse, San Bernadino, Chatanooga). But it's not as if Muslim terrorists are a widespread daily threat to American lives. If anything, domestic terrorism—troubled white men with access to guns—is a far greater, more frequent threat, which causes hundreds of times more lives lost, and more of a concern. 

I think I can confidently say this is Islamophobic, too. Tomi is not earnestly or in-good-faith ""asking questions"" or being critical about certain aspects of Islam; she is using hyperbolic language, and an appeal to emotion, to demonize a religion by looking to its worst extreme minority (Jihadists attacking Americans), and dressing it up as a real and dire danger to American citizens. 

Sooooooo. Back to your comment. 

As I mentioned earlier up in the thread, I am atheist, and gay. So I don't particularly like or endorse Islam. But, as a compassionate person, I do feel that good, peaceful, average Muslim folks are up against this very widespread conservative-held idea that Muslim people are bad, spooky, evil, deprived people. And because I come from a demographic that has historically been and is presently persecuted (I've been gay bashed), I feel a camaraderie with them, and a need to call Islamophobia when I see it. 

TLDR Islamophobia exists, cop from OP's article shared Islamophobic sources, cop is probably Islamophobic. Not sure why we're in here playing whataboutery and semantic games about what is and isn't Islamophobia, as it relates to OP's article.

Edit: spelling.

Edit 2: to add please read [u/thejagofire](https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/i2c4af/torontoarea_cop_under_investigation_for_alleged/g042zh9/)'s comment, which if true, this cop is at the very least a racist."
2,fr0lmrm,"&gt;Are you personally taking any steps for any wrong doing done by your religion? 

This would be a valid counter, if I were here asking for some sort of restitution for the wrong done by Muslims/Islam throughout history. But I'm NOT asking for that *(and we'd be here till the heat death of the universe before they could foot the bill of just ONE tyrant alone, forget about the hundreds of others)*, so I'm not seeing how it's rational to ask me what I've done to fix the ""wrongs done"". 

Not that I haven't - I still consider it my personal responsibility to take steps to counter casteism. But it's basically a non-sequitur argument, so why even ask me this.

&gt;You think it’s fair to ask the few “good” muslims to show what they think is right and wrong? 

I think it's fair to expect everyone to not openly support terrorists. I don't recall asking ""good"" muslims (aka ""bad muslims"") to do anything. I expect them to align their moral compass and not give [intellectual covering-fire and apologia](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EH-rgwsU8AEF5tl.jpg) for the radical islamists and the indoctrinated 25%. 

&gt;Do you end up showing it in a meaningful way that does not put your life on the line?

You've touched upon a very ironic point here - people who try to reform most other faiths do not need to put their lives at risk. The fact that any average person who tries to reform Islam faces the very real possibility of being killed is a damning indictment of how widespread and common Islamic radicalization is.

&gt;Facts, everyone is looking out for themselves. This hate speech affects mostly those who cannot think for themselves , and there are lot of them. This kind of stuff just spreads fear. Muslims have been part of this country since the day it was created, there have been partitions. Point is a Normal person (irrespective of religion) is too busy to worry about religion. We are worried about jobs, social security network, medical system.

This is totally true for almost everyone, but the Islamic community is an outlier in this regard. By a large margin. 

That there was stone pelting *exclusively* in Muslim majority areas, against medical personnel and police, ***who were trying to help them*** is only the most recent example that establishes how one ideology has managed to warp enough minds that even their own survival is a secondary priority. Their reaction towards 'social security' and 'medical care' (that was providing them *door-to-door* testing and treatment) was naked hostility. That warped ideology is visible everywhere across India. 

Large segments of Indian Muslim society have been radicalized into vocally (sometimes violently) opposing measures that are objectively good for *everyone*. They engaged in rioting, violence, and murder, over a law that ***didn't even affect them*** - the Citizenship Amendment Act. [Even the ones that didn't engage in violence, ideologically ***supported*** the rioters](https://i.redd.it/59j1ugfhk3h41.png). The Indian Muslim community is literally fighting *against* its own interests, out of sheer bigotry - trying to protect Bangladeshi illegal immigrants in India, who drain subsidies and resources that are meant only for poor Indian citizens - a large chunk of whom are Muslims. If Bangladeshis were kicked out after NRC, Indian Muslims would be the biggest beneficiaries, as there would be more resources to help lift them out of poverty... but no. The vast majority will side with their Ummah rather than their fellow citizens.

&gt;You are bringing up population numbers, would you swap places population wise with muslims at present? 

Would I swap places and be the minority in a country run by Muslims? Well, the first question would be, if India was Muslim-majority, would there be any idea of 'secularism'? The answer can be seen with our two neighbors that used to be part of our country. India is pluralistic only because it is Hindu-majority.

&gt;You have to realize that they are probably more scared by the 75% than us being scared of 25%.

This ""Dara Hua Musalman"" is a dead meme. It's hogwash. They have full freedom to do what they like in India. 

Do you have any basis for claiming 'they are more scared'?

##Do you know how to tell when a community is scared? 

* **When they try to hide their identity.**
* When they pretend to be nonreligious in public.
* When they avoid associating themselves with their faith.
* When they go out of their way to distance themselves from the zealots in their community.
* When they avoid clearly identifiable clothing / symbols.
* When they seldom visit their places of worship.

If anything, it's the *Hindus* who check ALL those boxes. I don't see Muslims doing any of this. Do you think any significant number of Jews in 1940's Germany could behave the way many Muslims do in India? 

Do you see Muslims avoiding keeping beards, or avoiding skullcaps, or not going to the mosque and choosing to pray privately at home? Do you see more Burqas around or fewer? Do you see any reduction in number of mosques with loudspeakers blaring out their prayers at all hours? Are these signs of ***fear***?

And why are they more fearful than any other minority? We have a *handful* of Parsis, a tiny number of Jews, few Buddhists, yet all of them seem to not feel any fear in India at all."
3,fivjth6,"Just about every Muslim engages in Jihad at some point in their life. The word just means “struggle”, and indeed the far more important Jihad in Islam is one that is personal, and focused on the betterment of the self. The lesser jihad, referring to the defence of the Islamic community is not so important. 

And again, the vast majority of Muslims are not terrorists, set your priorities straight."
4,fat2ydv,"Let’s answer this question. You see, many of the things you had read about the atrocious acts that are commited in such states by those people are true. You should know that those people, as your father says, are biggot buffoons and stupid clowns. The leaders in such countries are also stupid clowns that are just in a dire need to be replaced by logical, sane, and benevolent imdoviduals. Whenever the word of god is brought unto context, and a choice is to be made how to take it, we take it as the most strict of strict meanings possible. 

Muhammad himself stated only a few things about Islam, he said that the less we knew, the better off we were, as the teachings of Islam were full of rules that.. some.. if we knew.. they would make our daily lives as humans harder to live by if he explained put much of the knowledge he possessed.

And I get it, you’re a pale guy, can be taken for jewish, christian, anything really. That really doesn’t matter, as muslims, especially in America possess looks of all places in the world. There are even muslims in China, oppressed by the Han majority in a certain region, characteristics of your heart and pillars determine if you are a muslim, but I do get what you mean by the general “muslims are usually tanned arabs.” because they are lol, the middle east has it’s Islamic roots.

Alright, about the assholes that gave you trouble. Dumb folks. Many muslims are, and don’t take that as a bad thing. I’ll draw a parallel with christianity sometime as well in order to have your mind open to options. Muslim folks, when asked about religion, they’re very defensive my friend. Especially due much of the dumb people that take up arms in order to satisfy their own idiocies. The ones that do, they’re terrorists, not muslims. But not all muslim people that take up arms are terrorists, if you get my drift. Soldiers, police officers, there are many muslims with a gun that just simply do work like any other dude.

Alright, now let’s move on to parallel drawing time. You know those medieval times when people were hung by religious christians for being “witches.” Obviously, there are no witches. And that woman, she also did nothing wrong. As people were hunted as witches at the time by dumb folk.. 

That woman, she was killed by pretty much the same dumb folk.. The police officers that basically protected her were muslim, too. Were they not? Likely if this happened in one of those dictatorship ruled regions. If they also were, then point proven. There’s no bad in you, and your friends/those people that immediately square up as their religion is questioned are pretty much behaving idiotically. A common sight that is of religiously muslim boys, maybe also christian boys, is that they gang up and be stupid. Some of that carries on as they are adults if they don’t raise their level of thinking as they grow.

I’ve spent half of my life in the USA, and I’m muslim. I have been called a terrorist, bomber, illegal, “osama,” the list pretty much goes on. But really, the first few times I ignored that type of dialogue. After the next couple of times, I actually had a sit down with those guys, and I really just up and straight answered all the questions they had for me. 

“Aren’t y’all like.. terrorists? Aren’t muslims terrorists..?”
Me: “Pfft. No. I don’t consider any terrorist a muslim. If you kill others in order to cause terror, then you are not a muslim. Period.”

“Hey, don’t you like.. Don’t y’all marry your cousins and shit?”
Me: “That’s incest. Many dumb middle eastern folks and people from Alabama have that in common.”

“You can’t eat pork? Why?”
Me: “Yes. 1. I think that shit’s nasty. 2. It’s forbidden, religious ruling.” 

“Don’t middle eastern leaders, like leaders such as you guys’ pope person tell you to cause violence?”
Me: “I don’t listen to famous preachers and religious leaders like that. They’re buffoons. Just like the pastors that spend church money to buy private jets, as well as mother teresa that didn’t pay for her food.”

There was a very friendly christian boy who was one of my dear friends. Even gifted me a bible lol. My dad recommended I read it in order to defend the muslim religion better as the boy and I woul often debate about religous topics. It was a blast lol. Sometimes he thought he got the best of me, and sometimes I thought I won. But honestly, I was never looking to debate, so I’d have a breath of relief once they were over. Much fun, they were.

There was one dumb bully, too. I ended up finding a good moment and exchanging workout tips from for helping him with math school work.

After some time spent together, we all became really great friends. There were a few other muslims at my school, I made friends with them, too. I had good times. They all had realised muslim folks are all fine people, that we are all just people in the end. And idiot comes in all religions, shapes, and sizes.

I believe that you should value the wit and intellectual capacity god chose to bestow you with. Be calm, don’t rush into anything. Btw, gossiping and false spreading of information; lying.. that is a sin. A really bad one. Those dudes that lie pretty much have a well place in hell if they don’t change their ways. You, carry on. Be strong, always question, and find your truth from seeing through your own comprehension. The Arabic thing, yeah. Some preacher dude famously brought that up and my dad had me watch with the family during the times of Ramadan. A lot of language is most definitely lost in translation. Like when you translate chinese to english and it turns out gigantor ton fucked. It’s shit, but it’s true. You’d need to know Arabic for truer meanings to text orr a calm person that understands arabic in order for them to convert the meanings over to you so that you get a better grip.

Anyways, real props to you for questioning all the bullshit that’s been going on in the world. I really hope you find your place, fellow reddit guy. Hope this was somewhat of a helpful understanding."
5,fcibmrd,"&gt; Factually not true at all. Christianity has had its fair share of terrorists. Right wing extremists killed more people in the US than Islamic terrorists in the past decade.

If you look at the statistics at a per capita level Islamic extremist is much higher though.. given how small the Islamic community is in the US."
6,f9i12ms,Tbh it’s the same generalization as with how misrepresented the Islamic community is. They’re not all terrorists like the media would have us believing
7,f2yzzzz,"Look, this can go into a very deep conversation. 

But I don’t believe in the stereotypes, but they do exist for a reason. They wouldn’t exist if we as a society didn’t see a repetitive behaviors or similar descriptive characteristics. 

I don’t think that all black folks are dangerous. I don’t think that immigrants are rapist. I don’t think that muslim folks are terrorist. But people through out the US do, because society keeps repeating that. I know that I repeated right now and it sounds hypocritical, but I was stating that from this point of view. I hope that makes sense. 

I don’t repeat stereotypes and will dismantle them when talking to folks. 

But it was reddit and that’s what first came to mind. That’s all."
8,ercpxh9,"&gt;99% of people aren't mad or scared of Daesh conducting a massive terrorist bombing campaign in the UK.
&gt;

Didnt say they were

&gt;Most UK people, thankfully, like gay folk, and standfast the numpties, at worst, are ambivalent to trans folk and certainly don't want them to be killed. 
&gt;

I disagree. Cite sources for that claim. We've been fighting for our rights for generations and it hasn't been the Muslims we've had to fight against. 

&gt;Most UK people do not think that not being religious is a crime, are not massively misogynistic, don't belive in child marriage and don't think marital rape should get a pass.

Nor do most Muslims. I should know, I married in to a Muslim family. 

&gt;I don't know what meme you are referencing, as I am not 14 years old, but the idea that core islamic values are not contrary to our modern British society's beliefs, isn't a dangerous anything.

A meme is an idea that spreads. You don't need to be 14 to know what that is, just use a dictionary. It was first coined by Richard Dawkins iirc. 

&gt;Why shouldn't a tolerant society be worried about a group of inherently intolerant peope?

You are begging the question twice. Our society is not inherently tolerant and nor are Muslims inherently intolerant. Rather, tolerance is very diverse and more linked to the attitudes of authority figures, peers and parents. My Muslim family is just fine with my Lesbian mother and my lesbian sister, for example whereas my mother's own uncle isn't ok with it.

And here's the real kicker. The right wing usage of gay rights as a stick to beat Muslims with is the most obvious thing in the world. We have been fighting right wing politics for gay rights for generations. Centuries even. To pretend like you're now on our side all of a sudden is beyond insulting. You think it was Muslims quoting leviticus? You think it was Muslims that made homosexuality illegal in the uk? You think it was Muslims who were dragging gay men out in the street and beating them? No, it was folk like yourself.

So until I see you at pride, covered in glitter and singing to show tunes, you can shut your fucking mouth about gay rights. How dare you co opt our struggle for recognition and try to turn it in to a weapon of hate. How fucking dare you."
9,eofpy50,"I preface this by saying I'm an american who wants to live in the UK soon. So I'm by all means fairly ignorant on finer details. But here's my take:

Everyone's worried about acid attacks my dude. That was a thing and it left social scars. You'll have to forgive a bit of paranoia. Again, it only takes one acid attack to make everyone doing this a potential terrorist, forever scaring their records for a meme. That's a terrible thing. Almost as bad as banishing someone far right even if they've changed. People change and should have the liberty to reinvent themselves. As far as I can tell, [Tommy's around a multicultural group these days](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/17/tommy-robinson-election-tour-flags-fights-milkshake-far-right), while most of his attacks seem to be fairly uniform in their appearance: angry white intelligentsia, or angry Pakistani Islamic men. To me it sounds like he's just Islamophobic, and Islam isn't a race so I don't see anything wrong with criticizing it. Religion should be criticized, and archaic beliefs scrutinized. Saying there's a problem with rape in the Islamic community is no more racist than saying there's a problem with pedophilia in the Catholic community.

Now I have no interest in defending someone who I know little about. I'm just an American observer, and that's what I've observed. I don't see any lynchings from Tommy, nor do I see any cars being rid into protesters, nor gunmen slaughtering black churches. Rather I see a multicultural group of people who are concerned with the free pass Islamic men are getting, and Islamic men being angry that they're being singled out, and the occasional angry white intelligentsia looking for a scapegoat. I am ok admitting I might be wrong on this, because I am not well informed. But this is what it looks like to me."
10,ejjay29,"Islam = terrorist is an extremely ignorant and single variriable analysis. To deny Islam is part of the problem is equally as absurd - the problem of radicalization is one that must be coherently addressed both within and outside of the Islamic community. 

The ""fear Islam"" notion is playing into the terroristic far right and only helps breed terrorism. We cannot eradicate Islam in the west. And even if we managed to, we would sacrifice the freedom that western civilisation is built on. That's the goal of the far right, 

 In order to strongly address terrorism, we first need to create an environment where the Islamic community is integrated enough to work with us to eradicate the problem as opposed to against us. "
11,ehshq03,"&gt; Your anecdotal experience of tolerance at university is good to hear, but I am not glibly tarring people with a brush without evidence..

Well you kinda are. When you imply that all Muslims are a certain way, you are unjustly and incorrectly tarring those that aren't. That's not only unfair to those individuals, but also perpetuates the wrong belief. Do we really want to be in a situation where those Muslims who are behaving in the ways that we want them to, feel punished and victimised by the false assumptions we make about them? The ethics of that aside for a second, that's just not incentivising the right things to achieve our goals.

Yes. Lots of Muslims are homophobic and that's a problem that we obviously shouldn't just ignore. But we need to address it with nuance. Sweeping false statements are not the answer. ""There's a big problem with homophobia in the Islamic community."" is a statement I'm 100% on-board with. ""Muslims are backwards and homophobic."" isn't.

&gt; If you try mocking Islam then you will likely have someone so utterly caught up in his own beliefs come and kill you. Life of Brian caused a stir but it had nothing on the Satanic Verses. Isn't that ridiculous?

Ridiculous? Yes. Religious violence is ridiculous. Actually pretty much all violence is ridiculous. As an atheist myself, I would say that all religion is pretty ridiculous too. I can't get on-board with anything that means believing that supernatural things are natural, or that determines actions in the real world based on fiction.

But, again, you are equating your monolithic idea of Islam with individual Muslims. While the religions are not structurally identical and it's not a perfect comparison, that's a bit like justifying comments about all Christians by pointing to the various monstrosities of the Catholic church. We cannot be defining all Muslims by the actions of the extremes. ""Muslims are Islamic-terrorists"" is not a corollary of ""Islamic-terrorists are Muslims"" any more than ""Men are murderers"" is a corollary of ""Most murders are committed by men"".

Finally, while yes Islamic-homophobia rates are wayyyyy too high, let's not pretend that liberal Muslims are some almost-unheard-of rarity or so few in number as to be a rounding-error not worth acknowledging in broad statements. The Mayor of London is a practising Muslim. Here's his tweet from the last Pride parade. https://twitter.com/sadiqkhan/status/1015589984961728513"
12,ehw4npq,"Men find people who commit these acts just as reprehensible as the women do. Most men don't commit anything close to these kind of crimes so why should they be judged on the actions of a few deranged individuals?

Do you say all Muslims are terrorists because someone else claiming to be a Islamic 'martyr' blows up a building? Do you say all Somalian teens are dangerous violent criminals because there are some gangs in Melbourne? Do you say all women are lairs because some loons lie about rape? No, of course not, and anyone on the receiving end of that who hasn't done anything to warrant suspicion should be offended. So why should males who have done nothing of the sort be ok with being lumped into the same category as some of the vilest humans we have?

Is it ok to ask what factors are influencing certain men to these acts, certainly. It's not ok to say ""men"" as a whole are responsible, which is what the current movement tends to do.

If you agree that all the Islamic community is not doing anything to stop terrorist attacks, the Somali community is not doing anything to stop teen gangs, feminist community is not doing enough to stop false rape, maybe men will agree to also be held responsible for the acts of other men they have no control over."
13,egfzafu,"&gt;Australia is at stage now where this isn’t the first case of this happening

So you should be able to answer my original question of ""just how many of these 'sick fucks' are coming into Australia?"", right? Don't forget, people who commit crimes aren't *born* criminals. If someone comes here seeking asylum and commits a crime 10 years later, is that reason to prevent future asylum seekers from coming here?

&gt;we have been a target of terrorism

There have been 7 terrorist attacks since 2014 (I don't count the sydney siege as a terrorist attack, as it's widely acknowledged man monis was a repeat criminal facing a long time in prison). All of these attacks have been limited to shootings/stabbings, with very few victims.

Furthermore, all of these terrorists were radicalised *in* Australia, either online or at mosques/islamic retreats. Stopping asylum seekers from coming to Australia would do sweet FA in combatting that, and any expert on the matter would tell you that engaging the Islamic community is a far more effective way of preventing terrorist attacks.

&gt;using Europe as an example we are on a very slippery slope if we continue down this path, our roads and public transport cannot cope, our unemployment rates are rising, I simply do not want to think about what life is going to be like in 10 years.

We take more people through immigration than we ever will with refugees. We also have no land border for hordes of refugees to flock across, like what happened in Europe with the syrian refugees. It simply isn't likely to occur in Australia, so whilst there are merits in using them as a basis for discussion, they can't be directly compared to our situation.

&gt;My comments and anger stem from a larger issue, this incident was the tipping point

What's the larger issue, then? I'm honestly happy to have a discussion with you, because it really does seem like you're angry, but I have a feeling you may be mistaken or ill-informed in your beliefs. If you're happy to have an honest, fair conversation (so no insults, no taking things on a tangent, no strawmanning or anything and keeping everything based on actual evidence) lets see where this goes.


&gt;I would challenge anyone to explain why it’s Ok for Australia in its current state to continue to let people in.


Sure, here:

1) We're a signatory to the [UNHCR Refugee Convention] (https://www.unhcr.org/1951-refugee-convention.html) and therefore have an obligation to take in and look after people seeking asylum. We literally promised to help people, and we should keep that promise.

2) It's the humane thing to do. Refugees are literally fleeing for their own safety. We're an established, safe, first world country and are *able* to help out. Sure, we can't take as many as the USA could, but we can do our part.

3) I have no issue with vetting refugee's claims, this would be the logical thing to do as you are correct in that we shouldn't let literally anyone in with no checks. We shouldn't be detaining them offshore in inhumane conditions though.


4) Re-settling refugees and helping them acclimate to our society can have a benefit to our society, and can potentially assist in combatting terrorism. I briefly mentioned earlier that the best way to stop terrorists and radicalisation is to *engage* with their community, so helping them get a better life here is a good step in that direction. What doesn't help is when we engage in actions like the 2003 Iraq war, that just pisses people off and radicalises people further (and is one of the main reasons we're in this whole global terrorism boat at the moment)."
14,e8f2ziy,Season 4 of 24 is also the season with the plotline where the nice muslim family is secretly a terrorist cell. The whole season is like a witch or something turned an Iraq war era right wing talk radio into a action show
15,e6b1qvq,"&gt; but the context is, if the Islamic community is going to hide terrorists

What? No it isn’t! You just made that up, you liar. 

&gt; possibly 1000s of groomers

So *possibly* thousands, out of how many? 

&gt; because Islam is not a race.

Yawn. This shitty argument is tired and overused. 

&gt; just going to ignore the bit about Israel then?

I don’t give a shit about Naz Shah, fuck her, yes she’s probably an antisemite. I don’t know why you’re bringing her up in a discussion about racist Tommy Robinson. It feels like you’re trying to change the subject (again)

&gt; Swept under the carpet, why?

Because the police are scumbags when it comes to dealing with rape? This is nothing new, they’ve always been like this. 

Again, you’re changing the subject because you don’t want to admit that Tommy Robinson is a racist (or a *bigot* if that helps you get over the pathetic “Islam isn’t a race argument”)

16,e5zw5nu,"The dumb-asses that insult/generally act like all Muslim individuals are terrorists. It doesn't make me uneasy in traditional sense - it pisses me off. The treatment of those people kinda gave off Nazi-like vibes.

I was a kid (around 4-5th grade) when 9/11/2001 happened and saw a lot of people treat some of my mom's co-workers bad at work after that because they were either Muslim or Indian (a lot of those people confused the two different groups for both being Muslim). It generally sucked, and store management did nothing to stop it for around a year and a half. I think I got to hate it more because I went to work with my mom whenever it was a weekend, a random school-day off, and/or a holiday - it was a thing that happened, at least once a day, for even single time I went there for a year and a half.

Some even went as far as to blame all Muslim people for 9/11 and calling them all terrorists. I honestly had to wonder WTF management was doing and why these people weren't kicked out."
17,e68vc6h,"&gt; Because he literally says that the whole Islamic community will feel the full force of the EDL

He does, but the context is, if the Islamic community is going to hide terrorists, you're as bad as what they are...even so, it's not racist...so your point is moot.

A few terrorists....let's look at the rape gangs...since it can be transferred to this too, 100's, possibly 1000s of groomers, rapists, and not one person from that community came forward? Why do you think that is?

&gt; How is that not racist too?

Dictionary - prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.

because Islam is not a race.

&gt; spineless left winger who is too scared stand up to right wing dregs.

just going to ignore the bit about Israel then?

Also....regarding Rochdale...

Attempts by Rochdale Crisis Intervention Team co-ordinator for the NHS, Sara Rowbotham to alert police and authorities to ""patterns of sexual abuse"" were ignored. Between 2003 and 2014, Sara Rowbothan, made more than 180 attempts to alert police and social services.

Swept under the carpet, why?

18,e1z1skj,"I don't think mass bombing densely populated cities is anything worth praising. And yeah, he took tens of thousands of troops out of harms way...by mass murdering hundreds of thousands of civilians with bombs! In order to protect ourselves from an enemy who kills 1/4th Americans on US soil per year as armed tots and lawnmowers combined!!! All  while denying any culpability, under  the notion that any innocent man woman or child killed by US munitions is somehow a human shield getting blown up on their own accord or being forced by terrorists to stay in targeted areas... so either way... Not our fault. Right? What do you call killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people with bombs? Self defense? I would call it mass murder. If it was domestic terrorism, and we killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Americans with bombs... I highly doubt you would be praising Obama for his ""Noble' efforts to combat terrorism domestically. He would be executed if he killed 1/100th as many Americans with bombs under the guise of self defense. But since they're brown and live very far away, you just don't seem to give a fuck if an innocent Muslim family is murdered in their own home, because either terrorists gave us bad Intel, or we didn't bother to check who we were bombing. You just can't see the bigger picture. We're providing military assistance to 73% of the worlds dictatorships. You would probably argue that providing military aid to dictatorships like Saudi Arabia or Egypt are exceptions to the rule... That it's necessary in order to serve a broader, pro-democratic endgame. But you can't promote and protect democracy by protecting and promoting the majority of the worlds dictatorships at the same time. And if you had an ounce of common sense, you'd realize that. "
19,e11h16i,ok first there is no 2 billion there is mearly 100 million sunni who practice the problem is that you think every one who was born in a Muslim family is muslim its not if you dont follow islam you are not muslim for christian its different no one count them as christian which would make the number even smaller terrorism is a reaction to usa politics no matter from which country or religion you are see Ukraine for example ther is armed conflicts no one is calling EU backed rebels terrorist the same go for pkk un Turkey 
20,dubxi9a,"&gt;i've also noticed that when a muslim commits an act of terror the islamic community is treated very differently in the media than whites get treated when a white person or a white nationalist (which would be the equivalent of a muslim, since it's an ideology) commits an act of terror.
&gt;
&gt;why do you suppose that is?

I suspect it would probably be a different story in a country that isn't majority white, a minority like Muslims can be demonised whereas the majority can't unless the media wants to upset the majority of its viewership.

Hence why white terrorists are often painted as ""mentally ill lone wolves"", I also think the media puts on kid gloves when dealing with a white supremacist terrorist because recently any criticism of the far right is twisted round to mean ""all conservatives are Nazis"" by certain people."
21,dp8dp74,"Are all Muslims terrorists? No. But these are Islamic terrorists. In the same way that catholics harbor pedophiles and have to be held accountable for that. If the Islamic community is doing anything less than a full out attempt to purge these people from their ranks, if there's even a remote amount of tolerance, they have to own it.


"
22,doqruc0,"&gt; The fact is that 99.99% of Muslims in Canada aren't committing these crimes. 

You made up that statistic. If you are going to make an argument, do not invent statistics to support your position. That is asinine and counter productive.

-----------

There are so many issues here that it is hard to know where to start. I will try to be brief with three points:

- What is sufficient for criminal behaviour? There was an entire mosque in Canada which was chanting for the death of the Jews and Christians.\* There were hundreds of Islamic families who raised Canadians to go and fight for ISIS.* I could go on and on; do these people pass the mark?

[source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13WTFjcZWes)

[source](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/terrorism-threat-report-1.3735434)

- What is the psychology of an Islamic fundamentalist? People in general tend to orient themselves towards a team or tribal mindset, psychologically speaking, and as such, it is very easy for an Islamic person to identify with Islamic terrorist organisations, and millions all over the world do. Thus, beyond the already large number of Islamic people who state their sympathies openly, there are many more who say it only behind closed doors due to the fact that they understand the threat of coming out and openly declaring support.

- What is the goal of Islam? To convert the world by the most effective means with very little restrictions; what will that culminate into long term in Canada if they continue to become a larger portion of our population?

My biggest gripe with the Islamic community is that they do not do enough to fight terrorism, and they do not take responsibility for the fact that their religion is the most problematic religion in the world today. 

What do you think?
"
23,dmuyp4v,"you said the prevalent view among the Islamic community is that the Holocaust should have happened. Then you give me an article that shows that Hamas a terrorist group advocate for the killing of all jews. Since when are a HAMAS a small geurilla group confined to a piece of land smaller than new york indicative of how all 1.6 billion muslims think? Everyone knows Hamas wants to murder all the jews in israel No one's disputing that. But most mosques around the world do not teach what hamas teach. your not full of lies just misinformed, and frankly kind of stupid. "
24,dma84oh,"You're comment is welcoming. I am a Muslim woman. I have been lurking on this sub for quite some time and have always noticed it was a proudly Islamophobic sub. It is infested with sanghis and militant atheists. They speak no evil of any other religions. Even news articles and controversies involving other religions are never posted. Take for example, the killings at Kodinhi where a Muslim convert was hacked to death by his sanghi relatives. But any news depicting Muslims in a negative light is upvoted and has many comments.

Anyways, I am not surprised by this. Having lived in Kerala for the past few years, I noticed the deliberate anti Muslim bias of the media. Muslim issues are doubled up and played again and again. Just few years ago, there was this case of some dogs getting killed somewhere in Malabar. Next day, the media called it terrorist training and they were practicing on dogs. I mean what non sense was that. In many panchayats, dogs were killed due to the stray dog menace. This was done by the authorities and there weren't any ulterior motives. But hey, lets just call all Muslims terrorists. 

Another incident was last year. A couple from Kasargod had moved to Iran in search of better pastures. Next day, media spins it as 'they have gone to join ISIS'. Anyone with some basic knowledge of politics and geopolitics would know that nobody wanting to join ISIS would go to Iran. It is a country at the forefront of defeating ISIS and totally Shia, something ISIS abhors. But hey, the media conveniently twisted it to suit their agenda.And not just the sanghi media, even the ""leftist"" ones. Thankfully, it was Media One that exposed that stupidity. And I guess thats the reason why a lot many hate Media One. Kerala Media was always in the hands of RC Christians and Nairs. Media One allows the Muslim to present his point of view and negate the blatant bias of other outlets.  

https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/isil-in-kerala-a-manufactured-threat-1.40182     

Apparently, Muslims shouldn't even talk about justice. Even that is a crime. And lets not talk about NIA. Its main task right now is to see that Hindu women do not marry Muslim men. Hindu women marrying Muslim men is ""love jihad"" while Hindu men marrying Muslim woman is ""secularism"". Welcome to progressive Kerala. This line of thinking is not an isolated case. Just have a look at your movies. They potray Muslim woman as some kind of subservient creatures waiting for Hindu men to come and free them. Lal Jose is infamous for this line of thinking. Every movie of his has to have this theme. Also, the last few years, they have objectified Muslim women. Starting with Thattathin Maryathu. In that movie, all of a sudden the Hindu family is all welcoming while the Muslim family is regressive. This inspite of the fact in Kerala, inter caste marriages are quite low. Nairs rarely marry Ezhavas and Dalits. A collegemate's dad did not allow her to marry her boyfriend who was a Ezhava. And her Dad was an army man. But hey, that's not important for them. Running the misogynist Muslim theme is more important. This inspite of the fact that higher education enrollment is quite high among Muslim women in Kerala.

Muslim women are increasing their participation in the workforce. But what bothers the sanghis and militant atheists is that this hasn't come at the expense of religion. From their point of view, Muslims should have to give up their religion if they want to be part of society while the rest can keep it and strut it. 

Kerala is no bastion of secularism and tolerance. It has the highest number of RSS shakhas. Apparently, that is fine. But a Muslim opening a religious school is a crime. This hypocrisy is something I have noticed time and again. And the more I see it I realise why Muslims need to organise themselves. They seem to be divided on the basis of simple theological differences. Things are only going to get worse from here. There is rampant Islamophobia along with brazen intolerance.

As a Muslim woman, I am happy SDPI exists. It is a mandatory antidote to RSS. As long as they and their brand of Hindutva exists, SDPI is indeed needed. Any Muslim woman who has doubts on that, just read through reports on riot cases in North India. In every anti Muslim pogrom, women are specifically targeted. The Hindutva brigade looks at Muslim women as cattle that needs to be disrobed and dishonoured to show power. If you watch some of the ""new generation"" movies, they too promote it in a subtle manner.

All in all, last few years have made me more aware of my Muslim identity, something that seems to be threatened. I have become more religious. And I sport a hijab at all times. I come from a liberal family where none of the women used to wear hijabs. But gradually things are changing and am happy for it.  "
25,dlue83j,"&gt;Wait what? No, its not the same.

I didn't say the same, I said *rhetorically* and* ideologically* **similar**.

&gt;2 Countries at war is something different than 2 people in a country with different opinions.

Missing the nuance here. I'll elaborate, the United States, and several other countries, opposed the Nazi regime for a number of reasons, **one of which** being the diametrically opposing ideology that the Nazis practiced/exercised. To the rest of, most of, the world the Nazis and their ideas were evil, which is where the parallel is drawn with the Alt-Right of today. Countries fight each other because of differing ideas/opinions, just like people.

&gt;Does that also mean i can punch communist in the face if i am myself a capitalist? Forgot the cold war already?

No, hence as I stated in my previous comment that violently assaulting people with opposing opinions is not (usually) the answer. Unless people violently act upon their beliefs/opinions, force (usually) is not mandated.

&gt;But that would also mean i am free to punch communists or muslims in the face.

No it doesn't, there is nothing *inherently* violent or oppressive about communists/communism, and if you believe so you should head over to /r/communism101 or /r/debatecommunism. As for Muslims, it depends, the Islamic belief is far and wide a striated one with people that vary from one extreme to the next. There are those that value acceptance and virtue whereas others, specifically ISIS, refuse to accept any beliefs accept their own, and violently oppose anyone who would say otherwise.

&gt;There is no war, there is not even a civil war, but if you keep going like this you will have a war.

There is *literally* nothing wrong with (peacefully) protesting an ideology that would do more harm than good, if anything the lack of protest would be the nail in the coffin.

&gt;I mean you are so deep in your Ideologie that you aren't even able to see whats wrong about your view. 

No, it just seems that my ""ideology"" isn't clear enough to you.

&gt;Whats your actuall justification to just punch people in the face you don't like?

I don't know where you're getting this from, where have I advocated for violence except where it's absolutely necessary?

&gt; Can i just label everyone a nazi and punch them?

Of course not.

&gt;Who decides who is a nazi? 

There's very clear definitions of what defines a Nazi, I'm sure you know exactly what one is or *at least* what one is like.

&gt;Of course its justified because america was at war with a national socialist country 80 years ago.

That was an example used for an analogy, not ""justification"".

&gt;Where? In germany...

And that's where things need to be ironed out. I'm not speaking about what happening in Germany, I don't live there, I can't provide you with first hand information about what's going on there. I'm speaking purely as an American, currently living in America, talking about events happening in America. It's very much possible that the neo Nazis/alt-right and antifa in Germany are just as bad as each other, however, in America that is **not** the case.

&gt;Again, am i allowed to punch muslims now? They do even more murder and terrorist acts than nazis, so what is your takeaway from this?

Assuming that they're actually extremists, you know, the people that actually commit these heinous deeds, then sure, punch away. As I said before there's more to Muslims than violence, MOST of the Islamic community is non-violent, it's the few but very flamboyant extremists that give everyone, within the Muslim community, a bad name, same thing with Christians, however the stereotype within the Christian community isn't nearly as bad.

&gt;But thats bullshit again, isn't it? 

No these are all in film, check youtube if you're curious.

&gt;I don't even know the exact circumstances there

White Supremacist, Neo-Nazi, Alt-Right, KKK, etc. sympathizer drove full throttle into a crowd of **peaceful** counter-protesters and killed a 32 y/o woman.

&gt;I am in the hospital right now

I hope you recover soon.

&gt;What was true?

This: Did the guy just start to drive into a group of people and tried to kill as many as he could?

&gt;Or was it the other version that antifa started to attack cars, and then the woman got caught betwen 2 cars and died?

No, I haven't even heard of that version of the story until you said it.

Here's two videos of the crash in action, shot from different angles:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFR-iHmTWVo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeB2ZaUSa48

&gt;And do you think i would be a nazi if i believe this when the later was true?

Of course not.

Oh, here's the exact quote from the KKK after the incident

&gt;""""Nothing makes us more proud at the KKK than we see white patriots such as James Fields Jr., age 20, taking his car and running over nine communist anti-fascist, killing one [expletive] lover named Heather Heyer,"" Moore said in the voicemail. ""James Fields hail victory. It's men like you that have made the great white race strong and will be strong again."""
26,dlzy5p8,"Thats the majority of your friends dipshit. Thats the culture dude they throw gays off buildings in Saudi Arabia. My muslim family is the most mild mannered muslims ive ever met and she is still STRONGLY against homosexuality and boycotted the wedding of my lesbian cousin. So no she does not condone killing gays. If anything the over whelming minority of Trump supporters are nazis and that is the image shown. When a car plowed into a crowd of people here it was framed as a ""white supremacist kills peaceful protesters"" and immediately after when a muslim killed a shitload of people in spain it was called a ""truck attack"". Not a muslim terrorist because they have to maintain the image that Islam is a ""religion of peace"" and that Trump supporters are violent nazis."
27,djtru28,"&gt; just one more woman who chose the wrong stalker man to get involved with like millions of others.

Are you actually blaming the victim for this? Jfc...

Also, if you really care about logic, here's a logical conclusion: Police officers are unique group of individuals, not an element to be copied and pasted. Assuming one officers guilt because of previous stories is no different than assuming a terrorist attack you just heard about was carried out by a Muslim. Individuals are just that not every case is exactly the same. 

I don't think I'm gullible or an idiot for not assuming the cop simply shot that man because he wanted to. I'm just waiting to hear the full story, which you also do not know."
28,djy5wcd,"&gt;I was willing to agree with you up until this point. I find that blaming the U.S for radicals coming over and killing us, is a very disgusting sentiment

Don't you think the US is a little responsible for creating terrorism? Who funded al-qeada and taliban?

&gt; I agree that the war in the Middle-East is wasteful and has contributed to radicalism

 i agree here.

&gt;The radicals that follow the Quran only care about destroying the west since they are seen as infidels (disbelievers), and must be killed. That is what ISIS believes and that is why America has had terrorist attacks before we were involved in a war there.

If the Quran dictates to kill infidels. Then why haven't muslims been mass murdering every other religious folks? The Islamic community is the only one i can come up with that actually allowed you to be a Christian or Jew in their lands in the past 1400years. That's why there are still Christian communities in many islamic countries.

&gt;that is why America has had terrorist attacks before we were involved in a war there.

The US might not have been involved directly by putting troops in foreign countries but they did overthrown many democratically elected governments and replace them with dictators with  the help of the CIA.
"
29,difv5hl,"&gt;I have nothing to hide 

Alright then, hand over all your usernames and passwords so we can look through your bank statements and personal messages. We can't be sure you're not a terrorist after all.

On a serious note, adding backdoors or banning encryption is an **incredibly** stupid idea that will enable criminals to take advantage of those loopholes and make the general public *less* safe. The ""I have nothing to hide"" attitude is dangerous as it sets up an idea that anyone who opposes does have something to hide which is just not true.

&gt;My opinion is that a spokeperson for the Islamic community is required who publicly condemns these attacks

This already takes place. It shouldn't need to though. We never asked the same of the Catholic church when the IRA bombed Brighton or Manchester. People didn't demand the Pope issue a condemnation. Also, despite various Imam's speaking out against these attacks, many Muslims are still subjected to prejudice and abuse.

&gt;Work needs to be done on monitoring young people and stopping them taking on an extreme ideology

I think that funding work aimed at youth and lifting people out of the poverty stricken environments would do a lot more than closely monitoring anyone because they're a young person. It's not just young people who hold these abhorrent views.


I don't have any solid answers for any of this. I think that identifying potential attackers and engaging with them is definitely the right thing to do but once they have started the setup for an attack then they've commited a crime and should be held accountable. Right up to that point, it needs to be some sort of engagement. Potentially have someone sectioned or commited to a dedicated mental health facility for the brainwashing to be undone. More important is identifying and addressing the root cause of the resentment that leads a person to go on a suicide mission for Allah."
30,dig3bir,"I have to agree with you that the reasonable explanation is that this ones could not get guns, and it seems to be because they were not smart enough to overcome the restrictions in England.

OTOH, in France, where the Islamic community is way larger, they did get AK47's for the attacks.  

I believe is not worth it, to deprive *all* law abiding citizens from a mean of self-defense, just because *some* terrorists are too stupid/lack support/connections.

In reference to gun accidents, I guess I agree with you that mandatory training is required, something like a driver's license."
31,di0gte4,"I mean, what do you expect them to do? 

It's become clear that the Islamic community is the primary source of terrorist attacks. Shouldn't that be considered?

Perhaps some of their rights need to be taken away. Their right to religious expression doesn't extend to the point that they can take lives (or plan to take lives) with impunity. Everyone has a right to life.

edit: Downvote all you like, but I bet none of the people who downvoted haven't been near a terrorist attack, or have had their family near a terrorist attack, like I have.

For context:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Fresno_shootings - I was in the area when this happened, heard the gunshots. That son of a bitch was targetting white people, and he would have shot me too if he had seen me.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack - Grandparents were eating lunch a block away from the shooting when it occurred, police locked down the nearby buildings.

So if you're apologizing for these animals, or defending their religious convictions, go absolutely fuck yourself."
32,di1nobw,"They're not actually. The terrorists tend to be bitter reactionary dumbasses who think their cause has far more support than it really does, the other side is far weaker and stupider than it really is, and that all it'll take to bring the west to its knees and/or spark a mass popular uprising among the islamic community is a few half-assed terror attacks. They're not playing a long game of radicalising the islamic community by provoking radicalised white conservatives into attacking it, because they're fucking idiots who think society's already almost at the tipping point. 

Like seriously, we're talking some straight up Four Lions bullshit here, not three-dimensional chessmasters :)"
33,fbyvp8r,"You provided an anecdote. 

If you look at the actual statistics, at least for the US, on a per capita basis brown Muslim folks are multitudes more likely to engage in terrorism than white right wing folks. Theyve got a roughly similar body count despite the latter accounting for like 40% of the population and the former accounting for only 1% of the population. 

And you're still more likely to die falling out of your bed than be killed by either one of them."
34,fdpyrsz,"Actually thatd be brown Muslim men. Since 9/12/01 its actually been pretty 50/50 in terms of number of incidents and death toll for whites and muslims when it comes to domestic terrorism in the US. 

The ""disproportionate"" bit kicks in when you realize that whites are like 60% of the population and Muslims are like 1%. So on a per capita basis brown Muslim folks are multitudes more likely to engage in domestic terrorism than whites. 

FWR: *screeching excuses*"
35,er3qs99,"this used to frustrate me so much but i am just numb to it now. 

the very people who are so hard on islam, and muslim individuals, are in such deep denial of the christian terrorism, fundamentalism, rigid scripturism, and general appeal to oppression that is again taking the world over."
36,e8ptwnz,"&gt; I don’t think modern day Christians are less judgy than modern day Muslims. In some parts of the world, yes, of course, but all of the Muslims I know personally are great people

Well, now we're talking anecdotal evidence, since my experience is exactly the opposite.

&gt;and I don’t think it’s fair to criticize their religion more than others

If it earned that criticism, then it's fair. Saying ""you can't criticize ideology X without criticizing Y first"" is pure whataboutism and serves only to derail the conversation.

&gt;The extremists stand out but they do as well in Christianity.

Expect in Islam you have countries ruled by those extremists. Show me the Christian equivalent of Saudi Arabia in modern world.

&gt;Your typical Muslim family is not going to show up on the news so what you hear about is the extremes (let’s not forget it has the largest following of any world religion). How people act depends on the culture they are living in and grew up with.

No, they won't commit acts of terrorism, but they still will be way more conservative than your typical Christian family.

---

However, let's even say that you're right and Christianity is as bad as Islam. Does that automatically make Islam okay?

And if not, then why are we even arguing that?"
37,e4te4fy,"A: Christians generally don't do this. When some dude attacks an abortion clinic even the hardcore pro-life folks will try to both claim they had nothing to do with it, but also quietly praise him.

And plenty of Christians claim that ills done by another Christian are just ""personal issues"" and have nothing to do with their shared culture.

B: all the damn time, when Muslims do speak out against terrorism, anti-Muslim people just ignore it. All the time American imams go on the news and condemn attacks, and tons of religious leaders and institutions, including Al Azhar in Egypt which is among the most prominent Islamic universities in the world, have put out fatwas saying that suicide bombing is a sin and will block the killer from paradise.

Anti-Muslim folks are obsessed with taqqiya, the principle that when their life is at risk a Muslim is allowed to lie and pretend not to be Muslim. That's almost entirely a Shia minority thing, and a tiny bit of doctrine (that a lot of Muslims probably have never heard of), rather than some universal plot as alleged. Claiming that all Muslims follow it is like confronting some random Lutheran and demanding they justify the Calvinist doctrine of ""the elect""; personally I was a Protestant for two decades and never once heard of the concept in church."
38,dwi4ci9,"But they're not a minority! Go speak to ordinary muslims and ask about grooming gangs or terrorism. They have absolutely shocking views. Non-muslim women (white, brown, yellow or black) are on the whole seen as fair game and terrorism is seen as a reasonable or if not obvious response to western meddling and terror in muslim countries like Iraq and Afghanistan. I've heard this from friends and colleagues. They might not condone it but I assure you sympathy is hard to find. They have some absolutely nuts views and these are the people who'll have a cheeky vodka, have sex before marriage, maybe even smash a bacon butty - they're not even particularly religious. 

I've got along with Muslims my whole life and will continue to get along with individuals. But the idea getting along with them and looking over the huge cultural clash will get us anywhere good is extremely foolish. We've given them an inch, they've took a couple of miles as a collective. The Indian sikhs or afro-Caribbean christians aren't causing these issues

Grooming gangs is a misnomer. These aren't criminal enterprises. They're ordinary muslims coming together to rape non-muslims. They only qualify as gangs in the sense what they're doing is illegal. It's a falsehood that this is all being done by organised crime, a lot of the people being caught are random professionals.  

At the end of the day you're just parroting dogma. If scientologists were doing half of what the Islamic community is doing in this country you'd be calling for the religion to be banned. 

I'm not sure your point about migration from Pakistan and Bangladesh. We didn't have much of it in the 60s and 70s and look at the untold suffering it's caused. Tens of thousands of christian and sikh children raped as a result. That's ok by you?

39,dug6kd6,"Andy.

I am asking you what **concrete steps** can we take to prevent another Aqsa Parvez?

Your ""solutions"" seem to be some combination of:

* kid gloves - Muslims need to be coddled and hopefully one day they'll get around to not forcing their wives to wear cloth bags and will in fact start cheering for our Olympic curling team and start wearing Crosby 87 jerseys, amirite amirite?
* get people to report abuse, somehow - as if Muslim women are not currently reporting abuse and being ignored by a protective and judicial service that is afraid of being branded racist by getting involved in ""domestic"" or ""cultural"" affairs.
* tolerating intolerance - because nothing shows my virtue better than allowing my culture to be replaced by the one that produced the hellhole country that these people are ironically running from.
* love - because love conquers all, heart heart, hug hug, kiss kiss, big hug, little kiss.

I am asking you for **concrete steps.**

Enough with the obscurantism, rainbows, unicorns and butterflies.

**Concrete steps.**

Also, do you have those 2 drawings done yet? Remember? We were going to celebrate our Canadian diversity by counting how many death threats you'd get.

&gt; Women in Iran are fighting against FORCED wearing of their hijabs. People are fighting.

Andy, why are they fighting against the hijab?

Why the hijab?

Why not, say, open-toed sandals?

What's so important about the hijab?

Could it be that it's more than just a piece of fabric?

Could it be that it stands for something, and is part of something bigger?

Could it be that it is part of a system of control that includes honor killings and bans on women being educated or driving? One that holds that women are ritually unclean when menstruating? One where women should remain silent in places of worship and pray separately? One that wants women to resign positions of authority, stop working and stay home? One where females have become a commodity, a possession? One where the honor of the Muslim family is seen to reside in a woman's chastity and modesty? One where women are to be completely covered and excluded from the outside world? One where women, in effect, have become symbols of men's Islamic commitment?

Maybe that's what these brave Iranian women are fighting for?

But somehow, that same piece of fabric over here in the West means something else. It means freedom of choice. Funny how we can go from a hijab being a cogwheel in the Islamic misogyny machinery to...fashion statement, just by a simple change in geography. Amazing.

You said earlier than forcing a woman not to veil is the same as forcing a woman to veil. And I disagreed. Because life isn't always black and white, in fact it almost never is, especially when it comes to ethics and morality. Two wrongs don't make a right...except when it does. 

If it's wrong to physically confine someone against their will, then it's wrong to physically confine someone against their will who has themselves physically confined someone else against their will. But then why do we imprison kidnappers?

I'll tell you what Iranian women are fighting for. They're fighting to get rid of the same Islamic conservatism that is strangling the life out of their society, the same Islamic conservatism that Western liberal societies are celebrating as ""diversity"" and allowing to gain a stronger and stronger foothold. All in the name of tolerance. That's what they're fighting for.

And while that lone, brave Iranian woman is standing at the side of the road, waving her hijab, risking her life and showing more balls than 90% of the Western liberals, she's probably wondering, ""what the fuck is wrong with you liberals? I thought you'd have my back, instead you're calling me an Islamophobe""

Finally, I'll give you some information on myself - I am non-white, born in a 3rd world country and immigrated to Canada sixteen years ago. I have **first hand** experience being the victim of Islamic terrorism and violence. I have personally witnessed what unchecked Islamic fundamentalism does to a country, unlike the hordes of Starbucks-sipping, skinny-jeans-wearing, liberal armchair philosophers who foam at the mouth for social justice and microaggressions on Twitter when they're not attending gender studies classes. And I've seen time and time again that the foot soldiers of radical Islam are not the jihadists and the ultra-conservative Muslims, but the ""ultra-tolerant"", liberal far-left who gleefully clear the way for them to bore into the core of our beautiful culture and values and make a mockery of all it stands for, using our tolerance against us, using our freedoms against us and using our democracy against us. I am not a conspiracy theorist, I am a realist. In the sixteen years that I've been in Canada, I've seen it slowly change for the worse, just like it did in the country I came from. And if you're being honest and can say you haven't noticed, then you haven't been paying attention. There is no Muslim majority country that is a bastion of free-speech, gay rights, women's rights, minority, equality and democracy. None. Not a single one. I once read a quotation from someone that went like this: *In countries where Muslims are a minority, they are obsessed with minority rights. In countries where Muslims are the majority, there are no minority rights.*

I play hockey with two Muslim guys. I play poker with them several times a year. One of them drinks. They are Canadians first. Muslim second. These are the types of Muslims Canada needs. Muslims who assimilate. Migrants who assimilate. We need to encourage those types of people to come here. And what about the Muslims that are already here who have no interest in assimilating and adopting our values? The answer to that question is complex, I certainly don't have all of the answers, but you'll never get to an answer if you refuse to ask the question in the first place."
40,dpjsfo7,"Right... in other countries to cause regime change. Not because Alex Jones wants to sell more drink mix and fear monger. However I'm up for playing that game.

Okay, so as some talking heads have made the claim that the recent mass shootings were false flags (unless of course it's done by a Muslim and then it's instantly terrorism). So we've established that only mass shootings by Non-Muslim individuals are false flags. 

So lets work the problem. In each of the examples you listed above there was a reason for the action, what are the reasons of these recent mass shootings? What would be the end game? It can't be gun control because even after the greatest mass shooting in history we can't even block bump stocks. Yet somehow we are going to enact gun legislation? Yeah, I'll be surprised if we ever enact any common sense legislation. 

Hmm I guess it could be desensitization, or distraction. From what though? All Vegas did was distract Fox News when they couldn't hate someone for it, and this most recent shooting at a church. What the actual fuck? 

Okay so... no real end game so perhaps it's just to cause chaos? &lt;shrug&gt; I honestly don't see a reason for a possible false flag event. 

Secondly, what would it take to make it happen? So they need to first find a shooter, secondly one that is willing to die, and thirdly is willing to work with the government (or ""mystery"" person) to shoot up a bunch of innocent people. They have to keep them strung along for several years, while the person continues to stockpile guns and THEN execute the plan. On top of that, they have to have a 100% success rate because if someone backs out of it at the last minute the game is up. 

Okay, so maybe it's someone they've trained but it has to be someone who so strongly believes in the cause that not only are they willing to die for it, they are willing to kill innocent people, and infants that also happen to be US Citizens. Which goes back to the first question... What exactly is the end game here? I am sure there are some real cold blooded assholes out there, but I'm not even sure that they would be up for a cause where they knowingly are going to kill children AND then commit suicide.

Now... there has to be someone that recruits these people, that also believes in the cause... which really isn't established? Who is not only willing to do so, but also is so good at it they have a 100% success rate in doing so, AND are able to trigger said attacks on specific dates to make it happen. Not only that they will have a support staff as well and all of them will need to keep it quiet. 

Notice how this is kind of starting to fall apart? I think the better explanation is that the mass shootings are not False Flags, and that people like Alex Jones and Sean Hannity are using it as a technique to scare people (because fear sells) and sell product. "
41,dq0ebyy,"It’s nothing to do with skin tone. Arguably the most successful wave of large scale immigration this country has ever seen was “brown people” (to use his term): ie our British Hindu and Sikh communities. They are over represented within the professions and generally affluent.

I have a specific problem with Islam because it is by the most inflexible of the major religions. The Islamic community is very poorly integrated - look at the cultural views evidenced in the British Muslim survey, the overrepresentation amongst perpetrators of terrorism related deaths and the under participation in the workforce. The essential self ghettoisation.

This is why I’m against halal; it’s a slippery slope towards increasing concessions to s politicised religion which is fundamentally at odds with the right to self determine and to broader tolerance. "
42,dmvzno9,"So now we know that when you ban something...it disappears?

I'm failing to understand how this study is interesting enough to warrant attention. If you banned r/anime, I am 100% certain that the names of popular shows would appear less often on Reddit. The true concern is whether this would induce weebs to abandon their degenerate lifestyle or whether they would double-down, fading into the shadows...until one day a Muslim family is found sliced up by a katana.

My view is that the more isolated someone feels, the more likely they will lash out in an attempt to bring attention to themselves. This seems to be the common thread connecting most mass-shootings (a.k.a. ""white terrorism""). Add a symbol to that isolation, and nothing short of its destruction will allow their views to change. Therefore,  banning something may hide it, but doesn't actually weaken it.

And if your bans keep catching innocents up in them, you might end up with an ISIS on your hands."
43,dn5w7hv,"I'm questioning how worthwhile those measures actually are. What do you think that if you just bomb ISIS out of existence, all Islamic terrorism everywhere in the world will instantly stop? No, the state of ISIS is a complete joke, it's all the organisations connected to ISIS who are the real threat.

The government knows that, which is why our strategy is trying to find these organisations and put a stop to them. That's much easier if we have informants in those organisations.

The problem is people like you who think you can solve every problem by nuking everything, not realising that these ""simple solutions"" don't actually solve anything. You guys are the ones really obstructing any worthwhile measures against Islamic terrorism by coming up with such inane, ill thought solutions when we need actual intelligent long term solutions...

We're not going to create peace in the Middle East by nuking it off the face of the planet...

You say ""highlight the problem of Islam"". What does that even mean in terms of solutions. Do you think if the government is like ""Islam does bad stuff"" the Islamic community is going to be like ""ah yes we were a bit silly, we'll stop all this terrorism stuff"". What is the implication of your ""solution""?"
44,dii6m4d,"I've always said that Islam needs to reform itself from within.  It's heartening to know that the Islamic community is taking a stronger stance against any and all acts of terrorism.  We just need the collective global Islamic community to get on board and denounce these acts at every turn.  The more these religious radicals are shunned and opposed, the sooner they will be eradicated.  This is something bombs and soldiers can never fix."
45,dizjfcu,"The root of the problem is that there are always going to be sociopathic people who use impressionable disaffected young men to cause death and destruction. Most religions and ideologies can be used to radicalize, but some are a lot easier than others. There's a reason why Islam has such a huge global problem with terrorism. It's because their prophet used violence, intimidation, and coercion to achieve his goals. You can Westernize and Liberalize Islam as much as you want but there's no escaping this simple fact. 

These young guys being radicalized do not know to hit someone is wrong. They are being taught that hitting an infidel is what god wants them to do. They are taught that violence is the ultimate expression of power and they need to commit violence in order for their tribe to gain supremacy. These aren't normal healthy young men, they are school shooter types, the Middle Eastern versions of Dylan Kleibold and Eric Harris. 

The global Muslim community needs to acknowledge that Islamic terrorism is a Muslim problem, and then start taking steps to curb this problem. This is not something that Westerners are going to be able to stop, it needs to be stopped by Muslims.

Currently the global Islamic community is standing around with their hands in their pockets trying to pretend that this is not a problem with Islam and they have no responsibility to stop it. Until they realize that they need to collectively come up with concrete methods to ideologically fight these radicalizers, the problem is going to continue. 

It doesn't fucking help that Saudi Arabia, one of the most powerful and wealthy Muslim nations in the world, are firm proponents of Wahabism and blatantly fund terrorism with the money they get from their oilfields. "
46,dhjuxjk,"I thought I was the only one who noticed it. 

God-Emperor does NOT say we are at war with Islam, he says we are at war with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM -- a quote in this vein:

&gt;""ISIS also threatens _peaceful Muslims_ across the Middle East, and _peaceful Muslims_ across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality - and _who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety_."" 

*We can continue to _BATTLE ISLAMISM_, and _CHALLENGE ISLAM itself_, without lumping those two groups together.* 

I'm sure most of the rabid anti-Muslim folks are sincere and are simply overreacting to the MSM wanting to pretend that Islam is not a problem. And I'm sure some of them are trying to paint all centipedes with  a broad brush. 

People forget that there is massive ideological diversity among Muslims, depending on the dominant culture in which they find themselves. 

TBH, I think the good, assimilated Muslims are ""doing it wrong"", if doing it right means following Mohammed's example. 

But so fucking what. It doesn't change the fact that plenty of Muslims (esp in the West) are good people and good Americans. 

If nothing else, we should be able to agree that people who refer to themselves as Muslims are individuals, and that some of those individuals are good people."

51,e023lpk,"My friend let's look at some Quran verses:

&gt;But those **who believe and do deeds of righteousness,** We shall soon admit to Gardens, 4:57

 ""Believing"" and doing deeds of ""righteousness."" We'll see what these mean later.

&gt;But those **who believe and work righteousness,\-** no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear,\- **they will be Companions of the Garden,** therein to dwell \(for ever\).  7:42  
&gt;  
&gt;\(After the believers are saved from entering the Fire, they will be kept in wait by a bridge between Paradise and Hellfire. Then, transgression that occurred between them in the life of this world will be judged. Until, when they are **purified and cleansed,** they will be given permission to enter Paradise.* tafsir ibn kathi*r  
&gt;  
&gt;[http://quranx.com/Tafsirs/7.42](http://quranx.com/Tafsirs/7.42)

As you can see righteous, clean, ""purified"" people will be admitted to heaven. Think of it like some kind of ""purification chamber.""

&gt;Gardens of perpetual bliss: they shall enter there, as well as **the righteous among their fathers, their spouses, and their offspring:** and angels shall enter unto them from every gate \(with the salutation\) 13:23  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\(and \(also\) those who acted righteously from among their fathers, and their wives, and their offspring.\) Allah will gather them with their loved ones, from among their fathers, family members and offspring, **those who are righteous and deserve to enter Paradise,** so that their eyes are comforted by seeing th*em. tafsir ibn ka*thir  
&gt;  
&gt;[http://quranx.com/Tafsirs/13.23](http://quranx.com/Tafsirs/13.23)

So, it doesn't matter whether your family are in hell or not. The only people that can enter are ones that are ""righteous"", if they're not, they can't enter. That's the doctrine basically. Now we're approaching to most important verses:

&gt;Thou wilt not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, loving those who resist Allah and His Messenger, **even though they were their fathers or their sons, or their brothers, or their kindred.** For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with a spirit from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow, to dwell therein \(for ever\). Allah will be well pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the Party of Allah. Truly it is the Party of Allah that will achieve Felicity. 58:22  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\(You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred.\) Meaning, do not befriend the deniers, even if they are among the closest relatives. Allah said,  \(Let not the believers take the disbelievers as friends instead of the believers, and whoever does that will never be helped by Allah in any way, except if you indeed fear a danger from them. And Allah warns you against Himself.\) \(3:28\), and,  \(Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allah brings about His decision \(torment\). And Allah guides not the people who are the rebellious.\)\(9:24\)   
&gt;  
&gt;... \(For such He has written faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Ruh from Himself.\) means, **those who have the quality of not befriending those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they are their fathers or brothers, are those whom Allah has decreed faith, meaning, happiness, in their hearts** and made faith dear to their hearts and happiness reside therein.   
&gt;  
&gt; \(Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him.\) contains a beautiful secret. When the **believers became enraged against their relatives and kindred** in Allah's cause, He compensated them by being pleased with them and making them pleased with Him fro**m what He has granted them of eternal delight, ultimate victory and encompassing favo**r*. tafsir ibn kath*ir  
&gt;  
&gt;[http://quranx.com/Tafsirs/58.22](http://quranx.com/Tafsirs/58.22)

Actually it's becoming pretty obvious and clear. Let's look at our final verses:

&gt;Say: **If it be that your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your mates, or your kindred; t**he wealth that ye have gained; the commerce in which ye fear a decline: or the dwellings in which ye delight \- **are dearer to you than Allah, or His Messenger**, or the striving in His cause;\- then wait until Allah brings about His decision: and** Allah guides not the rebellious**. 9:24  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Allah commands shunning the disbelievers, even if they are one's parents or children, and prohibits taking them as supporters if they choose disbelief instead of faith. *ibn kathir*

So if your family are dearer to you than Allah, then you essentially become a rebellious person. Contrast this verse with ""righteousness"" and ""faith"" of the earlier verses. Also:

&gt;Allah hath promised to Believers, men and women, gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein, and beautiful mansions in gardens of everlasting bliss. But the greatest bliss is the good pleasure of Allah: that is the supreme felicity. 9:72

Since surah 9 is the last surah and has the most authority\(2:106\), whatever it says have more authority than the rest of the Quran. 9:72 clearly sets the rule: only the believers will inherit the garden, the jannah. And:

&gt;**It is not fitting,** for the Prophet and **those who believe**, that they should pray for forgiveness for Pagans, **even though they be of kin, after it is clear to them that they are companions of the Fire**. 9:113  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;And Abraham prayed for his father's forgiveness only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to him **that he was an enemy to Allah,** **he dissociated himself from him:** for Abraham was most tender\-hearted, forbearing. 9:114

It is again, very clear. But let me add tafsir of verse 114, it will completely clear the things here:

&gt;\(But when it became clear to him Ibrahimthat he \(his father\) is an enemy of Allah, he dissociated himself from him\) 9:114. Ibn \`Abbas commented, ""Ibrahim kept asking Allah to forgive his father until he died, when he realized that he died as an enemy to Allah, he disassociated himself from him.'' In another narration, he said, ""When his father died he realized that he died as an enemy of Allah.'' Similar was said by Mujahid, Ad\-Dahhak, Qatadah and several others. \`Ubayd bin \`Umayr and Sa\`id bin Jubayr said, ""Ibrahim will disown his father on the Day of Resurrection, but he will meet his father and see dust and fatigue on his face. He will say, \`O Ibrahim! I disobeyed you, but today, I will not disobey you.' Ibrahim will say, \`O Lord! You promised me that You will not disgrace me on the Day they are resurrected. What more disgrace than witnessing my father being disgraced' **He will be told, \`Look behind you,' where he will see a bloody hyena \-\- for his father will have been transformed into that \-\- and it will be dragged from its feet and thrown in the Fire.'''**  
&gt;  
&gt;[http://quranx.com/Tafsirs/9.114](http://quranx.com/Tafsirs/9.114)

There also passages of Quran where Allah says that there is a good example in Abraham and his story. Now I think it's pretty clear but let's add your questions:

&gt; Jannah, it's possible to stay there and kept in the state of utmost bliss with one's will remaining free. Hence you are able to wish a n y t h i n g and be fulfilled.  
&gt;  
&gt;Say, if our parents \(if they stayed a muslim and go to jannah\) wished to see their child \(whom I assumed is now residing with Abu Lahab and co.\), do they get their child? Or will they be given a clone? Or allah will go ""nah he's not going out"" \(although this contradicts the nature of jannah\)? Or will they ""forget"" about us?

To enter jannah, you have to be someone who is a true believer and righteous and purified. If you already have thoughts or love or bonds with your non\-muslim family, Allah won't admit you into his heaven\(as someone who admitted into heaven is someone who cut those ties with non\-muslims, so to speak\). So the idea of ""I'll be in heaven but will have thoughts about my non\-muslim family"" is paradoxical, I think. You may have thoughts and feeling about your kaffir family in the the day of judgment, where each person will be judged. Because as ibn kathir explains, Ibrahim will also see his non\-muslim father, but Allah will turn his father into a bloody hyena and throw him into the fire. That's what will happen to your non\-muslim family and friends. Notice Ibrahim's attitude towards his father: hostile and indifferent. That should be a muslim's outlook towards his non\-muslim parents and friends. That's how Ibrahim will pass the test\(9:114, 60:4\). The muslim will be cleansed, admitted into heaven, and then logically you won't ever have this kind of desire or thought. You will delight yourself with virgins and wines, your family will be tortured and burned for eternity. So two things:

1 \- Since the true believer is someone who shunned/rejected his non\-muslim family and friends, he won't have any kind of desire to bring them to heaven. Think of this believer like someone who is brainwashed/purified.

2 \- Hypothetically even if you do desire this, Allah can't/won't admit your family to heaven. In the judgment day only ""pure"" ""clean"" ""righteous"" people will gain entrance into heaven. Your family failed this. Therefore they went to hell. Admitting an unclean person into a place which have concerns about hygiene\(so to speak\), is a contradiction. If that's the case, there would be no need for believing in Islam or the threat of hell. You'll be a true muslim, your parents won't. Then you'll go to heaven and rescue them from hell. That's illogical and contradictory with whole message of Quran.

But Quran is full of contradictions so I don't know. You can ask, ""but Allah said I can desire ""anything"" I want."" Yeah, he didn't say, ""you can desire anything, but don't ask me to rescue your kaffir parents you son of a bitch."" He said, ""anything you desire."" And since Allah is omnipotent, Allah can do whatever he wants. But also, if Allah admits your parents, he'll be in a contradiction with his messages. And I showed above that Allah already granted permission to family and friends, but only who are ""righteous"", i.e. muslims.

But like I said, Quran, or Islam, is a contradictory religion. You really posed a good question, and I answered using Quran verses, but it may not seem a satisfactory answer for you and I respect that. As ibn kathir regularly says, ""Allah knows best."" LOL

Final note: That's my interpretation of your questions. If there's a clear Islamic doctrine in some hadith or something about what you asked, I'll be happy to correct myself."
52,dwxbvcn,"Well it wasn't funny, it's a tired way of contributing to the impression that the only and most major threat to the Islamic community is Cheeto-Boy, when those who want to hijack Islam or patronize Muslims are doing much more damage."
53,duvsal9,"&gt;And the modern Muslim family is definitely less sexist thé the conservative fundamentalist Christian or Jewish family.

So the overwhelming minority of fundamentalist Christian/Jewish families are more sexist than the overwhelming minority of Islamic families?

This is what u/PraiseTheSuun ~~meant~~ was discussing when she talked about people dragging other religions in.  People only want to discuss outliers, and the Crusades, rather than Islam being, in general, a threat to females everywhere.

54,djjmthu,"&gt; Apostates would be forced to either face the penalty, or come back to Islam.

That's kind of unfair, though, isn't it? I mean, anyone who's born into a Muslim family is automatically considered Muslim, right? So that means that the majority of Muslims aren't even given a choice.

And even if someone who wasn't raised Muslim converts, then later realises they don't actually believe in the religion, why is it a problem for them to leave? Why shouldn't they be allowed to practice what they believe freely? People change their beliefs - if they didn't, they wouldn't have ever become Muslim in the first place.

&gt; he would be either be told to become Muslim or die.

That doesn't make any sense. What that option really is, is ""pretend to be Muslim or die"". You can't force someone to believe in something they don't believe in.

Actually, that goes for apostates too - if someone decides they don't believe in Islam anymore, making them continue to ""be"" Muslim under threat of death or torture or whatever isn't going to actually make them be Muslim.

All of this seems really violent and controlling. As a non-Muslim, it makes me want to never even consider converting to Islam.

Also you didn't answer my question of what should happen to someone who insults Mohammad. Although, the fact that anything should happen to them doesn't really make sense either - he's in Heaven so he obviously doesn't care, and non-Muslims saying Mohammad was a bit belligerent or cruel doesn't ""weaken the religion"" any more than anything else we're ""allowed"" to say about it. Like the stuff I said above. It certainly doesn't put people off it any more than what you claim are its actual tenets.

Although even if it did, I don't think you really have the right to do anything to people to ""defend"" it other than tell them what you feel is the truth. I don't call for Muslims to face any sort of penalty when they insult my beliefs or way of life."
55,di545hv,"Deternment without trial has been done before in wartime.  Churchill interned approx 55,000 enemy aliens in WWII.  Most of these were released before the end of the war as it was quickly released that they posed no threat, been refugees from Nazi Germany etc.  Internment was ended altogether at the end of the war with no lasting effects on the justice system.  

The main objection therefore to this policy appears to be that the Muslim community will be 'triggered' by this.  If the Islamic community is so easily stirred into anger by our society seeking to protect itself from Muslim organisations/people who wish to do us harm, then I would argue that this conflict is inevitable and needs to be settled now, rather than kicking the can down the road and leaving it to tomorrows generation."
56,dh26fkb,"Why is it weird? The Serbs killed any individual that was likely to pick up a gun to fight them (now or eventually) when they killed men and boys. The women were raped and ignored because they were unlikely to form into militias and fight back. 

So it makes complete sense why the Serbs murdered the immediate and medium term threat, but then the question is why didn't they also kill the women for the sake of it. Well, Srebrenica was always meant to be secret. The Serbs told the Dutch that they were evacuating the males as enemy combatants to a pow camp area so they wouldn't return to fighting. Well how would the Serbs have taken the women once they were under the nominal protection of the UN? Could the Serbs say ""guys, let's take these clearly innocent women too - we'll put them in POW camps"" and get away with it? It would've been obvious that there was a genocide going on. It's not like the Dutch were literally watching the mass killings and burials at Srebrenica BTW - the men/boys were loaded onto buses and taken some distance away. They were buried en masse, then moved several times to conceal the massacre further. And it wasn't one event, the massacres and burials occurred in waves - in different locations. 

So the main concern was to eliminate fighting males, and ultimately kill off as many Muslim families as possible (without the patriarch or son to take that role, the Muslim family is severely weakened. A single mother would be easily assimilated into a
Serbian state more so than a full Muslim family - after all, a Muslim Bosnian looks the same as a catholic or orthodox Slav). The issue wasn't ethnicity, it was religion and men who would fight for their region. "
57,dkhvpp9,"Honestly it's really easy for some people to tell you to just leave, I can tell that youre a careful and rational person and you arent just planning to run away. The best thing you can do is wait til you are independent, no one can make you stay especially not youre parents. Once you have a career set out for you, your parents have nothing to threaten you with. Considering the fact that theyre controlling, it's best to lay low for now and continue studying until you have the means to leave. If you made it through all these years, you can definitely hold out for a while longer and be able to take care of yourself. I wish you the best of luck :) the hardest part of being gay from a muslim family is that it is unheard of... DO NOT LOSE HOPE, the world is a cruel place but dont let that sway you in anyway."
58,frv6iug,There is a very good reason the Islamic community is called out and marginalised.  They are a dangerous group that promotes hate and bigotry.  I have no issues with anyone criticising them or any other religion.
59,fbbyio0,"The problem is most of the restrictions on the validity of lesser jihad is nullified by the takfiri ideology. I’m sure you know what I’m referring to, but for those who don’t “takfir” is declaring that other Muslims are infidels (kufar). If you’re educated by takfiris, you can simply ignore all the other Muslims who disagree with you, as they are enemies of Allah. 

Also there are salafi organizations organizations sort of in between. They support the lesser jihad, but only that of the *pen/tongue* and not that of the *sword.* The Muslim Brotherhood is a good example of this. And the Wahhabi version of Islam can get dangerously close to supporting jihad of the sword. Hell, Abd el-Wahhab rose to power through takfir, declaring that the more liberal Islam of the Ottomans wasn’t true Islam, and he teamed up with the Al-Saud dynasty to force the conversion of different tribes into his own more conservative sect, using violence when necessary. 

I totally agree with you that Westerners use “jihad” as a synonym of terror, which is incorrect. However, much terror in the Islamic community is a result of a certain view of lesser jihad. And the rules about lesser jihad are good in theory, but they’ve unfortunately been unable to prevent violence in the name of Allah. In the minds of many Muslims, a holy war is not only possible but righteous and necessary. 

Inshallah there will be reforms to combat this and expanded education will help, but not when the most influential leaders in the Islamic community, like Saudi Arabia, continue to support the wahhabi ideology that has been shown to be a dangerous stepping stone to violent jihad."
60,fbpccj4,"There are over 1.8 BILLION muslims this is 24.1% of the world's population. That is almost a quarter of every person on earth identifies themselves as muslim. This was also the estimate in 2015 so there are bound to be more by now.

If the islamic community is as dangerous as the right winged media would like you to believe we'll definitely be outnumbered. If the islamic faith was that dangerous why are 1 in 4 people identifying as muslim? If we had 1.8 billion enemies we would've been done in loooong ago.

In short: I agree with you a 100%, the extremists assholes are the ones that ruin it for the rest. This would be the same if we saw the entire catholic faith as Jehovah's witnesses which it clearly isn't.

I say this as someone who identifies as agnostic: get the fuck over yourselves people, every culture has assholes I mean most school shooters are white as snow so is every white student now a school shooter? Didn't think so"
61,f4l5h7f,"&gt; And, in some respects, I'd even say that young Muslim folks are more socially progressive than ""old white French secularists"".

I'm a french woman and I sincerely don't understand how you can say this. No, young muslim folks are not "" socially (??) more progressive"". Misoginy is far, far more prevalent than in any other part of the population -  even with ""their"" women, but white-non muslim-girls had enough of the sexual harassment too - and I speak from years and years of sexual street harassment in Paris. My arabic female collegues also have been harassed at work because they eat during the ramadan, and date non-muslim guys. 
Homophobia is, again, very prevalent and totally uninhibited. Only muslims would say to a collegue at work ""I like you so much but you need to come back to the right path"" because they're LGBT (happens 5 times to a collegue in 2 years). 

I work with muslims since years, my SO is an ex-muslim, I know many atheists with north african roots and they all see the exact same problems. Maybe you work with ""educated"" muslims who integrated better. But saying young muslims are ""more progressive than old secularist"" is not only wrong, it's dangerous because it denies all the fights about feminism and LGBT acceptance"
62,emmqlcw,"This is where you are very, very mistaken dear. Those laws are to be regarded for a safe boundaries between both gender. And I can assure you with 100% certainty that nearly all of our practicing feel more comfortable with the separation. And there is nothing there which benefits us (men) over them.

You would need to learn. You will get an well educated Islamic view point and that is the point. Biasness is just a human trait. No offence, but I'm noticing it in you right now. However you cannot assume before you meet. They will give you the right answer and the right reasons.

As for Islam breeding hatred?... That isn't the true nature of our religion and please excuse the idiotic fanatics among us. Yes, religion does often harbour dangerous individuals who will take verses out of their contexts and apply them to their agenda. The Islamic community is no exception. The Qur'an itself and multiple hadiths speak against such behavior. Killing is only right during war, capital punishments and self-defence. In the context of war you aren't even allowed to target civilians.

This is why it is important to talk to our learned brothers. Islam is an extremely misunderstood religion and the more you learn about it the more you'll come to realise it."
63,eiob7yb,"Right, but the whole ""it will happen in the future"" argument is getting sort of old. I watched the al gore film, and remembered his predictions. Then I saw these predictions change as the dates approach. Climate change is absolutely fucking real, nobody can deny that, but it's not going to cause an  instantly unlivable planet. Mass migration will increase in the future, but it will be driven by the SAME civil unrest that it always has. Of note, almost all major conflicts in the world are currently islam- anti-islam conflicts right now. This is the cause of mass migration, not climate change. Islamic fundamentalists are not blowing people up on a daily basis because of climate change. The longer you ignore reality, the more dangerous it becomes. 

I've yet to hear a liberal response on how we control climate change, and deal with the fact that the average muslim family is rapidly growing in population, thus expending more CO2, while also moving to countries that use much more CO2 per capita. I would love to hear this explanation."
64,e51rb3h,"There's a fine line between stopping propaganda and censorship, I'll admit. 

However, do you really want all the advertisements to be different dictators, Nazis, Russia, Myanmar, South Africa or religious zealots to be able to jam the airwaves in other countries with similar advertisements? Africa isn't violently taking farms from white farmers, they're just providing land for a bunch of happy poor non-white people. Myanmar isn't committing genocide, just look at how happy this refugee Muslim family is. The Nazis aren't hate filled and unfulfilled, they're helping young white men get the respect and services they deserve, etc. 

It's dangerous, I agree, but I'm with the regulator on this one. "
65,ducroek,"I agree when he says “all religions are wrong and dangerous.”  And he follows that with “some are more dangerous than others.”  

By this I take it he means that all religions have the same potential for violence, but one huge one (Islam) IS violent today.  It’s a religion with a huge hardcore base that is defined by oppression and violence towards women and non Muslims.  

It is certainly the case that the vast majority of Muslim individuals are non violent people and will never commit any atrocities or be violent towards anyone... but, of that vast majority, there is a huge number who, when they see a gay person thrown off a building to their death, or a woman being beaten or acid in her face, say:  “Hey, that’s great!  I’m happy to see that happening because that is what my religion says is the right thing to do.  

Extremists of ANY religion may be non violent, but they are happy to see violence against people they think their religion says is wrong.  Bill is just pointing out that there is one religion today that has a huge number of these types of extremists.  

"
66,dna5o58,"1) I am sure, because unlike America, Europe doesn't have the opportunity to pick and choose the best among them to migrate. Past governments decades ago just chose workers, and in the last few decades we get whomever takes the long hike or boat... Our islamic community is the least open and least accepting community in our country. Even the far right here doesn't fight gay marriage anymore, but violence against gays is still on the rise and it only has one source.

2) That's so sad: my way or the highway. Seems like almost every American on here is like that, it's strange. I'm used to much more respect for people with different opinions, as that's the only way to have an open and non-adversarial discussion about ideas. In my view: Trump-, Sanders- and Clinton-supporters who think like that are all dangerous to democracy. I guess it's more of an American disease to totally disrespect anyone from your own culture with a different opinion. Maybe I'd get more leniency from you to have different ideas if I wasn't white ... probably.

3) Thinking about the downsides of globalization and thinking of solutions that would make life better is such a harmful thing to do, isn't it. Let's just accept the downward trend and go on with it?"
67,dm86ue7,"Some Muslims are perfectly accepting of gay people, but a majority believe it should be against the law.

That's where sending this poor girl to live with a Muslim family is unsettling, because it's more likely that the family's attitude towards homosexuality will be outdated and lead to the girl being raised with a dangerous, inaccurate view towards homosexual people."
68,dm88scs,"&gt; and then you continue to judge them as if they were a homogenous group in the rest of the comment.

No. I've highlighted the words you've not paid attention to.

.

&gt; Sure but if you think we should be wary of Muslims because of the views of 52%, then it's hardly a stretch to say that Britain in the 21st century is a welcoming place for gay people

Haven't seen any surveys saying a majority of non-Muslims in the UK believe homosexuality should be illegal. Your survey shows 42% believe it to be unnatural, but that's a bit different."
69,dmv1h5k," Abu_Adderall,

It's almost 10 years to the day since Sh. Salman al-Oudah delivered this message:

---

Brother Osama:

How much blood has been spilled? How many innocent children, women, and old people have been killed, maimed, and expelled from their homes in the name of “al-Qaeda”?

Are you happy to meet Allah with this heavy burden on your shoulders? It is a weighty burden indeed – at least hundreds of thousands of innocent people, if not millions.

How could you wish for that? – after knowing that Allah’s Messenger said: “Whoever as much as kills a sparrow in vain will find it crying before Allah on the Day of Judgment: ‘My Lord! That person killed me in vain. He did not kill me for needful sustenance.”

This religion of ours comes to defense of the life of a sparrow. It can never accept the murder of innocent people, regardless of what supposed justification is given for it.

Didn’t you read where the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “One of the prophets once sat under a tree and was bitten by an ant. Because of this, he burnt the ant’s nest. Thereupon, Allah questioned him: ‘Why not only the one ant?’ ” [Sahîh Muslim]

Allah revealed to that prophet: “What? Just because one ant had bitten you, you have set fire to an entire nation that extols Allah’s glory!” [Sahîh Muslim (2241)]

If this is the case for a nest of ants, consider how much worse it must be to visit harm upon human beings.

Who is responsible for all of those young Muslim, who are still in the bloom of their youth, with all the zeal of their age, who have strayed down a path they have no idea where it is headed?

The image of Islam today is tarnished. People around the world are saying how Islam teaches that those who do not accept it must be killed. They are also saying that the adherents of Salafi teachings kill Muslims who do not share their views.

However, the reality of Islam is that our Prophet (peace be upon him) did not kill the treacherous hypocrites in his midst, even though Allah had revealed to him who they were and informed him that they were destined for the deepest depths of Hell. Why did he stay his hand? He gave the following reason: “I will not have people saying that Muhammad kills his companions.”

Brother Osama, what happened on September 11 – crimes that we have condemned vociferously since that very day – was the murder of a few thousand people, possible a little less than three thousand. This is the number that dies in the airplanes as well as in the towers. By contrast, Muslim preachers – who remain unknown and unsung – have succeeded in guiding hundreds of thousands of people to Islam, people who have ever since been guided by the light of faith and whose hearts are filled with the love of Allah. Isn’t the difference between one who kills and one who guides obvious?

Our Lord tells us: “Whosoever kills a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the Earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, and whoso saves the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the lives of all mankind.” [Sûrah al-Mâ’idah: 32]

Guiding one soul to knowledge and faith is a momentous achievement. It is what will earn us great blessings.

Brother Osama, what is to be gained from the destruction of entire nations – which is what we are witnessing in Afghanistan and Iraq – seeing them torn apart with plague and famine? What is to be gained from undermining their stability and every hope of a normal life? Three million refugees are packing into Syria and Jordan alone, not to mention those who are fleeing to the East and the West.

The nightmare of civil war which now reigns supreme in Afghanistan and Iraq brings no joy to the Muslims. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) heard about a man named Harb (meaning “war” in Arabic), he promptly changed his name to something else, because the Prophet hated war.

Allah says: “Fighting is prescribed for you, though you detest it.” [Sûrah al-Baqarah: 216]

War is something hateful that must only be resorted to under the most dire and compelling of circumstances when no other way is found.

Who stands to benefit from turning a country like Morocco, Algeria, Lebanon, or Saudi Arabia – or any other country for that matter – into a battlefield where no one feels safe? Is the goal to obstruct the government? Is that, then, the solution for anything?

Is this the plan – even if it is achieved by marching over the corpses of hundreds of thousands of people – police, soldiers, and civilians, even the common Muslims? Are their deaths to be shrugged off, saying: “They will be resurrected in the Hereafter based on the state of their hearts.”

Indeed, all of those who are slain will be resurrected based on the state of their hearts. The question we must ask ourselves, however, is in what state are we going to be resurrected? How are we going to find ourselves when we meet our Lord? How will it be for someone who has all those countless deaths weighing down upon him, whether he wants to own up to them or not?

The concern for conveying Islam’s message to humanity is one that can influence others and convince them. This is a far greater and far weightier concern than that of using brute force and violence to bend others to one’s will. “Allah sent His Messenger (peace be upon him) as a guide for humanity, not as a tax collector.” as `Umar b. `Abd al-`Azîz used to say.

Who is responsible – brother Osama – for promoting the culture of excommunication which has torn families asunder and has led to sons calling their fathers infidels? Who is responsible for fostering a culture of violence and murder that has led people to shed the blood of their relatives without remorse, rather than nurturing the spirit of love and tranquility that a Muslim family is supposed to have?

Who is responsible for the young men who leave their mothers crying; who abandon their wives; whose small children wake up every day asking when daddy is coming home? What answer can be given, when that father may very well be dead, or missing with no one knowing of his fate?

Who is responsible for Western governments attacking every charitable project in the world, so that the orphans, the poor, and the needy throughout the globe are deprived of food, education, and other essential needs? Who is responsible – brother Osama – for filling the prisons of the Muslim world with our youth, a situation which will only breed more extremism, violence, and murder in our societies?

Muhammad (peace be upon him) – my source of guidance as well as yours – is what he came with not enough for you? He was sent as a mercy for all humanity. Allah says: “And We sent you merely as a mercy for all humanity.” [Sûrah al-Anbiyâ’: 107]

The word “mercy” is not to be found in the lexicon of war. Where is the mercy in murdering people? Where is the mercy in bombing places? Where is the mercy in making people and places into targets? Where is the mercy in turning many Muslim countries into battlefields?

The Prophet (peace be upon him) brought all of Arabia under his sway without a single slaughter, despite all of the battles that were waged against him. The number of people who were killed during the twenty-three years of his mission were less than two hundred people. The Muslims who were killed during that time by their enemies were many times in excess of that number.

What do a hundred people in Algeria, or double that number in Lebanon, or likewise in Saudi Arabia hope to achieve by carrying out acts of violence – or as they say, suicide attacks? These acts are futile.

Let us say – purely hypothetically – that these people manage to take power somewhere in the world. What then? What can people who have no life experience hope to achieve in the sphere of good governance? People who have no knowledge of Islamic law to support them and no understanding of domestic and foreign relations?

Is Islam only about guns and ammunition? Have your means become the ends themselves?

That ideology that so many young people have embraced in many parts of the world, is it revelation from Allah that cannot be questioned or reconsidered? Or is it merely a product of human effort that is subject to error and to being corrected?

Many of your brethren in Egypt, Algeria and elsewhere have come to see the end of the road for that ideology. They realize how destructive and dangerous it is. They have also found the courage to proclaim in their writings and on the air that they were mistaken and that the path they had been on was the path of error. They admit that it cannot lead to anything good. They have sought Allah’s forgiveness for what has passed and have expressed their sincere regrets for what they had done.

Those with brave hearts need just as much to have courageous minds.

Do you not hear the voices of the pious scholars, those who worship Allah day and night and are truly heedful of Allah – don’t you hear them crying out with the very same words that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used when Khâlid b. al-Walîd, the commander-in-chief of his army, acted in error: “O Allah! I plead my innocence to You from what Khâlid has done.”

These same words still echo after 1400 years in the cries of the scholars of Islam: “O Allah! I plead my innocence to You from what Osama is doing, and from those who affiliate themselves to his name or work under his banner.”

"
70,dkhe7wt,"SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina – The gate to the old Ashkenazi synagogue is unlocked. There are no security cameras or metal detectors, no police vehicles parked out front. No one even takes your name as you walk in.
This might just be the synagogue with the least security in Europe – here, in a Muslim country where ethnic hatreds run deep. Could Bosnia and Herzegovina, the site of the worst genocide in Europe since the Holocaust, be the safest place on the Continent to be a Jew?
Jakob Finci, president of the Jewish community of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which numbers some 1,000, thinks it may well be.
“We think we’re safe here with open doors,” Finci, a mischievous-eyed septuagenarian tells Haaretz in a recent interview in his office in the synagogue, the only functioning Jewish house of worship in the entire country. “This country is one of the few free of anti-Semitism.”
People may know about the Muslim Bosniaks, Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats, and especially about the violent war between them in the 1990s. But not many are aware of the existence of a fourth religious and ethnic group here – the Jews, who have resided in this area for centuries.

Touted over the centuries as the “European Jerusalem” and “Jerusalem of the Balkans,” modern Sarajevo, the capital of and largest city in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was a cosmopolitan melting pot at the crossroads between East and West, ruled first by the Ottomans and then subsumed within the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
Its heady mix of cultures and religions is still very much in evidence on the city’s streets today, as Paris-style espresso bars vie for space with Turkish hookah lounges.
“What’s different for Sarajevo is we [the Jews] have been in a very good relationship with the neighbors,” Finci says. “After 450 years we’re very well incorporated into Bosnian society.”
Decimated in WWII
Never forced to live in ghettos, the Jews of what is modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina – most of them descendants of Sephardim (the Spanish and Portuguese Jews expelled from Spain in 1492) – were treated much better during Ottoman times than in most of Western Europe, according to Finci.
By the 1930s there were about 12,000 Jews in Sarajevo and another 2,000 elsewhere in the country, according to census figures quoted by Finci and other sources. But the population was decimated during the Holocaust: Some 10,000 of its members were killed by the Ustasa, Croation fascists who sympathized with the Nazi regime.
Even then, though, many Muslims tried to protect their Jewish neighbors, and their bravery is memorialized today at Sarajevo’s Jewish Museum, housed in a former Sephardi synagogue. Some Muslim individuals are listed there as Righteous Among the Nations.

The old Ashkenazi synagogue in Sarajevo, the only open one in the whole country. ""We think we’re safe here with open doors,” says Jewish community president Jakob Finci.
While part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia – formed in 1946 and comprising six Balkan republics – religious practice was discouraged in Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, explains Finci, the Jews there were treated well by Josip Broz Tito, the communist revolutionary who would later become president of Yugoslavia, because many of them had fought with Tito’s Partisans during World War II.
Subsequently, following the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, about half of Bosnia and Herzegovina's remaining population of 2,000 Jews fled to Israel, fearing the worst.
Finci was one of those who stayed on, feeling an obligation to his country and the local Jewish organizations that were heavily involved in providing humanitarian aid to their fellow Sarajevans, their neighbors, irrespective of their ethnicity or religion, since the city was under siege.
According to one story documented at the Jewish Museum here, which reads like a Hollywood screenplay, the Kavilios – a family of Bosnian Jews who had been hidden from the Nazis by their Muslim neighbors, the Hardagas – returned the favor 50 years later when they helped the Hardagas’ daughter escape the Sarajevo siege by bringing her to Israel, where she eventually converted to Judaism.
Although now depleted in numbers, Finci believes Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Jewish community will hold its own.
“What is a good sign is that in the last 15 years only one person left for Israel,” he says.
In fact, about 20 young, locally born Jews have moved back to Bosnia and Herzegovina from Israel in the past few years, Finci says, attracted by the desire to preserve their unique heritage, free university studies and the relaxed, work-lite lifestyle.
Then came a “baby boom.”

Sarajevo's Ashkenazi synagogue. “It’s a Muslim country, but European. Jews here never have any problems,” says a young worshipper named Andrea.
“In 2015 we suddenly got 10 newborns, which was a real miracle,” Finci says. “That means these young people think there is a future here for them.”
Festive Shabbat
While Shabbat is observed every Friday night at the ornate old Ashkenazi synagogue on the banks of the Miljacka river, the Sarajevo community lacks a full-time rabbi. A rabbi who was born in the country but is now based in Israel returns to officiate during High Holy Days.
At one Shabbat this month, about 40 members of the community turned out, with much of the service in Ladino – the historic language of the Spanish Jews. Afterward, the atmosphere was festive with the candelabra lit, the challah blessed, and wine and song.
One of those attending, 24-year-old Andrea, was born in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and said she celebrates the mix of cultures and tolerance in the country.
“Most of our neighbors are Muslim. It’s a tradition to go and drink coffee with the neighbors for Ramadan and eat baklava and sweets,” the music student says. “It’s a Muslim country, but European. Jews here never have any problems.”
Her friend, Tea, 21, agrees, adding, “People here are not interested in hating Jews.”
While most Bosnian Muslims are fiercely protective of their secular identity, in a country where a woman is more likely to don a miniskirt than a hijab, there have been fears of creeping Wahhabism, and some 200 people from Bosnia and Herzegovina have reportedly left to fight with the Islamic State group in the Middle East.

Jakob Finci, president of the Jewish community of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the Sarajevo synagogue. ""In the last 15 years only one person left for Israel,” he says.
But Finci, for one, thinks an attack against Jews on home soil like those in recent years in Western Europe is very unlikely. Terror aimed at Jews in Brussels or Paris is much more worthwhile for the perpetrators in terms of international press coverage than an attack in Sarajevo would be, he notes.
With far-right parties gaining ground, as well as a spate of deadly attacks on Jewish institutions in Paris in 2015 and Brussels in 2014, Jews in Western Europe may have reason to fear, Finci says. But in Bosnia, because of resurgent tensions between the Serbs, Croats and Muslims, no one pays them much attention.
“It doesn’t mean they like you,” he says. “But these three ethnic groups are too busy hating each other.”

71,erkegxu,"Well, you do have a point that the Muslim family is likely to be toxic. I don’t know any gay sons from Muslim families that have achieved acceptance personally, they exist, but we haven’t met. 

Also, sorry to hear about your heart attack, those things are fucking scary. 

Also sorry your mom tried to kill you, congratulation on survival, kudos on making a decision that her toxic relationship isn’t worth it. 

I will also say that the perspective you offer is illuminating as well. I understand why you think yours is a strong and perhaps desirable option. (But not the only, as we have stated) 

Whenever we feel emotionally invested in a value judgment we become vulnerable. When someone challenges us with a different viewpoint it is easy to take it personally. Reddit doesn’t offer the complex social messages that face to face contact does, or provide the same calming influence that public social settings offer. This tends to exacerbate internet bullying, which I have learned to guard against because of the very limited communication. I am glad we got to this place where we see each other’s points of view. That is ultimately what (in my experience) reddit is all about."
72,erl0rmm,"&gt; Well, you do have a point that the Muslim family is likely to be toxic. I don’t know any gay sons from Muslim families that have achieved acceptance personally, they exist, but we haven’t met.

There's one that has been pursuing me online for a few months. His family know about me, he has shown me to them on video chat. It depends a lot on what country, what region, and what brand of islam. (I could say the same of judaism. Jews range from ""really pro-gay"" to ""really anti-gay"".) He's in Jordan, which is surprisingly progressive about homosexuality. 

In the US, christian families are far more likely to be toxic-ally homophobic than muslim families. I know this isn't the image you are used to, but it has been studied. 

I don't count ""they're muslim so they're toxic"" or ""they're christian so they're toxic"" in my considerations, so much as ""they're religious so they may be toxic"". 

&gt; Also, sorry to hear about your heart attack, those things are fucking scary.

The important fact here is that I don't remember that day at all. I didn't find out for sure for about 5 months that they think I did indeed have a heart attack. The 6 strokes, on the other hand, were very scary to try to recover from. 

&gt; I will also say that the perspective you offer is illuminating as well. I understand why you think yours is a strong and perhaps desirable option. (But not the only, as we have stated)

Actually, based on my experience, I see it as a *very undesirable* option, just the least bad option in some circumstances."

76,ee0u7hv,"Repeat after me: BOUNDARIES ARE NOT BITCHY. BOUNDARIES ARE NOT BITCHY. BOUNDARIES ARE NOT BITCHY!

Now. If DH is on board with not going to dinner with FIL and everyone else for Valentine’s Day, Then you absolutely should just come out and say, “we really wanted to spend that day/evening with just the two of us. Please don’t feel like you’re leaving us out by attending a dinner with FIL and his SO without us, though! If you all would still like to get together for dinner, maybe we could all get together for something a little more informal on one of the other days they are in town.”

Start now with the boundaries. Stick to them. This shit almost caused a divorce between my husband and I. My FIL has gotten to the point now where he actually thinks before he opens his racist, bigoted, ignorant face around me because I have gotten so far beyond pissed/uncomfortable/disgusted by his remarks and his actions and have just decided to not hold back on putting him in his place when it gets too deep. He blazed his true colors of how he acts and speaks to and treats me in front of my husband this summer and I’ve never felt more loved and supported by my husband when he put him in his place and told him he will not ever speak to me that way again. (Thanks, babe. Told you I wasn’t making this shit up!)

I did what you did with your DH and told him that if he ever lets me have to suffer with being left alone with his father again, the man will probably have a heart attack because I will have him put in a home if he does or says the things he has in the past. I won’t put up with it anymore. No excuses. I respect that he’s my elder, a vet, my husbands father... but I will NEVER accept or excuse his piss poor attitude, inappropriateness, and complete lack of couth when it comes to his actions and behavior in public or in front of my children. 

If DH isn’t actually on board with not spending a couples exclusive holiday without his dad, then let him know - “If this is what we’re doing, you need to be on high alert, you need to have my back, and you need to keep him in line. If he puts us in a position where people around us see how he is acting and is being a fool, we will be leaving immediately. First course or dessert, we will be leaving.” 

If you go, do yourself a favor and let the small things slide... for example: at a fancy restaurant, my FIL would make some kind of comment about how “fucking stupid it is to have 3 forks for one meal...” or if he sees an attractive or well dressed woman he instantly calls her a high maintenance bitch with too much plastic surgery. I let these things slide because he’s actually just simple and can’t help that he was raised to think like that. These are small things.

When my FIL made the comment 2 years ago at a restaurant where there was a large group of Muslims sitting next to us, that the only reason they were at the restaurant wearing their traditional clothes was to “show off”... that’s when I made a complete ass out of him and loudly asked “Now why would you say these Muslim folks are showing off just because they are honoring their traditional clothing? I don’t understand? I am confused? Have you spoken to these people to determine that they are showing off?”  

The point here is some times people need to be given the opportunity to see what total asshats they are. I don’t make it a personal mission to oust my FIL every time we are with them. But he also has learned that I won’t associate with or tolerate someone who acts that way. So he’s calmed down. And we all get along mostly fine a majority of the time. 

Stand your ground, be firm, be polite, be direct. This is just how I handled my FIL. So it may not be the best approach for you, but in the long run, boundaries are important and not to be cast aside.

GOOD LUCK! I hope you enjoy your day either way!"
77,drg4v36,"My guess would be some of the areas of Dearborn and Minneapolis, of course I don't have proof.  These are fairly closed-off enclaves, not too welcoming to kafir like me.  

&gt;Can you name one Muslim politician that has tried to impose Sharia law? One place in America that is subject to Sharia law?

No, I can't, and I'd like to keep it that way.  Islam**ism** is incompatible with western culture - **Muslim Individuals** are not (mostly), so long as they can separate their religion from their politics.  

I understand your gripe about Christian do-gooder pols.  I *really* do.  But The Christian faith teaches us to be good to your neighbor, keep your head down and pay your taxes.  The Islamic faith teaches go to the unbelievers land and attack him and deceive him until you own it.  The Christian prophet/Son-of-God was a pacifist who lost his temper and knocked over some bankers' tables and eventually submitted himself to **State authority** and was crucified to death to save the WHOLE WORLD.  The Islamic prophet was a retarded goat farmer turned raper/pillager/cho-mo who prescribed the most violent and cruel treatment of women and unbelievers.   "

And yeah, the author seems very lucid, consistent, and logical. What he states about great replacement is real. It's not even a conspiracy. Blaming the Muslims was wrong (obviously). He states, more or less explicitly, what the problem is and what he is after specifically : globalism. Muslim individuals are not responsible for globalism. They are victims of it like most others. If I was a Muslim, whose country had been bombed by the US/nato, I would probably leave to some greener pasture too anyway. In that regards, the yellow vests protests make a lot more sense IMO, because they bring together everyone regardless of their social background, skin color. It's a genuine uprising against TPTB and their globalism agenda, and that's why the French gov and those in power are shitting their pants."
82,fj0ravf,"&gt; Wow. So, I’m assuming you’re an ex Muslim correct?

I am a never moose. So incorrect assumption/conclusion #1.

&gt; Not to prejudge, it’s just either you’re an ex Muslim who was told the hadiths are true, or you desperately need the hadiths to be a proper source to fit your arguments.

And bad assumption/conclusion #2. Not a good start.

Note, ""I"" am not making the argument that Aisha  was 6 when married, was 6 to 9 when used as a masturbatory aid, and was fucked when she was 9 years old, and that Mo has intercourse with a ""child."".  The narratives and sources from within the Islamic religion and culture are making the argument for me. I am merely presented it - and *then* adding my commentary as to the moral righteousness of such actions, and against the claim that Mo was, and still is, THE example of the most moral of men.

To use hadith/tafsir/fatwas (and Qur'anic ayah/ayat) in an argument against Islam, and the claims under Islam, is to use the narratives, doctrine, traditions, and findings, of Islam that are accepted as credible/canon by Muslims against itself. Using Islam in self-refutation of Islam, is just one of a number of argument/debate techniques to show the fallacy of Islamic apologistic arguments. Just as using the scripture of the Bible to refute Christian apologeticists and revisionists.

In short, Muslims accept Hadith/tafsir/fatwa, and have even gone as far as to developed an extensive methodology to assign authenticity to, and accept the authenticity of, the narratives.

I have not been told the hadith are true, nor do I need to have a ""proper"" (fully vetted historical) source - against the Islamic claims that the Prophet ""was the most morally perfect man, and a moral guide for all time"" I just *need* a source(s) that Muslims will accept *and* that do not have specific and reliable refutation by non-islamic sources.

&gt; Other historians like Fred Donner 

Donner posits/concludes in ""Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing"" that some hadith traditions may be sourced **from the time of Muhammad** to others sourced after Mo by decades or more.

So even the one poorly cited reference you have provided to support the non-historicity of ***all*** Hadith acknowledges some Hadith as contemporary. 

So, as requested above, what support do you have to the statements:

&gt;&gt;  I just think hadiths are full of shit. So yeah, none of what you say comes anywhere close to what I consider reliable information

&gt;&gt; Seriously though we’re not even entirely sure how old Aisha was

against the different Hadith I presented via the link:  https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/anrv7t/aisha_was_not_6_when_she_got_married_to_the/efvofmb/ are not credible? Please feel free to go through the long list of Hadith and tafsir and provide an argument and sources that give an author date and source to demonstrate support or non-credibility via an argument of ""written hundreds of years later by people heavily involved in politics"" to each hadith that identifies Aisha's age.

The preponderance of narrative evidence from Islamic sources for Islam, having undergone an authentication and ranking process by pro-Islam scholars/individuals/organizations - thereby establishing credibility to Muslims and those within the Islamic community - is an accepted source of information for discussion/debate of issues within Islam. Unless credible cause is provided to give supportable reason why it should not be accepted.

&gt;  She **could have** lied about her age to show she knew Muhammad for a very long time.

Speculative ""could have""? Really? You are undermining any claim from an argument from authority as ""an outsider trained in investigative history"" by the unsupported speculative nature of ""could have.""

&gt; I wouldn’t be surprised if Muhammad married her young. Happened all the time.

&lt;[ducks those goalposts](https://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/moving-goalposts-gif.gif)&gt; Almost got me!

The issue is not a child marriage. The issue is Mo sexually assaulting and the equivalent of statutory raping of a girl-***child*** whilst being presented as a bringer of the Absolute [Moral] Word of Allah and as a claimed 'most morally perfect of all men' within the confines of early Islamic culture and society and against nearly every other cultural moral system. 


Please note that I am fully cognizant of the unreliability of testimonial witness (as a claim of history). However, in light of the lack of other more credible evidence that refutes testimonial witness narratives, the testimonial witness narratives is the best evidence available.

Finally, since the original argument is that the Prophet Mo is sexually morally deviant and does not meet contemporary nor current moral sexual norms - and you wish to refute these arguments by dismissing, in mass, the primary source of evidence available, an evidence source accepted by the Islamic in general (where this same Islamic population also calls Mo the most morally perfect of men and an example for all time)  - I have to *assume* (heh) that you would also support the the slave taking, killing/murder, and robbing, that Mo conducted, ordered, and benefited from, is merely a fable made up by enemies of Islam; and summarily dismiss the extra-Islamic sources that attest to these reprehensible moral action of the Prophet. Yes?"
83,fjzbflc,"It's a bit of both though, isn't it? You can change the mind of pretty much anyone  about anything, but with religious people in general it's just that much harder because no matter how many facts and reason you bring them, their book trumps everything you say.  


There are things that are cultural like the burqa and niqab and the general idea that women need to hide themselves or get stoned to death. This is 100% cultural and not to be found anywhere in the quran, at least from what I've heard from a number of prominent imams who have spoken on the issue. Then there are things that are in the texts (both the old testament and Quran) where it explicitly mandates death to certain individuals such as homosexuals etc.   


I don't get why people get so offended and downvote criticism of religion on a subreddit specifically made for people who are daily murdered because of religion. I would get it if it was unwarranted critique and directed towards muslims and/or arabs as a group, because that is blatant bigotry and racism. But critiquing the religious ideas and practices and the horrors that come out of it needs to be done.  


And it's not only a problem in teocratic countries like Saudi Arabia or Iraq, there are also problems in Sweden, even though they are sometimes less obvious.

 Swedish television did a program where they went to a bunch of imams and asked what they would tell a woman who came for help because she was assaulted by her husband. The imam said he would help her get in contact with police and get help.  


Then they sent a muslim woman with a hidden camera to the same imams a few weeks later, and she told the imams about her abusive husband who beat her ever so often. The imam assured her that this was just the husbands way of telling her she's done something wrong and nothing out of the ordinary. She asked if she should call the police and if he could help her and he refused and strongly advised against her doing it herself, telling her that she should just try and talk to her husband about it.  


Suggesting that Christianity, at least in 1st world countries, is comparable to the problems in the Islamic community is nothing but a mockery of the struggles of muslim women and lgbt people in the muslim community who cannot get out of their situation for fear of death.   


If we are not allowed to talk about these problems for what they are without being accused of bigotry and racism we cannot hope to find peaceful ways to solve them."

Islam is not like that. Islam (Allah) calls for the massacre, murder and genocide of non-believers. If calls for the enslavement of women and children. Only if the Islamic community is powerful enough to do it though...

88,dvm53ml,"Good examples. Thanks for taking the time and sharing with me. I’d love to show you why I don’t find most of that to be a problem. 

1. Private convo with his friend that he publicly apologized for. Didn’t even need to apologize imo. My girlfriend has said worse things lol. I literally could not care less about this one, it was simply used as a political weapon to make him look bad. Literally everyone talks about “getting ass” and “sucking dick” all the time. And he just joked about it in context, he didn’t even do anything as far as we know. 

2. That’s hilarious and it’s true. Fuck Hillary I have no sympathy for her and her rapist husband who she defended by threatening the women he ACTUALLY RAPED. 

3. I’m with you on that, very distasteful and unbecoming. Shouldn’t say that. 

4.  Also with you 100%. 

5. So what? I’m totally against the Islamization of UK, they’re creating no-go zones right now, tomorrow there will be Sharia law zones. I’m glad he retweeted it. I’m also a UK citizen so yes I do care. 

6. Well other religious migrants aren’t randomly exploding. Islam is an ideology, a choice, and like every ideology it deserves to be criticized. It’s the reason that Genocide was committed on my people. Almost 2 million of my people were eradicated in the name of Allah. My great great grandfather was murdered because of Islam. My family literally escaped death from Islam and now that we’re free it’s just coming back again. Hell no. Muslim individuals are fantastic people, but Islamic ideologies are a cancer to western civilization, there’s enough evidence of that fact in all of history. I’m all for the temporary withholding of migrants from nations with Islamic theocracies. I like my gay friends alive, my thoughts free of blasphemy, and my women with equal rights.

You could steal from a store and they might never notice, it's still a crime. If you cheat on your wife, you've broken the trust you've placed in each other. 

She would be a victim if she found out. 

No one would be a victim if a homosexual relationship was 'found' out. 

If you perceive your actions as criminal and have to hide it, then you've done something wrong. Homosexuals don't perceive their actions as criminal, nor do they want to hide it.

If you had bothered to read any of the inquiry reports about many of these grooming gangs, then you would realize that their pimping and rape of young, vulnerable girls forms part of their wider criminal enterprise that involves trafficking heroin, guns etc. 

Now, I'm not an expert on any Abraham religion, but I do doubt just how 'pious' these supposed Muslims are. I mean, on one hand the Islamic community is attacked for being too Conservative, yet on the other they are attacked for the actions of these groups who obviously have different attitudes towards drugs, alcohol etc. 

Apart from the odd individual who is connected to a local mosque, where explicitly is there evidence that they are practicing Muslims and that these religious beliefs in their eyes legitimize their actions. Are you not assuming that they are strict adherents to Islam because their names are Middle eastern sounding? Would you apply this same assumption to every white Smith or Johnson that you see? That they are obviously pious Christians and that all of their behavior is derived from their religious beliefs?

There's no doubt that these people need to be locked up, and this has been happening since the mid-2000s, long before people like Tommy Robinson took it up as a cause. Now I want to see the police going after the local Councillors and rogue individual policemen who allowed it to happen and obfuscated cases. However, condemning such a large minority body for the actions of such a comparably small part of it is non-nonsensical.

92,f1cr0fc,"There were Muslim suburbs and areas that voted majority Republican. You had some leaders push for Republicanism pre-9/11.

That scholar is only pointing out that the Islamic community is not monolithic and some vote Republican and some don’t. 

But if Muslims are embraced by Dems it’s only to the extent that they’re an enemy of Republicans. It’s part of the US political system and culture that if one side is against a group, the other will adapt to embrace them. Shadi Hamid articulates how that’s a feature of the US very well. 

I liked their “political nomads” metaphor, because it’s an apt description of US Muslims. And because eternal allegiance to Dems will render Muslims impotent in the long term, IMO."

I was raised Muslim (family is Pakistani) and for some reason Pakistanis have a weird thing where they're way more concerned (to the point of borderline obsession) about atrocities happening to Palestinians than they are atrocities happening to their own people (not just in Kashmir but also Amerikan drone strikes, rampant corruption in the country's political system, western corporations exploiting the hell out of Pakistani workers in sweatshops/mines, extreme poverty depending on which part of the country you're in). My father is a huge antisemite who holds /pol/-tier beliefs about Jews being behind all the world's problems, as if capitalism and imperialism are nothing more than part of a secret Zionist world domination plot.

But western *comrades* who should know better repeating these kinds of tropes makes me even angrier. It's orientalist, because it constructs an image of us brown folk as ultra-dignified communist jihadis and sees every aspect of our culture (both good and shitty) as de facto resistance to western hegemony. I've been gaslighted more times than I can remember based on this line of thinking. Every time I would mention all the shitty things about my ex-community I'd get wishy-washy responses which implied I shouldn't criticize because ""the West"" is a bigger enemy, and conservative Sunnism can be a weapon against the West. No, I think both of them suck. "
94,dlhd08m,"The jiyza tax is not spoken of throughout the entire Quran.  It comes up in a couple places. It is not currently practiced anywhere in the Muslim world.

Its important to remember in the Arab world, Muslims were the minority so it wasn't the punishment some say it is.  It is a tax they payed instead of zakat.  And it was flexible.  Elderly and sickly didn't pay the jizya tax, for instance. Some payed much less than was required.  The dhimmis were not required to fight in battles, but were promised protection and the jizya tax covered this also.

It no doubt was a less equal arrangement than the Muslims had, but it was nothing evil as people have made it out to be.  And what parts become evil are patriarchal not Quran or sunnah.

Slavery is no longer part of shariah or Islamic doctrine.  No more than it is part of Judaism or Christianity in our times.  Jesus commanded slaves to treat their masters as if they were the Lord Himself.  Muslims have rejected slavery.  The west also condones it, by not fighting human trafficking more intensely.  It is typically never mentioned in the news.  No one knows or cares, depending on how you believe newscasters decides to air stories.

Not banishment really.  Islam developed in a tribal area.  The clans were typically based on familiar relationship so Islamic community was the first to do so by religion.  Telling a pagan he has 3 choices if he wants to be part of the islamic community is offering him an opportunity to stay with Muslims (ie-family members who converted).  But typically a pagan will already be attached to a tribe.  And the tribes had forced the Muslims to relocate thinking it was the only way to be safe....but even then the enemy tribes came after the Muslims after they migrated.

There are beautiful Muslims from the Middle East out there. I've met them. They love to have people in their homes. They follow the true tenets of Islam. Then there are those out there who are just as ignorant as your average religious right nutjob and who are just as strict. Whenever I see someone in your shoes, about to go into a situation where a judgmental, temperamental, and strict Muslim family is what they are marrying into I advise them against it strongly.

He did. He also had to lead and regulate a community for over a decade, unlike Jesus who did all of his preaching from the point of a wandering preacher over the course of around a year. There's a reason Jesus didn't lead an army, he never had one. Looking at Muhammad's preaching compared to Jesus' they're amazingly similar when Muhammad was in the same position as Jesus.

100,f9n8tmi,"A very Indian take on things. 

Pakistan doesn't have an identity crisis, I'm pretty sure every leader and citizen would say we're South Asian apart from Pashtun who are culturally Central Asian. 

Pakistan's shift towards ""Middle Eastern"" Islam is ironically false considering the extremists identify with Deobandism and Barelvism which literally started in Uttar Pradesh with Wahhabis being a very small and insignificant minority. Also Iranian Islam is also very different considering there are numerous Marja (religious authorities) in Iran with differing views and the Pakistani Marja follow Ayatollah Sistani in Iraq not Ayatollah Khamenei. The Shia clergy prior to 1979 also had significant sway in the country particularly the rural areas and amongst the poor who made up the majority of the populace, a revolution can't happen without the majority being on board with it, the Shah and his supporters were always the minority. Even to this day Pakistan's politicians still follow either local Sufi, Shia or Sunni Ulemma if they are religious as does the majority of the population, you are still stuck in the Zia era which has long gone.

Pakistan also doesn't state Kashmir belongs to them but affirms its stance that there should be a plebiscite, the stance that Kashmir belongs entirely to them is the Indian one. The 1948 fiasco was also perpetrated in response to hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees reaching Pakistan telling tales of slaughter under the Dogra Raj which have motive to tribal Pashtun, Potohari Punjabis and, Hindkowans Hazara from Quetta. There were also rebellions in what is now AJK especially in Poonch and in Gilgit Baltistan that were indigenous. 

The calls for Kashmir are no different to what India says on a global scale regarding Balochistan, the Islamic community is put into mind mainly because that is how nations work. Indonesia appealed to Islamic nations as did Afghanistan and Bosnia, do they have an identity crisis too? Serbia appealed to Slavic and Orthodox nations such as Greece and Russia. It's how diplomacy works, if there is a common ground and interests then you go towards that common ground. Also the calls wouldn't be incessant, would the US talking about Hong Kong be incessant? It's a fact that India has virtually kept Kashmir under lockdown cut off from the rest of the world and even jailing pro-state politicians and with it's own diplomats calling for an ""Israel solution"" where land be given to Hindu settlers for demographic change which goes against the original document that allowed Kashmir to be taken over by India in the first place."

It argued that second-generation extremism happens for two reasons: 1) feeling they dont belong in their host country nor their emigrated country and 2) rose tinted nostalgia for their parents country, and as they never grow up there they don't know the horrors of extremism. A good proportion of the terror attackers recently have been second-generation migrant. I think increases in this second/third-generation migrant level will result in more extremism. I think its short sited and unfair for the next generation to not address this issue because they will be the ones dealing with it. Whether that's investing in more integration programs, or reassessing immigration rates - looking at the data something needs to be done.

However, as per everything the higher rate of extremism in second generation migrants is most likely a combination of multiple factors: Wahhabi founding, archaic religious customs, inspiration from over seas terror groups, not being welcomed at host countries and so on. To solve on of these issues, I think the fastest way for Muslims to integrate is to reform Islam. [This Pew Research is terrifying](https://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-morality/), almost no non-western Muslims believe Homosexuality is fine while about half people believe honour killings are acceptable. Its hard for host countries to accept immigrants normally, but much more difficult when almost all of them are extremists. 

I also want to say that I honestly have nothing wrong with Muslim people, in my lab I work with many Islamic people and a girl I hang out with often prays in my office. I understand that were all people at the end of the day. But the indoctrination of Muslims to become extremists by the greater Islamic community is what is causing these problems. And until we reform Islam, I honestly think slowing Immigration from Muslim countries is the safest option at the moment."
102,emh796v,"YTA because I would say you are culturally biased. How many muslims do you know personally. Just because a muslim family is devout does not make make them extremist. Similarily just because a christian family is devout does not mean they are an extremist family.

Any ways removing culture and religion and how you describe your son. Maybe he is lucky he was born into a rich family. Maybe if he was poor no girl would like him"
103,eils6ok,"Not a good look right now. As of last year it's nearly 100% of the extremist attacks in the US. When the Islamic community is grooving, and we just saw a white supremacist gunman qoute Pewdiepie while shooting a mouaqe...  maybe it's not the time to talk about Islamic extremism... and focus on the real problem at hand right now. I understand some right winger might take what I'm saying wayyyy out of context, but I feel like this is a ""both sides"" ism..."
104,eireh3t,"It's not a justification of the shooting, it's an explanation of it.

The point they're making is that radicalisation in the Islamic community is provoking retaliation from right wing extremists and also needs to be addressed so that we can prevent more incidents like this one.

As long as they are freely practicing their religion and not hurting others then it doesn’t really matter. I really don’t think that you know many people who practice Islam. The extremists stand out but they do as well in Christianity.

109,e5n4kcb,"So you're now saying that Jew is not a race? I use Jew and Jewish interchangeably. To use your argument, when someone refers to a Muslim, they are usually thinking about an Arabic Muslim. A white Muslim will face less discrimination than an Arabic Muslim. My point is that the way distinctions are made between Muslims and Jews is pretty similar, if not the same.

Trump isn't a racist, a sexist, or a traitor. You don't know the reasons I voted for him, yet you label me an idiot for voting for him. You are a hateful person. You come up with this elaborate explanation to justify your hate. I am happy at least to see you are somewhat consistent, admitting that hating Muslims simply for being Muslim is similar to hating Trump supporters simply for being Trump supporters, because they both are a choice. Your next step is to admit that it's wrong to hate Muslims and wrong to hate Trump supporters simply for believing what they believe. You don't know if a Muslim is a fundamentalist, or why they believe what they believe until you meet them. In the exact same way, you don't know if a Trump supporter is an extremist, racist, or what they believe until you meet them. 

I would also argue against the distinction between Muslims growing up a certain way. Most Trump supporters grew up a certain way. In general, the way we grow up has a tremendous influence on who we are. Obviously a child born into a Muslim family is much more likely to be a Muslim when they grow up. In the same way, a kid born into a family with certain philosophies and values will be much more likely to be a Trump supporter than a Hillary supporter. I myself grew up surrounded by both liberals and conservatives, so it's not much of a surprise that I have voted for both Obama and Trump. 

You will also notice that i'm not calling you an idiot and calling you names. "

111,dxmzi80,"What you bring up is the issue Sam Harris and Maajid touched upon many times, and certainly in this podcast: people don't want to talk about issues in religion, especially not in a religion such as Islam. This makes any attempt to talk about the religion in a critical manner taboo (""appeal to xenophobia"").

I will concede that many people in the west have an irrantional fear of Muslim individuals, but that doesn't undermine the fact that there is a fundamental problem with Islam, and with Muslims, especially ""moderate"" Muslims, that permits the existence of fundamentalism and literalism (ie *extremism*). Those very core problems were crucial in my critical thinking about my religion and ultimately deciding that I want no part in it; they are the reason that despite of my dislike for organized religion and my problems with an Abrahamic deity, I especially have an unmatched dislike for the religion of Islam. It's easy to go on the left side of the argument and say ""no you can't dislike, you can't criticize,"" (and yet do the exact opposite when it comes to Christianity, as Sam points out) when you have never read a word of the Qur'an or Hadith to realise that the issue is not with the extremists, but with the religion. And the moderate Islamic community is just as guilty of perpetuating this.

But of course you get the likes of Ben Affleck getting emotional when you criticize."
112,dmez0w0,"The blog is a lie.

Here is a non-tabloid source, which the blog for some reason fails to link to:

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/30/child-in-fostering-row-should-live-with-non-practising-muslim-grandmother

""A report in the Times, based on confidential internal documents from Tower Hamlets council, said the child had been found to be “very distressed” after a necklace with a Christian cross was taken from her and she was banned from eating bacon.""

vs. the blog

""There is no evidence, apart from claims by the tabloid press, that the temporary foster parents have banned crucifixes and bacon from the home. There is also no mention of this according to court documents by either the mother herself or the lawyers representing her. The press simply lied.""

The blog claims

""According to court documents, the child herself is from Muslim heritage and her Muslim grandmother has now been cleared by the courts to look after her. This fact is only disputed by the girl’s mother but none of this was mentioned by the tabloids as it would obviously totally destroy their narrative:""

Muslim 'heritage' does not make you a Muslim. Richard Dawkins has Christian 'heritage'. Islam is not a race, like Judaism. In South Asia people of the same race may be for instance Hindu or Muslim.

If the mother's parents are non-religious Muslims, and the mother says she is Christian, then that suggests in fact that the girl is not in any way shape or form Muslim, and therefore a placement with a Muslim family is inappropriate.

Surely we are not endorsing the apostasy/impossible-to-renounce-Islam concepts beloved by Islamic extremists?"
113,dijd0cl,"A lot of this is in response to folks asking ""well, where were the muslims when x happened?"" Or folks assuming all Muslims are accepting of extremist behavior because they happen to not see the parts where muslim folks stand against said behavior. 

Muslim folks are being scrutinized as a whole for the doings of extremists, so I find it fair that these sorts of stories are ran."
114,djsuu4e,"I'm currently reading the full report as it's only 14 pages long. From the executive summary i broadly agree with what they're saying, but stopping middle eastern influence in the UKs Islamic community is only part of the solution. Given how vital Saudi Arabia is to Western foreign policy, i also think it's among the trickiest places to start. Tackling grass roots problems in the UK with regard to integration and early intervention in those reported to prevent should take precedence. 

I also hold a small amount of sympathy with the fact that Saudi Arabia is correct in stating that it has to deal with radical Islamic terror as well. The extremist groups we all seek to get rid of are no friends to the Saudi Royal Family.

I also didn't intend to bring the actual report into disrepute, just found it interesting how some commentors here were hailing certain sections of the HJS core beliefs despite these beliefs being in part responsible for the middle eastern mess we are all aghast at."
115,diiy8tv,"Yeah, if CAIR made this much noise about how the attacks come from extremists who twist the ideals, I might be interested.

116,dkaoa1r,"It's dumb that they removed that, but the post itself was a dumb soundbite either way.

First of all, ""-phobia"" is the go-to suffix for bigotry - just like the ""hate"" in ""hate speech"" is a code word for bigotry that doesn't actually need to be hateful, and doesn't refer to any hatred that falls outside those categories.

I'm not a fan of this whole code wording nonsense (it's a natural thing in language, but this is one of those ""official"" areas in which langage should be more precise), and a lot of those words have become annoying over the years - however, insisting on literal reading when *those who say it don't mean it etymologically*, is just dumb.

Secondly, can fear, or generally apprehensions about Islam be irrational? Well, unless your view is that every benign looking muslim family is likely to be practicing taqiyya, or have extremists in their social circle and join them, then yes, they can be irrational; and so are obviously statements like ""99% muslims are crazy barbarians"" or ""there are no peaceful readings of Islam"".

So no, not an oxymoron and quit spreading that dumb meme already - all you do is lose credibility."
117,di3mh0k,"It definitely is true, there are so many people out there that legitimately believe the Islamic community is far less likely to shun the acts of extremists and even go as far as agree/protect them. Its why there are even political movements about there needing to be higher surveillance in the muslim community and all those people backing up Trump when he says muslims need to take responsibility and start reporting suspicious people in the community rather than hiding them under protection. I've always seen a handful of comments on threads about how muslims are always more likely to uphold sharia and sympathize with radicals making them the least likely to act against extremists in their community. The truth is from what i've seen muslims resent these people the most considering how badly these extremists tarnish their reputation and make life hard for them while making muslims in the middle east their very own victims."

Ben Shapiro says dumb shit all the time. [Have you seen his stance on how a ""tiny radical Muslim family"" is a myth?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7TAAw3oQvg) He claims that blaming the US or another country means you're a radical Muslim. Watch the entire video. Every single time he takes a poll or a datapoint and completely changes the idea about the data. 

Like saying wanting Sharia Law means you're radicalized. He says this every single time. He is a fucking moron. No one in their right mind would ever argue something as stupid as that. And if you call it out for what he is really doing, you obviously are going to say ""oh so I'm racist, because I hate muslims?"". Come on now. He does this on most topics. Things like gender/sex and socialism. He always does this. 

Excuse it by him pushing a narrative. That's even worse. That means you can't use the ""oh I say one thing and I'm instantly racist?"" defense. Because then you're confirming it. Let's pretend that's not the case. That means he's an idiot."
122,e37q0vh,"I'm all for wiping out radical Islamists, they are a disease to be purged no doubt.

124,dp0tt7t,"Idk how deep you want me to get into this, but here's some of the most important reasons (for me):

1. I was listening to a lecture about non Muslims and ex Muslims, and how they **should** be treated versus how they are **actually** treated. A lot of it was common sense imo, but I guess some radical fundamentalist in the ME would beg to differ (fuck him though). 

2. You guys deserve to be advocated for. I don't understand for the life of me how you'll find a ""Muslim"" fast all of Ramadhan, go to Hajj, read Quran, the whole nine, yet he's the most judgemental person in the world. Always imposing his beliefs on others and making them feel like shit if they're not as good as him. That ""holier than thou"" mentality. I hate that shit. 

Some Muslims act like they've been oppressed each and every day. But they don't go through what you guys go through. They're not shunned from society, they're not told they're going to hell, but unfortunately, many of you guys are. We all deserve free choice of beliefs. It says that in the Quran (even though many of you despise the book), ""there is no compulsion in religion"" and yet you'll find many Muslims do it anyway. 

Idk, it's like that Kendrick Lamar song ""wanna be heard"" imo. You guys have a voice too. But Muslim society forces you to stay quiet and that's fucked up.

3. I've never been through the physical/mental/emotional abuse that many of you have been through, but my heart goes out to you guys because you don't deserve that shit. Everyone thinks that every Muslim family is normal, but the stuff that you guys post proves otherwise. 

I know many of you dislike Muslims while others dislike Islam, and I don't blame you. If I walked a mile in your guys  shoes I'd probably think the same. But I just want you guys to know that I still respect you guys as individuals like you ought to be treated. 

Shit, if you were my friend, I'd invite you to watch football, basketball, and eat some dank food. I wouldn't dissociate with you just because you left Islam. 

Overall those are my reasons. As a Muslim, I advocate for your guys equal rights as me, and this sub makes my reasons real. I had a fellow Muslim come up to me once and tell me how ex Muslims are bad, and I went off on him because he didn't know what you guys endured. Like I said, y'all deserve to be heard and represented. 

I hope you guys stay healthy, safe, happy, and respected/loved.

125,dlshge5,"I agree that if a group of radical Islamists calling for the fall of American infidels, you should be able to ban them. But banning a peaceful Muslim family is not okay. 

The difference between the two groups is that one group is minding their own business while the other is being belligerent and creating an unsafe environment for those around them.

Similarly, nazis by their very nature create an unsafe environment. Their belief in racial superiority and even potential support of ethnic cleansing is inherently threatening.

126,diih63b,"Yes, I agree it's a slippery slope, and it should really be more of a social movement than government, due to the potential for abuse. And you're right, I do agree with the quote, I just agree with the nature in which people reference it, frequently, and correctly, used to point out government censorship that is not about making people safer but about preventing criticism or investigation into government actions. 

I suppose what I'm arguing for is a complete societal shift in attitudes towards these religions, and primarily Islam. I know it's not necessarily a popular opinion, but I'm sick of people expressing stories of how Islam is actually peaceful, and it's not really problematic because the Muslim family down the street always seem so nice. The core teachings of Islam teach some truly horrible and reprehensible shit, and for whatever reason, time and time again Islam and the Islamic community is given a pass on it. There was that video of Q &amp; A after Manchester where a man talked about a flyer he'd been given that said Western Society values and views were wrong. A young Muslim girl even commented later that there was an elephant in the room with Islamic teachings and views of Muslims, yet the concerns of this girl and the man were dismissed by another Muslim woman who said these views simply were not accurate. No further discussion, just hand waving away what are serious and endemic problems within Islam. 

As it stands now, I think we are very much heading down a path that will only see continued acts of radical Islamic violence, simply because we aren't prepared to use all measures to tackle it, much of it failed government policy, but also social views and attitudes that desperately need to change. If we continue down this path, there will be a point in time where things start to boil over, and there is the potential for very real violent backlashes again Muslims, which will only serve to further exacerbate and deteriorate matters.

127,g048uzh,"Sure, but in the west, islamophobia is rooted in and tied up in racism, especially as many/most Muslim folks are black and brown. 

I’m an atheist and gay, and am understandably against organized religion in general, especially “the big three” (Christianity, Judaism, Islam), as I think they infringe on human rights. But my dislike of judaism, say, is not the same as anti-semitism (hatred of Jewish *people*). 

Islamophobia is not really about people taking issue with their Islam as a faith, although that’s there: it’s a larger more loaded, disdainful hate for “barbaric brown people”. This is why mosque shootings happen, why random attacks on people who are wearing hijab happen, why people like Jagmeet Singh get verbally harassed for being Muslim—even though he’s Sikh!

TLDR islamophobia is not about disliking the religion, which fair, but a racist disliking of the people."
128,fyyzq19,"I was born muslim (family is half christian half muslim) in a christian country, I don't really really practice the religion so I sort of qualify.

I am obviously biased, but since my family is half-half i wasn't forced in either one, at their core all the 3 major religions are more or less the same one, they all believe in pretty much the same things, the differences are minor mostly, or, at the very least not worth the hate towards each other.

My choice for islam was mostly because the religion doesn't dismiss other prophets or religions,  Moses and Jesus are both prophets, among others.

What pushed me away from Christianity was the fact that jesus is considered the son of god and it has many translations.

But again, overall all of them share the same beliefs, I'll never understand why some people can't get along because of their beliefs, it is not like one of them is asking you to be a cannibal or anything like that."

“Tourists”.

Islam is kind of a club and if you aren’t Arab you aren’t “in it”. I hate to say this but it’s true, been thinking a lot about Islam since Ramadan is coming up soon.

Ultimately, Allah (SWT) creates you and every wonderful (and horrible) thing you’ve experienced. Allah (SWT) creates your life.

To bow and to prostrate your Allah (SWT) is an honor. It’s a wonderful thing. And it is your duty to do so.

132,ftlc354,"Egyptian exmuslim here, wanna clear up some misconceptions about the article, given how it sources none of its claims and the author seems to be a hindu nationalist 

&gt;Non-Muslims were levied taxes known as Jizya to force them into submission to Islam

Jizya is a complicated and nuanced topic, and as far as I'm aware, no scholars see it as a way of strong-arming nonmuslims into Islam. For one, it's only incumbent on permanent, male, nonmuslim residents who can pay it without going poor. Hell, some scholars even argued for excluding monks and hermits from it too. 

Jizya also has it's benefits, since paying it exempts you from military service (and some scholars believe you can be exempt from jizya by going to the army). If jizya's purpose is to force nonmuslims to Islam, why exempt them from military service if they pay it? Wouldn't conscripting them add to the pressure and make them convert faster? 

And nonmuslims aren't really discriminated against either, since muslims have to pay taxes specific to them, like the Zakat and Khums. How the muslim and nonmuslim taxes compare to each other does fluctuate depending on the times, and there have been times where one exceeds the other and vice versa. 

There do exist scholars who say that jizya is used to humiliate nonmuslims and as a sign of their submission to the state, I'm not denying that, but to paint a minority opinion as the categorical purpose of jizya is dishonest 

&gt;The word Kafir thus holds to be the most racist and derogatory term ever used in the history of the world.

The word ""kafir"" is about as racist as the word ""heretic,"" so no, doesn't follow. I find it funny how the word kafir can and has been used on Arabs, Europeans, Americans, Indians, you name it, and it's still somehow racist. Fear-mongering isn't appreciated 

&gt;The six principal articles of faith as per Islam are God, His messengers, angels, revealed books, day of resurrection (Kayamat) and destiny. Anyone who doesn’t believe in them or has an alternate system of beliefs is called kafir.

Why is this being written as if it's evident of Muslims being fundamentalists who won't let anyone stray a hair away from ""true Islam""? This is about as inoffensive as saying ""if you don't believe in Christ, the crucifixion, God, or the resurrection, you're not a christian""

If you don't believe in Allah, you're not a muslim. Shocker, isn't it? 

&gt;The word kafir is a pejorative and derogatory term usually used for non-Muslims. It is almost used as abuse by Muslims

Ok, so I want clarify that the meaning and intention behind the word ""kafir"" differs extremely depending on the context, and this article doesn't do it justice. You can largely divide into 3 categories of kafir: a legal kafir, a qur'anic kafir, and a cultural kafir. 

A legal kafir just means ""nonmuslim."" That's it lol. This definition is mostly found in legal documents on Islamic law dictating how muslims should interact with nonmuslims, which of them they can marry, etc, etc. The thing is, in this sense, the word doesn't carry any emotional connotation. It's analogous to a country calling people who are visiting for a while ""immigrants."" Sure, it paints a distinction between citizens and immigrants, but it's for legal purposes and doesn't hold any emotional content. It just means ""nonmuslim."" This is generally the sense in which muslims say the word ""kafir,"" especially in the west. And hell, even then I'd hesitate to say it's that widespread as opposed to just saying ""yeah, he's a nonmuslim."" The word kafir in legal documents can also mean ""heretic."" Though that's used to refer to Muslims with heretical ideas and not nonmuslims

A Quranic kafir is the worst type of kafir. These are the people who would still disbelieve in Islam even if an angel (that they could verify is an angel) came down to them. To give you an example, Qur'anic kafirs are the people who still didn't think Muhammad was a prophet after he split the moon on command. This is the sense the author is referring to when he says kafir. People who have their heads up their asses and hate Islam irrationally. The problem is that hardly anyone uses this sense in a casual setting. Muslims are even discouraged from using the word kafir in that sense, since it carries such a heavy connotation. Imagine if the word ""bitch"" mostly meant a female dog, and someone just came up and said that everyone who ever uses that word means it in the derogatory sense. Doesn't work like that

Culturally, things start to get a bit muddled. Think of it as the default meaning of ""kafir"" and it lies somewhere in between the spectrum of legal and qur'anic kafir. This mostly affects middle-eastern muslims since Islamic revivalism has caused some to be a bit hesitant of using kafir in the legal sense and begin to associate it with the Qur'anic sense. In Saudi, you can obviously guess that they take the word a bit more seriously than usual and calling any nonmuslim a kafir may net you a few cringes. Here in Egypt it depends on the age range. Older people will shy away from it due to history with the Muslim Brotherhood, and the zoomers just see it as the punchline of the joke. However, do note that just because you come from a culture that thinks of ""kafir"" as taboo, that doesn't preclude you from using kafir in any of the other senses. Just ask muslims what they mean when they say ""kafir."" It's not that hard 

^(also don't listen to a hindu nationalist on what muslims mean of all people) 

&gt;While many educated Muslims also want to remove this term from all Islamic texts,

No, no one wants to remove the word from all texts. Anyone who wants to is a heretic, because that would entail they want the Quran to be changed. Anyone who would want to do this isn't ""educated"" by any standards 

&gt;There is another related term used which is known as ‘Takfir’, which means a person falsely claiming to be a Muslim

That's not what takfir means at all lmao. ""Takfir"" is a derivative from a verb that means to declare a muslim a kafir (in the heretic sense). It's an extremely taboo thing and is reserved for people with kooky ideas. Like the mujassima who say that Allah has limbs and appendages. Hell, there's even a term for people who take takfir too far and do it to practicallt everyone, they're called ""takfiris."" See ISIS and the like for examples

The word he means to use is ""munafik,"" and it basically means someone who outwardly claims to be a Muslim and denies Islam secretly. Think closeted exmus 

Sometimes people use the term ‘Kufr’ also which is also similar to ‘kafir’.

It's not really ""similar,"" more a derivative. Kufr is the abstract noun of kafir. It's like ""denial"" and ""denier""

&gt;But others were considered heretic and were called Mushriq, which refers to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, and many other communities and as such they have to be punished by sword and death

Mushrik just means a polytheist, since mushrik literally translates to ""one who associates [others with Allah]""

There's disagreement over whether or not mushriks are eligible for jizya, and even the ones who say they aren't don't outright kill them, they still give them the option to convert to Islam. Obviously not ideal, but the author makes it seem like genocide is the only option for mushriks

&gt;This word is inducing many Muslims to, not integrate themselves with other non-Muslims.

Not really. Hate for non-muslims is so much more complicated than a single word, and like I explained it's dependent on what sense of the word you're using 

&gt;A small child in a Muslim family is trained to not mix with Kafirs. Therefore, those children when they grow up never integrate with other non-Muslim population in a non-Muslim country

This is both hilarious and extremely saddening. That moment when you try to be so liberal and inclusive that you demonize muslims while also giving no source for your nonsensical claims. Bias goes both ways, people

When your arguments are so horrid that even an exmuslim takes offense 

&gt;A small child in a Muslim family is trained to not mix with Kafirs. Therefore, those children when they grow up never integrate with other non-Muslim population in a non-Muslim country

Still no source. And no sane muslim trains their child to keep away from nonmus. This man is describing ISIS 

&gt;Also, a fear of becoming a Mushriq or mixed belief is instilled in them right from childhood.

given how mushrik means polytheist, he'll have to explain how the hell muslims are afraid of becoming polytheists lmao. 

And this all depends on the culture you're in, and even then it's exaggerated. No one takes religion seriously from the younger generation here in Egypt, and Saudi is starting to follow suit

Daily reminder to not listen to Hindu nationalists for topics about Islam anymore than you listen to Kent Hovind for lectures on evolution"
133,fo8o4p0,"&gt;I agree about anti-gay, but anti-abortion is not as strong among Muslims and as for the nuclear family, Muslims accept and widely practice polygamy which is a huge no no for western conservatives. They define 'family' differently.

LOL tell that to the whole state of Utah. Is that the best example you got? Polygamy being the only difference considering that most Western Muslims don't even practice polygamy? Are you really going to argue that the average Muslim family is okay with abortions?  The average Muslim family in the West has **conservative views** and hold on to values that align with both conservatives Christians and Jews.  This shouldn't even be a debate. 

You haven't made any strong points in your comment.  Immigrants/Muslims/Somalis hold conservatives views but know that the right will never cater to them which is why they will never vote for them. If you want to go ahead, but most Somalis won't follow suit.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Cold blunt truth is better than self-deception. Disagree?

Agree. This is why comparing Somali culture to the culture of a primitive extinct species is nothing but a lie. Maybe you should run to the white conservatives and share your self-hate there? They will partially open up their arms to you I'm sure."
134,fpst0na,"i just feel *hurt* after reading this... my heart is pounding i feel sick.

I'm a muslim iranian (long story short: I believe the base elements like god, but I believe hate towards anyone shouldn't be a thing, you can wear whatever the hell you want. I also believe god is really forgiving and loves us all no matter what. Just be a kind person.). I'm also queer. Islam is homophobic(debatable for homophobia) and transphobic inherently. My (muslim)family is also textbook homophobic and transphobic. I would get disowned and abused if I ever came out. But all the other muslims I know. They're the most fucking supportive things in the world. I just got the bad end of the stick in my case.

It makes me fucking sick to read how we get executed by the government in iran for being us. The government is shit. Do you know what we have to do just to be able to love? Some of us have to go through sex change just to live (Believe it or not transgender is allowed!). We have to go under cover , it's a secret. The pressure is excavating. To be found out. That is true. But have you ever been in iranian culture, like actually talk to the people? I love the culture, the dancing, happiness, niceness. I love my people. We have potential.

l feel depressed knowing our wonderful people are oppressed by the government. I really hope one day we can get over with this government and get a loving one that cares about it's people. You can be queer and muslim. It's not rocket science. Just because i'm an iranian doesn't necessarily mean I think all of this hate is okay.  I see potential. Yes, the older generations are still like 95% homophobic, but the younger generations are changing. I'm seeing compassion and acceptance in their eyes. Some of them just need to be educated it on it. I wish people would see us iranians aren't big scary men with beards with no mercy, but people.

I swear, being iranian is one of the most top things I keep secret in my daily life. I remember in middle school, the second I told everybody I'm iranian everybody went cold. Everybody went tense. You could feel it. I even lost friends. It sucks man being iranian in the west. It seems like people only see me as a government. A really shitty one also. I didn't choose to be like this. I feel like prejudices against middle east people and muslim people is something that desperately needs to be addressed. The media also seems to love to portray us as cruel merciless people. There's good and bad everywhere. Be the good."

think this through. Thier book flat out says that:
1) infidels are not people, so lying to them or killing them is not a sin. 
2) that every muslim should kill or conquer the infidel where ever they find them.

137,f1n8yli,"Im just going to throw this out there.

It’s interesting to see the people in these comments lump every religion into one condemnable group. I would argue that it’s because they’ve been told on twitter that criticizing Islam specifically in any way is inherently islamophobic. They want to hate Christianity so badly (because they have been forced to believe that white Christians are the reason for all of the worlds ailments) that they will turn even a story about Islam into an “all religions are evil” sentiment. No, not “all”. Some. Islam is pretty bad guys. I’m not saying everyone who was born into a Muslim family is a bad person, but Islam clearly does not fit in the mold of modern times. It’s a far, far worse belief system than Christianity let’s be honest for once."
138,ekjqn2k,"&gt;The political side that is most against the increased influence of Islam in Western Europe is conservatives themselves, so it's really not fair to simply group them with this issue

And yet, it's the Evangelical Christians in America who do all of the same things you accuse Muslims immigrants of, and say the same shit that you do about Muslims. They don't hate what Muslims are doing, they just hate Muslims for being ""foreign."" They're the same kind of people, worship the same God, and are the same kind of toxic. Only difference is that the Muslim folks are brown."

I'd go live with Jim bakker before I'd consider visiting Saudi Arabia as a woman. 

Progress is not made by excusing their behavior. Even if you could find examples of Christians being killed for refusing to marry a rapist it wouldn't even begin to excuse them. Even if a Muslim family is considered peaceful, the way they abuse women is unforgivable. Giving them permission to travel, drive a car, it is illegal to reveal your HAIR. Even in first world countries women get stuck being forced to wear a hijab even if they hate it, particularly if they're under 18.

The fact that every atheist character has a permanent scowl at all times. The girlfriend breaking up with the main character because he won't stop believing in god. The ""debates"" themselves in the classroom, which are basically Christian TED talks that the writers want you to hear. The definately-not-offensive way a Muslim family is portrayed when they find out their daughter listens to *gasp* Christian podcasts! The part where an old lady with dementia is seemingly possessed by an angel at one point? The way that the FAMILY FROM DUCK DYNASTY PLAYS, ESSENTIALLY, THE MOVIE'S NICK FURY ROLE?

You don’t see the level of bigotry, violence, anti-se metic, homophobic, or racist views from Christianity.  I’m agnostic (so no skin in the game either way) and it’s very obvious due to pew research polls and data, who the problem child is when it comes to hateful intolerance and this trashy little congresswoman is shocking no one with her hateful statements.

They don't all share the same views. There are muslims out there who agree with slavery, the killings of apostates, chastising your wife and those are the ones who I  consider terrible human being, but there are also those who don't believe in all that and who interpret certain verses differently. I can't hate those who hold on to a religion they have been born in, a religion that they were told is the truth since they were toddlers. Islam without muslims would still be Islam, a *religion*. "

Our personal friends, family and anecdotes don't speak for islam and it's violent homophobic nature. If and when these same muslims come under shari'a rule, they'd not oppose it (though some might privately be against it); some would even welcome it.

It's not Islamophobia if I say a truth, Islam never tolerated others religions.

By the way, there is no contempt or hate dripping in my comment. "
150,drcypet,"You ever been to a Muslim household? Never been invited over to Muslim's house for any reason? You don't see the culture. You see them in public. Not in private. They would never want their daughter to marry you unless you converted to Islam, no matter how liberal you think they are. They will literally disown their daughter for trying to date any man. Do you understand the culture that goes around marriage even here in America? 

You don't seem to know much about the culture. You are correct many Muslim women do not wear the hijab. Cool. That is not what i was saying at all. I am not even saying they aren't ""assimilated"" in whatever public sense you mean that in. I am saying you may think a Muslim family is tolerant until you witness their 18 year old daughter not wanting to wear the hijab anymore after being forced into it a younger age.  I don't have a very reductionist and skewed view at all. My girl is an ex-muslim. Her friends are muslims and ex-muslims. I've heard dozens of stories about dozens of their families. The nitty gritty. The actual culture. What goes on at home. Not what they act like in the public limelight in front of Americans. Most are good people, mostly harmless people to the general public. I am not disagreeing with that at all. 

I have the same view of Islam (not Muslims) as Irshad Manji and Majjid Nawaz. Are their views skewed too even though they are Muslims? Have you ever visited the ex-muslim subreddit? Go have a gander at some of their stories. 

I have no issue with individual Muslims. The issue is with Islam. My issue is also with people like you who just defend Islam while knowing very very little about their actual culture and what they believe and and say in private among each other.

I am all for reforming Islam. It needs reformation. actual Muslims who have experienced the actual culture and are in positions to be able to try to be an activist towards a reformation are doing so. Do they have a skewed view? The culture is fucked. Every single ex-muslim will say this. They have been disowned by their families (even in America)

I am not generalizing. I am not saying every single Muslim. My issue lies with Islam and also lies with people who defend it who know nothing about it. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5wclhYcWaA

here is a video between Irshad Manji and Mehdi Hasan. Irshad is an actual liberal progressive muslim looking for reformation so the religion can survive the 21st century. Mehdi is a very strict conservative Muslim who rejects any idea of reformation (just like the overwhelming majority of Muslims) 

If you can take 45 minutes to actually listen to what they disagree on, let me know who you agree with more. 

Just because I am calling for Islam to be reformed does not mean I hate muslims or hate islam or generalize ""all muslims"". My view on Islam is not skewed at all. And if mine is, then you are saying other actual muslims like Irshad and Maajid Nawaz view of Islam is skewed. Which of course would be pretty funny coming from someone like you, who isn't Muslim at all, to call other Muslims view of Islam skewed. 

Your view is reductionist and skewed. Why defend the current state of Islam when there's so many Muslims who are trying to reform it? And so many more around the world who wish they could help, but are too scared to speak up, fearing death for speaking their opinions. You aren't helping them. You aren't helping the women they fight for.  It's better to just not share your opinion at all if you're going to be just like the fundamentalist Muslims completely rejecting any idea that Islam needs to be reformed. Do some real research. "
151,diyxvev,"Ok, I watched it and took some notes as I went.

He starts off talking about genocide denial, which I believe should be legal. I have always thought that the best way to contradict lunatics is to put them on a pedestal and make them debate an expert. I dont believe that they should be charged.

However, threats are entirely different. Most of the second half of his speech centres around Islam. Now, before I talk about this, I want to say something about Islamophobia, which I personally believe *can* be considered racism. Criticism of Islam is not in any way racism, but it is incredibly important how it is done. It is important that the ideology is criticized, but not Muslims themselves. There is a huge number of hate crimes perpetrated against minorities, not even because they are Muslim, but because they are mistaken for being Muslims based on their race. You hear all the time about Sikhs and Hindus are assaulted because of their race or whatever head clothing that they are wearing. That is why it can be considered racism, not because of inherent speech, but resulting action.

Anyways, back to Islam. I do not disagree this is a problem. Radicalization in the Islamic community is by no means a tiny issue, it is something that needs to be tackled, but it need to be tackled intelligently. He mentions the sickening words in the Qu'ran and Bible, I am an atheist and I think they are both horrible. But there is no way that any politician could censor or ban a holy book without a mass revolt. It is just not possible. In order to destroy Islamic extremism, the issue need to be tackled from the source. He actually mentioned Salafism and Wahhabism in his speech, but it is important to note that our good ol ally, KSA, is the main exporter of these ideologies. If the issue is to be solved peacefully, it needs to be destroyed not with divisiveness against one another, but unity against evil institutions.

Im ranting now, point is, I believe that nobody should be arrested for contrasting opinions, no matter how incredulous they are. What I do believe is that threats or hate-incitement should be punished, regardless of the ideology that pushes it."
152,djnbfb2,"&gt; Not wanting even more of them does not mean that you are totally negative about Islam or hate Muslims

Yes but there's also a difference between political islam and islam/moslems.

We don't want Saudi Arabia or Erdogan to fund shit here and we don't want islamic childcare to brainwash young people. The average muslim family is innocent because they never tried to further an agenda but we also have to make sure those don't end up as victims and fall to crap flying around."
153,dj1tlfs,"Islamic doctrine does not state that homosexuality should be punished. The prevalent view among orthodox Muslims is ""hate the sin, not the sinner;"" in other words, homosexual sex is immoral, homosexual attraction is not. This is obviously a view that is damaging to queer people, but again, it's hardly uniquely bad or much different than any other major religion.

I'm practicingish. I fast during Ramadan, I abstain from pork, alcohol, the like, and I interact with Muslims all the time. The only reason I said ""from a Muslim family"" is because my personal belief in God has drifted towards agnosticism in recent months. Before that though, I had no issues reconciling my progressive views with religion; in fact, I knew many like-minded practicing Muslims. Islam is not a monolith. There's a wealth of view points, interpretations, and approaches to the faith."
154,di1mi59,"Well you're reading too much into it, it wasnt a mock or anything. Please dont get offended or anything, Im just trying to start an intellectual conversation. One thing I've learned as a gay Asian man coming from a Muslim family is just not to get hurt by words because I myself have received so much ''mocks'' from all backgrounds that I belong to because of my other background. So, dont take it personally and if you can't take a simple 7 letters honost question and assume thats a dickish way of mocking , just stop, well you do you boo.

I believe the concept of transgender. Biological male feeling they're female and the other way around. What I could not understand is when Tumblr SJW thinks there are more than 70+ genders, some being Aesthetgender, Anesigender, Cadensgender, that it borders on ridicule.

My real question;

There has been a consensus here among the gay men that these SJW ''trans'' who havent/dont put much effort into trasitioning that are also posting videos on youtube about gender identity , trans etc etc, are making the LGBTQ + community(s image) as a whole a joke.

I personally am pro for anything that brings positivity to our community, but a lot of my opinions are similar to Blaire White.

Do I agree to the 76 genders myself as a gay man? No. But do I support any LGBTQ+ movement that benefits us all, Yes. So again, dont take my opinion as a ''hate statement''. You might have a different perspective because I dont experience gender disphoria or transitioning. Why arent ''male'' and ''female'' enough to classify the identity they represent? 

So change my mind, why should I support these queers when they've been making bad impression on the internet making senseless videos on youtube? Some of them being the Riley making a video about how straight cis men should just ignore transgender status she has and date them regardless, else theyre transphobic.

Thoughts?

155,frf419i,"I think you should hold a private function for some friends who don't judge etc and have dancing and alcohol if that's what you want but wedding will have to be a typical ahmadi wedding. Usually what I see in such cases is that the the couple holds a private mehndi function to have fun but make sure they don't invite anyone who snitches on them.  

I have attended so many non ahmadi weddings in Pakistan and the west and honestly ,they are better than ahmadi weddings by all counts. If a Muslim family is conservative, then they hold it in their style. However, the more liberal families have dances, music etc and anyone there who wants to do Purdah just sit on the side with abaya or hijab and enjoy the function while maintaining Purdah. That is is way more inclusive than any Ahmadi wedding I have attended where half of the time you are scared about being kicked out for some stupid reason and it ruins the whole wedding if you do get snitched upon. 

I have seen whole ahmadi weddings turn out into family feuds because they did something in the wedding that did not align with the jamaats policies and that to me, is more awful than not maintaining Purdah etc. A wedding is supposed to be a religious and cultural celebration for the couple, not some political ground for jamaat to debate upon. You cannot eliminate cultural aspects to weddings like certain rasms e.g doodh pilai etc. Pretty sure non Pakistani Ahmadis have their own cultural aspects and customs and you can't tell them to not carry them out. It's unfair and not inclusive at all. 

Any excessive spending however, is one aspect that I think should be frowned upon by jamaat which it isn't ironically. I know rich ahmadi people who held weddings which had 10 courses for lunch or dinner and jamaat officials don't say a thing which is very hypocritical but then the problem is that if you eliminate music, dances, rasms etc then, the only thing people have left to spend on is food and decorations."

He also belongs to a rich powerful background so in his culture, it is a given the son of this high class family HAS to get married  and not just get married to anyone, only the the best out there. It is a lot of pressure. Any other guy would be lucky to be in his position but oh how the universe tests people in different ways, since he’s gay that not something that he is exited about. Every day his traditional muslim family is telling him about more and more families interested in seeing and meeting him.

Dont get me wrong. During his early 20s, he too believed going to a western country ( he’s in canada 🇨🇦) would allow him to become free, people would be more accepting of him, get to make a life of his own, indulge in freedoms he always dreamed of, get a great job and become independent. 

Sadly that did not exactly turn out the way he had planned. He faced a lot of rejection here from the very people he had hoped would help him achieve a free independent life he had dreamed of. He had been rejected countless times from dream jobs he wanted, felt difference in the way white people interacted with him due to his name/appearance/background/accent etc. Thats why I said, being an immigrant bring its own set of challenges. The fantasy life had had dreamed of just seemed like an illusion. 
So this is why he feels even more conflicted. The people he had looked up to in a foreign country did not allow him to grow or gave opportunities for him to prosper but at least he has family back home that truly love him even though lgbt/sexuality is just an alien concept to them."
158,exian9s,"Netflix’ Elite really baited me. It’s a Spanish Netflix show about three students from a poor village attending an elite school and dealing with rich people. The trailer showed one of the poor kids being a Muslima in a hijab and I was like hell yeah. Then I watched the show: she was the best student in every one of her classes and the mean girl was being mean to her because of that, she wouldn’t engage in all that white people nonsense. Then I kept on watching: she falls in love with the white boy, her brother is gay (not that there’s anything wrong with that) and so oppressed and also dealt drugs, she was forced to take off her hijab in school because the mean girl complained to the principal and after that she rarely wears a hijab (which you know if she doesn’t want to do you shouldn’t force her but the character completely changed). Her storyline ended with the narrative forcing the audience to feel bad about her but also totally appreciating and respecting the white boy because her father told him that he would forbid her going to the school if the white boy talked to her again and he respects her fathers unreasonable request like the hero he is. Anyway that show is garbage and I still want to see season 2 because I am garbage. Another thing that irked me the wrong way about this show is that the Muslim family is from Palestine. Not that I’m against Palestine but rather that they never addressed her Palestinian identity and it felt more like they didn’t want to make the family Moroccan. The biggest group of immigrants from a Muslim country to Spain comes from Morocco and Morocco used to be occupied by Spain.

Upside is they were free to pursue a career with the social safety nets of not having to worry about costs of living like rent and food since the culture does not allow for the financial abandonment of women by their fathers, husbands, or brothers.

Basically they never had to worry about going broke or any stigma associated with it. While the men are deeply shamed for not making it financially since it's the role of men to provide for women and children."
160,fsuzhnb,"Hmmm and about that farid guy i wanted to add he looks smart but he looks some oversmart too lol i was going to edit but then i saw u already commented anyways so here i told u about him even its not important 😅😂 he is youtube idk if u know him his channel name is farid responds or fareed responds i dont remember correctly and i am lazy to check

Anyways leaving this all on the side i want to say thank u for ur precious time and messages i really want things to be simple so what should i believe this muhammad made this religion for getting benefits?

And u also keep it short i dont want u to get tired by typing that long msgs from now before it was fine but now i dont want u to get tired so yeah just keep it simple and easy i am very agitated these days so the more things are simple the more i like it

And i also had this question what if someone is born in other religion what's his fault and then how u hear its their decision when u been told he reject why he reject and even if nobody got the msg on the day of judgement u will be tested and if u will be passed u will go to heaven if not u will go to hell there is a hadith about this maybe as u will be asked to jump in fire and whoever will listen will go heaven and who doesn't hell i guess it was something like this i can be wrong too but i guess it was like this

Then how dr zakir once was telling i guess someone asked him this question that time and he was telling these people are not born in muslim families and still the choosed islam those were scholars or speakers or dawah people whatever it is called and mostly maybe he was saying are not born in Muslim families i dont remember the things but maybe he was trying to say this not born in muslim family is useless excuse lol and there is a hadith too every child fitrah idk what words it was but something probably that are born Muslims then their makes them jews or christians it was something like this maybe

So dr zakir did lol on this thing which u just said 😅😂😂😂 i personally also use to think like this but then these islamic answers pfff

Anyways so deedat brother can u last time just answer me about what i should believe about this muhammad? Thank u"

Other than that, I don't know what to tell you. Are you trying to argue that the social expectations towards muslim men are not different from social expectations towards muslim women? That a typical muslim family is not centered around a dominant male? That these trends are not significant enough? That it is bigoted (or ""lazy stereotyping"") in some way to acknowledge these trends?

164,ftntcnc,"Mashallah i always think about this! Although slavery is permissible it is more encouraged to buy a person's freedom.

13th Hadith Translation
Abu Hamzah Anas bin Malik (R.A.), who was the servant of the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W.) reported that the Prophet (S.A.W.), said: 
""None of you truly believes (in Allah and in His religion) until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself"" [Bukhari: 13 &amp; Muslim: 45 (a)]

Brief Narration
The Hadith lays down a very significant principle of behavior of Muslims with each other. A true Islamic community is when it is built upon love and compassion for its members. Every member should care for and help one another. They should treat others in ways they want to be treated.

Based on this logic. If i met slave i would want him to have freedom because i also love freedom. We should also remember that many early muslims were slaves"
165,ft2d5ja,"Sure, I have a lot of Muslim friends who drink, eat pork, don’t wear a hijab etc. But if they’re in contact with their families and “devout” (quotation marks because devotion to your religion is no excuse for intolerance) enough that marrying a Muslim with non-Muslim family is a big deal, then I doubt they’re the kind of Muslim we know. It’s a certain level of religious behaviour that would be simply incompatible with a couple living together before marriage - although maybe they’ve gotten a quick nikkah to make it legitimate"

Cmon.

OKAY, but just like you accuse muslims of being oppressive for their dress code. You’re doing the same.

Just because its not normal TO YOU. That means others cant do it?

Tolerant in what way? Bu forging them to dress up?

Nono. the NUDISTS are the ones being persecuted. Not the other way around. Nudists Have ZERO power so it wouldn’t even be within their possibility to persecute me or anyone who wears clothing.

168,fej9j6w,"&gt;When you are a kid you are told in hell you will be hanged with you hair while on fire if you don't wear hijab.

Well sorry about where you lived but not every muslim family is like that. There are fanatics in every religion/society. 

Hijab is oppression only if it is mandatory. Again it may blow your mind but plenty of women wears it because of their belief and not because someone forced them to wear. I know  personally many women who started to wear it before any of their parents or relatives told them to."
169,f29an4b,"Hijab-wearing should be something that the wearer herself wants to do though. As a ""deed"", it doesnt count if the wearer doesnt actually want to wear it (which is why my mum has never forced me to wear hijab). But i guess it depends on how strict a muslim family is."
170,evtr2gm,"You said that the hijab is objectively a misogynistic thing. So I think that you automatically assume that there isn't any Muslim woman proud of her culture who wears it by her choice (there are). Therefore I'm assuming that you assume that every Muslim family is living a situation of violence and coercion dictated by their religion and that every Muslim man is a violent husband that forces the hijab (which is not true, domestic violence exists in Christian and atheist families too). It is true that in many Muslim countries there are a lot of issues regarding women's rights, but ""to tar everybody with the same brush"" is what makes you a racist, in my opinion."

The ignorance of young white liberals towards other religions is astounding. Your sister is going to learn a very rough lesson. 99% sure she's being used because being with a white woman for a Muslim family is like your son dating a prostitute.

175,e8778x8,"&gt;The Oxford grooming ring was promoted by imams who encourage followers to think white women deserve to be “punished”, an Islamic leader has claimed. Dr Taj Hargey, imam of the Oxford Islamic Congregation, said race and religion were inextricably linked to the recent spate of grooming rings in which Muslim men have targeted under-age white girls.

&gt;Earlier this week seven members of a child sex ring from Oxford were found guilty of forcing under age girls to commit acts of ""extreme depravity"". Their victims, aged between 11 and 15, were groomed and plied with alcohol and drugs before being sexually assaulted and forced into prostitution. They targeted ""out of control"" teenagers.

&gt;Dr Hargey said that the case brought shame on the city and the community and is a set back for cross community harmony. But worse still is the refusal to face up to its realities, he wrote in the Daily Mail.

&gt;The activities of the Oxford sex ring are “bound up with religion and race” because all the men - though of different nationalities - were Muslim and they “deliberately targeted vulnerable white girls, whom they appeared to regard as 'easy meat', to use one of their revealing, racist phrases”, Dr Hargey said. That attitude has been promoted by religious leaders, he believes. “On one level, most imams in the UK are simply using their puritanical sermons to promote the wearing of the hijab and even the burka among their female adherents. But the dire result can be the brutish misogyny we see in the Oxford sex ring.”

&gt;People tiptoe around the issues and refuse to discuss the problems exposed by the scandals such as those “from Rochdale to Oxford, and Telford to Derby”, he wrote.

&gt;In all cases the perpetrators were Muslim men and the victims were under age white girls. To pretend it is not a problem is the Islamic community is “ideological denial”, Dr Hargey said.

&gt;“But then part of the reason this scandal happened at all is precisely because of such politically correct thinking. All the agencies of the state, including the police, the social services and the care system, seemed eager to ignore the sickening exploitation that was happening before their eyes.

&gt;“Terrified of accusations of racism, desperate not to undermine the official creed of cultural diversity, they took no action against obvious abuse.”

&gt;The men were allowed, he said, to come and go from care homes by the authorities, and if the situation had been reversed with gangs of white men preying on Muslim teenagers ”the state's agencies would have acted with greater alacrity.”

&gt;True Islam preaches respect for women but in mosques across the country a different doctrine is preached - “one that denigrates all women, but treats whites with particular contempt,” the Imam said. The men are taught that women are “second-class citizens, little more than chattels or possessions over whom they have absolute authority,"" he claims in the column.

&gt;“The view of some Islamic preachers towards white women can be appalling. They encourage their followers to believe that these women are habitually promiscuous, decadent, and sleazy — sins which are made all the worse by the fact that they are kaffurs or non-believers.

&gt;“Their dress code, from miniskirts to sleeveless tops, is deemed to reflect their impure and immoral outlook. According to this mentality, these white women deserve to be punished for their behaviour by being exploited and degraded.”

&gt;Such cases can only be prevented in the future if Britain abandons the blinkers of political correctness, he concludes."

It may seem like they don't do much now, but as they attend their weekly brainwashing sessions, they will change. Unlike other religious groups, Islamic community is very VERY good at brainwashing with their false sincerity and pretentous brotherhood stuff. If they have converted to islam, it means they are failing to find meaning and acceptance in their life, which means they will be attracted more and more as they spend time with them. They are going to change. I am sorry to say this but they may be lost cause and there isnt much you can do about it since they think they are adults who are capable of having sensible decisions, but obviously they are under a delusion.

177,e8fbqhg,"&gt; To some people wearing makeup and high heels are forms of submission and gender in equality. So it’s subjective what is and isn’t considered submissive.

Why do you even bring this up? No one is forced to wear makeup.

&gt; So my cousin wears a hijab and is a teacher. How is she extreme in her religion when all she does is wear a cloth on her head.

Your cousin has to teach things that are in contradiction with her religion. Her job requires her to betray her God. Can we be certain that she will do it? Christians do it all the time, but that's because Christianity is a mere shell of what it's supposed to be. According to the Bible, Christians should pretty much be the same as Muslims. Christianity was forced to change because it was incompatible with society and that's why we have the pick-and-choose religion that we have today. The head scarf itself is not the problem; the problem is the reason for wearing it. If a simple head scarf is so important, imagine how important it is to not teach things that go against Islam.

&gt; Also how would you enforce the ban would you force her to take off her head scarf and fire her?

Yes. If you're willing to lose your job over something like a head scarf or a cross, you deserve to lose your job. Allah is great, apparently. I'm sure he can understand that she has to put her religion aside for eight hours on weekdays.

&gt; The members of my family who do wear a head scarf were not pressured in anyway.

How lucky you are to be so privileged. You're putting your head in the sand if you think that every Muslim family is like yours. Also, when talking about pressure from family, it doesn't necessarily mean pressure from the parents. The parents themselves can feel the pressure as well; pressure from the extended family, pressure from the family from the country of origin. The head scarf is such a powerful symbol in Islam that it can alienate family members from each other.

&gt; Would a Sikh guy have to stop wearing a turban as well?

Yes, all religious symbols (including the cross) should be banned from public functions because they represent beliefs that are incompatible with our society. If you think they are compatible, it's because you're not truly faithful to your religion and you're just pick-and-choosing what to follow and what to ignore in order to suit yourself. The U.S. is a prime example of what happens when you don't take separation of Church and State seriously enough.

People can be compelled to wear makeup by societal pressures. In fact women are compelled to wear all sorts of clothing by cultural forces throughout history.

Your putting your head in the sand thinking that every muslim woman is forced. Theres room for nuance you know. Theres external pressures on women to wear all sorts of clothing should we ban them too? People are forced to do all sorts of things dosent mean they should be banned.

184,ds8lkm0,"I'm in the US for reference, it might be different in other countries.

I had a friend in high school who was a Kurdish Muslim, and she hid her relationship from her parents. However one of my ex friends who happens to be also Bangladeshi was dating a Pakistani guy. IIRC her parents did know, and he was Muslim as well. But I believe her parents were in a ""love marriage"" as in they chose each other. 

I think it depends on how influenced they are with religion and how much they adhere to the norms and cultural values. Neither my mother or I wear the hijab. However my mother does pray 5 times a day and fasts. Her sister (my aunt) on the other hand does wear the hijab and also lives in Saudi Arabia and is married to someone who strongly adheres to the rules. My aunt was more religious than my mom or uncle before she married.

I think it's also important to identify if a Muslim family is changing with the times. Like one of the rules of Islam is that you can't have interest, this means you can't be charged interest or charge interest. It's why there are some that don't own homes because traditional banks and mortgages hold interest. Majority of Muslims don't adhere to those rules, or the ones I've interacted with as they all own home and are tied to Western banks. And I myself don't adhere to it as I use a Western bank.

Also how strongly they have to cultural ties is important too. I have a Indian friend, who is not Muslim but pretty much a lesbian (I say pretty much because she's only been with girls, and does not have any feelings for guys despite never being with one). However she will be getting an arranged marriage and has accepted that. For her, she feels like she would bring shame to her family if she ended up in a same sex relationship and would dishonor her parents by not accepting an arranged marriage. I have tried to talk her out of it because it'd be really hard for when she does get married if she has no attraction to men.

So while religion does play a role, I think family and cultural values play a larger role. What your community and family thinks of you, I think is the rope that pulls people into doing things that they wouldn't otherwise do."
185,dr1f624,"You apologise for assuming but then went on to assume some more. Thats pretty irritating dude bro :/.

First thing you gotta know is not every Muslim family is as awful as the people seen on this sub. So assuming I or My family act that way is very insulting .  

Yes, many non Muslims are wonderful ppl. Many of them are My friends as well. As for who goes to Hell or nah: Muslims aren't guaranteed to not go to hell. They may not be there forever Idk it's up to Allah but if they lead bad lives they can totally go there.  

I leave the judgement of who shud go to hell or not up to Allah swt.  

Ok your next point ""Muslims to other Muslims...homosexual and have to hide the fact"" couple things here. Banishing People from your family is haram. People who do that do so because of culture. It happens in every major abrahamic faith. Ecuador is about half the size of Ontario yet has 200 gay ""conversion therapy"" clinics where LGBT ppl are just beaten until they claim theyre straight. I'm not denying its a problem when Muslims do it, just pointing out its not exclusive to Muslims.  

Its just as disappointing no matter who does it. As a Muslim, I cannot condone the act of homosexuality. That doesn't mean I become homophobic. Ever heard the phrase love the sinner not the sin? I don't mean to play that card but I do actually have several LGBT friends. A person's sexuality is not the whole of who they are.  

Same applies to belief in general. I have family that are non Muslim. Half my moms side is JW. Half my dad's is xtian. I have family that are possibly ex Muslim (hes a bit vague about it Idk he might be ahmadian he used to be Muslim and then Christian so the mystery continues. ) in any case, I also have family that went from jw to Muslim back to jw. THEY are all still loved. Still get together for them family reunions. Still sit at the same table for thanksgiving.  
No one banished anyone and no one had to hide their religion.  

Allah says in the Qur'an, ""let there be no compulsion in religion"" So people SHOULD be able to leave freely if they choose.

And here's where you get really presumptuous. ""If you have a son whose gay so he fears for his life"" pause. I live in a major Canadian city. Why the hell would he fear for his life? Theres the assumption.

Do you think All Muslims come from the middle East and believe in killing or something? Your other questions on my hypothetical sons sexuality are therefore irrelevant because he wouldnt need to fear being killed here.  

Next: a persons sexuality is a very small part of who they are.  
But I'm guessing you really wanted to know how I'd react to havibg a gay child? I wouldn't be the most thrilled I've ever been. I wouldnt love My child less. I sure as heck wouldnt kill or harm him. I'd let him know there's no haram relations allowed in my house but assuming he's an adult (because kids shudnt be having sex at any age imo, std, age of technology, revenge porn) what he does outside my house is not my buisness. Thats between him and Allah.  


""Your best friend comes out as ex Muslim"" ok again with the whole assumption thing dude. All this banishment crap? Where the h ell would they even be banished to? Alberta? No. FYI I HAVE had a friend come out as ex Muslim. Didn't matter. Thats between him and Allah. I can try to advise or answer questions like yiurs if he has them and I can make dua but I can't force him to be Muslims and I wouldn't want to banish anyone. To be clear: I DO NOT BELIEVE SHUNNING PEOPLE FOR LEAVIBG ISLAM IS OK. it's a piss-poor way to invite someone back to the religion if thats my goal.

""What if your daughter didn't wanna wear human"" cool beans. Many women in my family who ARE Muslim don't wear it. Life goes on. Faith is in the heart. Not on the head. 

""She feels it's restrictive and objectifying"" my child would be given the facts on why we wear it and I hope she would choose it but she would need to CHOOSE IT. i wear hijab and live life to the fullest. I dont need to take it off to be happy. I wouldnt feel like a failure of a parent. I'd just recignize my child was at a diff place if faith than I am.  

""You'd be a better person all around of you let ppl be who they are without consequences"".
Who says I don't? Like you have No idea who I am or anything about me and you just assume I don't already do this? Please don't do that. Stop assuming.  
  
I am a human. I don't have the power or right to stop ppl from doing these things so pls stop assuming. 
""If the answer is no, why not""

Thats the only non presumptuous question you asked -.-

186,dldv47w,"Wouldn't an apples to apples comparison be to compare the most religious subset of American Muslims to evangelicals, not all Muslims to the most religious Christian subset? It's highly misleading, but makes a great headline to push a narrative.

My current gf is Pakistani Muslim. Her brother came out gay and the entirety of her self proclaimed moderate family exiled him. They are also incredibly racist against me and are threatening the same to my gf and trying to force me to convert, even though it is no expressly forbidden in the Quran for a Muslim woman to marry a Christian man, most Muslims choose to be mysoginist and control their women. Once again this Muslim family is self proclaimed moderates, don't go to mosque often, and about half the women don't wear hijab. Yet they are homophobic and racist. Sure there are some American Muslims who might not have a problem with either, but in my experience they are all Persians who fled Iran with the shah and were wealthy and not religious at all to begin with."
187,dly9hqb,"&gt;Except you still do.While some parents do force it on their daughters, most don't.

Really? You know what the penalty for apostasy is in Islam right? A girl refusing to don the hijab in a conservative Muslim family is basically disgracing her family and faces severe repercussions. 

&gt;But that could be said about a lot of things and regardless of religion. Some parents police their children.

People police their children, but their is something qualitatively different between choosing between tshirts dresses and skirts versus hijab and niqab. 

&gt;My father threw a fit when I got my ears and septum pierced. He complained about the clothes I wore. He's the epitome of sexism and he follows a patriarchal religion. In the end, I still wore what I wore because it's my choice.

If you think a hijab and pierced ears is comparable, you are woefully mistaken. One sets you apart from larger Western society, the other doesn't. "
188,dlya1vh,"&gt;and your assertion is supported by what?

By actually being from that culture? I dunno personal experience? 

&gt;I feel like you've never actually met a Muslim woman, much less a hijabi.

I feel like you are a woefully naive individual who has never been outside Canada, let alone to a majority Muslim country. I'm Pakistani, so I think I would know about this stuff than you. 

&gt;
Not every Muslim family is conservative (also yes, conservatives aren't liberal, just like how liberals aren't conservative). just like anybody, Muslims fall anywhere along the political spectrum. I've met some hella liberal Muslims and some very conservative ones too. it's ignorant to assume all 1.6 billion Muslims hold the same beliefs.

Ah the generalizing argument. I am sure liberal Muslims aren't pushing the hijab on their kid. But the majority of Conservative Muslims do and are. "

The Israeli government does everything it can do oppress Christian and Muslim religious expression and they desecrate non-Jewish religious sites. Your perception is the exact opposite of reality.

The Israelis only respect the rights of Jewish women and gays. When you’re being oppressed for existing as a non-Jew other considerations are secondary. 

The Israeli authorities use knowledge of a person being gay as a weapon to get them to become informants by threatening to expose them to their families during  communities. Explain to me how this is tolerance. "

Of course, it's not possible to know exactly how much of the Islamic community is ultra-patriarchical and the idea that all muslims are like this is propagated in working-class areas to foment racial tensions.  Regardless, racial tensions do exist in working-class communities, even Labour voting communities.

Wambam, a thread with 16 different posters that didn't devolve into violent rhetoric. 

Also, I just spent a few hours on Cockatrice (a client for online Magic the Gathering games), and didn't see any sort of ""violent rhetoric,"" and I can assure you there are at least a few incels on there. 

&gt;I know. You're trying to distract from that point with a strawman of what I actually said.

I don't really understand how criticizing the base point by looking at the logic is a strawman.

&gt;The incel community is associated with violent rhetoric and misogyny. True? Yes. ""Incels"" as a community are defined by doing hateful things, so I wouldn't have an issue with his/her comment even if it is meant to be taken that way.

And I disagree. I say that being an incel has nothing to do with being hateful. Being hateful has everything to do with being hateful. 

&gt;It is associated with these things because every single time a large group of incels gather, they participate in this rhetoric, which also consists of calling out those who fail to adhere to the definition of ""truecels"" and dismissing ""fakecels"" and ""volcels.""

Have you followed up on every single gathering of incels? What about when they didn't ""advertise"" themselves as incels? Absolutes like ""every"" and ""all"" are extremely hard to prove. 

&gt;Therefore, incels are defined - by their own intentional actions and beliefs - by violent rhetoric and misogyny.

/r/braincels and incels.me maybe, but even then incels are not a hivemind.

&gt;On the basis of these observations, yes, it is entirely possible to observe a general pattern of hatred, violence and misogyny among inceldom. 

You can observe that 100% of a group has a characteristic, but even that doesn't mean that to be in that group you *have* to have that characteristic.

&gt;To the extent that there is a not insignificant chance that, given a random selection of incels, the overwhelming majority of them will adhere to these principles of violence and misogyny.

And the edgelords say the exact same thing about black people in America.

In fact, all of your ideas and theories you posit are the same that racists and islamaphobes use. They look to statistics to show a greater number of homicides/sexual assault/whatever, and use that to ""prove"" that their discrimination is valid. 

I can even use your five points, verbatim, as evidence that islamaphobia is correct.

1. The Islamic community is associated with violent rhetoric and misogyny. True? Yes.

2. It is associated with these things because every single time a large group of incels gather, they participate in this rhetoric, which also consists of calling out those who fail to adhere to the definition of ""faithful"" and dismissing ""infidels"".

3. From this we can conclude that incels themselves have defined their community, not based on religion (as they reject the very idea of non-devout muslims a priori), but on dominion, as well as an adherence to generalized principles of hatred and sometimes violence against women.

4. Therefore, muslims are defined - by their own intentional actions and beliefs - by violent rhetoric and misogyny.

5. On the basis of these observations, yes, it is entirely possible to observe a general pattern of hatred, violence and misogyny among muslims. To the extent that there is a not insignificant chance that, given a random selection of muslims, the overwhelming majority of them will adhere to these principles of violence and misogyny.

And guess what, most of those things I just said about muslims are straight up factually incorrect. Just like what you say about incels is incorrect."
193,fz1utbe,"It doesn't matter, basically no Muslim family is gonna even arrange a marriage like that based on it now. It doesn't matter if it's allowed, you can see Muslim Hindu couples too, not because it's allowed or anything.

&gt;True but nowhere in any Hindu text is that written. It is a social problem, not a religious one.

Caste is a cultural problem more. But what about religious marriages now?

&gt;Could be. Punjab and Haryana are very patriarchal. But Sikhs are protective of their women in the UK where Pakistani target them. You won't see any Sikh raving about Hindus doing that, either in Punjab or the UK. Interfaith marriage between Hindus and Sikhs are common in Punjab.

Dude, I think they are the same even here. I really doubt about the inter religious marriage thing between these Indian communities.

194,dyxdv7h,"&gt;given your ethnicity = culture point you are clearly insane

We are talking ideology here not culture. I was talking to you a couple hours ago about developing a national ideology that can replace all the religions and bring everyone together. Ethnicity = culture if you allow it, it doesn't have to be that way we can assimilate many of the good ones we have over with a new national ideology. Bad ones just deport them, they aren't worth the effort. You also seem to be under the impression our Islamic community is diverse, its really not. The vast majority come from a handful of regions in Bangladesh and Pakistan.


&gt;Nice conspiracy theories and denial of reality, though.

What conspiracy theories? i have been the one talking about government report while you talk personal anecdotes.

&gt;You are going to have a horrible decade or two coming up. And I will laugh.

197,dk5uxhw,"I think the Islamic community is cancerous, it consists of people who follow so-called corrupt leaders like sheep because they don't think for themselves. That's what causes the epidemic of Muslims believing things that aren't true just because a bearded man told them so.

198,fyqzjux,"I would have to go with ""telling it as it is"". He is certainly not pulling his punches, but I would rather have a brutally frank *discussion* about rape, then see someone be raped/be raped myself.

Which part of his quote is actually objectionable? That Muslim immigrants into Europe commit acts of sexual violence (particularly against white females) at shocking rates much higher than the average? That's simply a statistical fact. Indeed, it seems to be a problem *specific* to Muslim men. In the UK we have these grooming gang scandals, and it's not gangs of white men, or Chinese men, or Sikh men. It's a specific problem within the Islamic community.

Is it controversial to say there are elements in the left prepared to let women be raped? Again, it seems like a simple statement of fact. If you are ""pro-immigration"" in the face of the crime statistics, the *only* possible conclusion is that you consider it to be acceptable collateral damage. There's no way to square this circle and be on the side of both at the same time.

Is it controversial to say there are people willing to be raped themselves? Same as the above; if you are a white female and are pro-immigration, then you are accepting this risk. You are demonstrably willing to ""take one for the team"".

199,fit6w9w,"Both sides are indeed at fault. Violence is more from one side and we all know which side Shahrukh belonged to, which side killed Ankit Sharma IB officer, which side killed Constable Ratan and so on.

It all started by Muslims trying to implement the Shahin Bagh model in Jaffrabad and Chand Bagh to attract attention to western media during Trump's visit. The problem with Islamic community is that the clerics have too much power and decisions and news given by the Mualanas are implemented in 100 percent unity."
200,fk6b0i0,"The only reason you were ever Christian to begin with was because you were unfairly conditioned to be one before you were old enough to think for yourself.

You had your parents, probably their parents, your other relatives, your neighbours, your friends' parents, the people at your church and the guy standing up at the podium who all the adults deferred to conditioning your malleable child brain to believe in a specific narrative about reality.

You looked around and because the culture you grew up in was heavily influenced by Christianity, you saw little reason to ever ask questions.

You were taught to fear and avoid ""deviant"" thinking and to always obey and accept what you were told was true.

You had no chance.  And yet, you've managed to break the surface of the dark, tepid waters of your past and are taking your first desperate breaths of fresh, clean air.  Well done!  Not an easy feat to overcome all that brainwashing and habit.

Now, if you hold on to lingering doubts, it's only because you were raised Christian in a Christian culture.  Stop and think about how you have *no* doubts about the existence of Zeus or Osiris or Vishnu.  Recognize how you're absolutely unworried that you soul might not get accepted into Valhalla to feast and fight with your ancestors and the very gods themselves.  You aren't concerned about how your karmic balance will affect what you reincarnate as in your next life.  Silly ideas, right?

You don't have doubts because Christianity seems *more likely to be true* than Zoroastrianism or the ancient Aztec religion.  You don't, because there is literally no more evidence of Christianity's Truth than that of other faiths (unless you count number of believers, which you shouldn't).  

You only have doubts because Christianity is **familiar to you.**  It has been a part of your life since before you could form lasting memories.  Even I, as someone raised by non-religious parents, default to wondering first about the Christian Heaven and Hell when I think about death because I grew up in Canada, where Christianity is common.  It was the first religion I was exposed to.  

I've never been Christian even for one second - wasn't even baptized (nor was my mother), but Christianity is *still* the ""default religious alternative"" to rational thought just because I grew up around Christians.  

But that doesn't make it more or less correct than Islam.  An atheist in an Islamic community is going to have doubts about what they were taught - not about what you were.  A questioning member of an uncontacted tribe in the Amazon is going to worry about ""what if"" whatever they were taught to believe is actually true after all.  They will spare no thought for Heaven or Hell or Jesus because they've never heard of those things, and neither had tens of thousands of years' worth of their ancestors.

So have no fear and look forward.  Ask questions.  Read and learn.  Not only books on science and secular thinking, but also on religion.  

*Especially* religion.  Study other faiths so you can learn to recognize the patterns that almost all of them share.  To recognize the often-shared narratives that pop up time and time again.  

Study the history of religions so you can learn facts like how Yahweh, the ""model"" for the Abrahamic God, was originally [only one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh) of many Canaanite gods worshiped by ancient Israelites and changed in role and description over time.  You'll begin to see how it all ties together and perceive the logical paths that various religions have taken over the centuries.  How it's all man-made will eventually become obvious and you'll never be able to unsee it.

Study the methods used to convert people over to a new religion so you can grasp why exactly so many people are religious.  You'll see that it has nothing to do with the likelihood of a religion's Truth, but rather the resourcefulness and tenacity of the people doing the converting.  Christian missionaries, for example, were extensively trained in rhetoric and debate and memorized lists of retorts to common questions before they ever went off to visit the heathens.  Common people were overwhelmed by them and enticed by the promises of reward that awaited as repayment for their suffering.

In other places and times, people were threatened with violence or other punishments for not accepting a new religion.  Islam spread across the Middle East and North Africa (and even Spain!) by the sword.  Catholic inquisitions rooted out heresy and punished disbelievers to control the people.  The military leader of Japan even made Japan's converted Christians ""un-convert"" (only partially successful) back to Shinto-Buddhism upon pain of death for refusing.

Religion spreads because of tricks, threats and the slow creep of complacency borne out of traditions.

Anyway, good luck!  The rest of your life is ahead of you and now you're on your way to living it more assertively.  Have no regrets."
201,fj6ihft,"I'm so sorry. 

She was in a terrible situation to begin with but I can't help but feel she should have had more foresight. She was with you for quite a while but it seems she was avoiding making a serious choice about her future (and yours together) until she was absolutely forced to. I sympathize with wanting to avoid it, but it's her responsibility to learn how to deal with it instead of suppressing everything until shit hits the fan. She was living in limbo, breaking all the rules and expectations she was raised with but not wanting to face to consequences. She knew deep down that her family would never accept your relationship and that being public with you would mean letting go of them. But she probably didn't want to face it because she was afraid. So much was and is on the line. But she knows her family. What her brother did to her was awful but I wonder if it was entirely left field for her. Honor violence is very common in these situations. It makes me wonder if deep down she knew this would happen and it would vindicate her original position because now she gets to say, See? I told you so. To justify her cowardice in not wanting to fully commit one way or another. 

This sounds apalling, I know, but growing up in that kind of family and culture and living a double life can really fuck you up and make it hard to be honest with yourself. She needs therapy. I know you say that she sometimes practices a little bit but she might still consider reaching out to the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain for resources and help finding a culturally competent professional as she transitions into a public life divorced of her family's expectations. They also have extensive hands on experience with dealing with law enforcement and legal intervention in situations of this sort and can give you both better advice than you can get on Reddit. I will say perhaps prepare yourself for the prospect that justice may be hard to get. From what I've heard from activists on your side of the pond, it's notoriously for difficult for a woman from a Muslim background in the UK to take legal action against male relatives for honor/domestic violence. But CEMB will know more about that than I do. 

I empathize with her, I really do. My Muslim family is not so different from hers. I'm a total apostate destined for hell and their disapproval meant violence and shunning. I knew that living authentically would mean cutting myself off from my home community forever, but I couldn't abide a life of secrets and lies. So I made the hard choice and left, made sure I was independent and safe, and THEN went public. It was the harsh reality that this is how it has to be. Women like us don't have the luxury of living in limbo between two worlds. You're either on one side or the other of the veil. Otherwise the secrets and guilt will split you in two until you don't even know who you are anymore.

I don't know what will happen with your relationship together and I honestly think that shouldn't be the priority right now. Maybe put a pin in big future questions and just focus on exploring things as your relationship goes through a new phase. She needs to figure out how to deal with her demons and live authentically. She can't depend on her family anymore and you must not let her shift to trying to depend solely on you. Loss of community is devastating and she may need a bit of time to grieve, but afterwards she needs to learn how to stand up on her own two feet. Not just in terms of material dependence, but emotional as well. She needs to figure out who she is and what she wants from life independent of her old life, to parse through all the manipulation and pain she must have experienced to begin with to cause her to live a hidden double life for so long. She also needs to figure out how to channel her emotions more appropriately and not take sudden rash actions. Even if she decided it was best to break it to her family, she should not have gone nuclear on Facebook all at once and without telling you thats how she was going to do it. She should also never have laid a hand on you, that was absolutely beyond the pale and shows she has trouble controlling her impulses and processing pain and anger in a healthy way. Which no wonder, but it needs to be addressed. Not just making promises and crossing fingers and hoping for the best, she needs to do hard work on herself. 

Try to be open about the future. If it turns out that after working through a bunch of stuff you both feel ready to take the next step together stronger than before, than that is wonderful. If it turns out that you can't see a future together anymore, that is okay too. There are very big changes going on for her and you get to have reservations about what kind of life you're prepared to have in a marriage. No harm no foul. You may feel responsible for her in a sense because of how things went down, but guilt is never a reason to stay and I promise you if it didn't happen with you it would have happened with someone or something else. She was living a double life and the lid was going to come off some way or another.

Good luck to you both."

Apologists will be quick to note that most verses are in contexts of defensive (or at least, retaliatory) violence: while being careful to avoid mentioning what Islam considers ""violence against Islam/the Islamic community"" is quite unlike whatever a secular definition of self-defense would find justifiable.

Making claims that an Islamic community is comparable to or an accurate representation of an Islamic society is misleading in that the community is not necessarily free to forcefully impose on others in society with their culture and beliefs.

As to your gaslighting goalposts statement, you're the one trying to change the topic of discussion.  With respect to what you were trying to imply in that statement, my response is that Christian and Jewish cultures don't actively oppress women to the same degree as Islam. In addition to that, Christian and Jewish feminists/egaltarians routinely point out the negative parts of their religions and aim to reform them to be more inclusive.  Islam refuses to be reformed, and any discussion of the topic is immediately met with violence, vitriol, gaslighting, and retaliation."

If you do tell anyone you will probably face a lot of unnecessary trouble because no way a muslim family is letting a son go away to live alone without any problems. I think it is the best choice not to tell anyone at all as it could lead you to be harmed as it looks like your brother isn’t a stranger to violence.

But, ""Muslim individuals are MORE likely to commit atrocities,"" you say,  ""They are INHERENTLY more likely to be violent,"" you say.


My argument still stands whether the above is true or false.   People deserve to be judged individually.


If there is evidence a person committed a crime or some heinous act - yes, throw the book at them.  If proven guilty, fuck them up even.  But don't take it out on a totally different person just because they look and talk the same.
