0,fz5i350,"That's not action of just one person. I have been hearing news from childhood how underage non Muslim girls are abducted and raped in Pakistan especially Sindh region. 

India appears to have more cases because it has 1.3 out of 7 billion world population.
If Muslim were lynched as you say then population of Muslims wouldn't increase in India. There were cases of lynching because those Muslims were stealing cows of farmers which is one of their investments and no action was taken by government.
Kashmir issue exists because Pakistan sent tribals from North West Pakistan to attack Kashmir. These tribals raped and killed Kashmiris. This forced king to join India.
Terrorists from Pakistan are responsible for rape and murder of kashmiri pandits and eventually their Exodus.

No country is perfect but Pakistan is lot worse than others. Yet many Pakistanis have audacity to point finger at India.

Non Muslim can't contest for prime minister.
Ahmadi Muslim is forced from Imran Khan cabinet because he was not true Muslim.
Pakistan has blasphemy law and people are killed for even accidentally disrespecting Quran. 
Even construction of single temple causes Nationwide outrage in Pakistan.
This list goes on.."
1,fywul4s,And right there you just changed what you said and full on lies. You firstly brought your own morality of “agree with me or your a bad person” then you just lied about your options. You said “yes Muslims are american” not “are Muslim Americans equal”. Those are two completely different questions you stupid fuck.  Then your last question had nothing to do with Muslim Americans but a terrorist groupie that wasn’t even Muslim. Again you stupid fucker. Then lastly you keep saying that I said “Muslim Americans are retarded”. Again you stupid fucker. I called you a libtard for the way you baited the question and now completely lied about what you asked. You aren’t smart you stupid little prick. You have done nothing but claim something I didn’t say while simultaneously not able to comprehend that I’m calling YOU restarted.
2,fvghyf4,"You didn’t, but one of the commenters said that the lumping of Asians with Mainlanders is like lumping Muslim Americans with terrorists. There’s one similarity: Asian Americans and Muslim Americans are both victims of the “China bad/Muslim evil” narrative that’s used to brainwash westerners."
3,fwjbvad,"It's also a really bad look to make a character whose entire thing is ""not all Muslim Americans are terrorists, I'm not a terrorist"" and then....they decide to eventually make him into a terrorist anyway. It stoked the flames of Islamophobia during a time when that was at its absolute worst. There were some interesting aspects of the Muhammad Hassan character but there were also some serious writing misfires that reflect poorly on WWE."
4,fqmnms8,"As far as having mistrust of Muslims, there are legitimate reasons for that. Now let me state strongly that attacks on any innocent people, no matter their race, ethnicity or religion, are never justified and should never happen.  Have you ever read any of the Koran? Do you know what is in it? A lot of hate for the unbeliever. Listen to speakers like Robert Spencer or Pamela Geller. What they say is not ""hate speech"" (which does not exist) but just the truth. 

Oh, I know you will say they are just ""Islamophobes"" (another BS made-up term). Then listen to what ex-Muslims say. People like Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Mark Gabriel, Ibn Warraq and the Apostate Prophet know a little more about Islam than you or I do. All of these people would be executed in Muslim countries, as apostasy carries a death penalty under sharia law. These are the same countries in which gays are killed just for being gay and non-Muslim girls are regularly kidnapped and forced to convert to Islam and marry their captors.

Listen, I've known Muslims who were genuinely nice people. I am by no means saying every Muslim is a terrorist. But there certainly many problems with Islam. No other religion has had people blow themselves up in its name."
5,fo0qzxh,"Woman: Well, I think before 9/11, most Muslims were not even on the radar of most Americans, I mean, I don't even think people would even know. And now, I think it's more of a negative connotation. I really don't think the relationship is at all positive.

Man: I mean, the Muslims are going to end up fallen, you know and it's only gonna be God's people that are going to make it. So, I mean, if you're a Muslim you're in trouble, you know, I mean, so that's the way I see it.

Woman: I was made aware that I was not a full American or not an average or normal American right after September 11th. It's like I went to sleep an American and I woke up an Arab, even though I was born and raised in America.

Host: American Muslims are dazzlingly diverse with roots in every part of the world. They're native born and immigrant, converts, and born into the faith. The community is fast-growing increasingly well-educated and affluent. In the last 10 years, terrorism and wars in Muslim-majority countries raised questions among many Americans about whether Islam is compatible with democracy. Whether Islam could peacefully take its place in pluralist America. After 19 Muslim hijackers attacked the United States, many Muslim-Americans face suspicion. Their loyalty and allegiance to America questioned. Even in communities well away from the spotlight. Places they've called home for decades. Some things don't change in middle Tennessee. They still love hot rods down in Murfreesboro, some 35 miles south of Nashville. Every Friday night during the summer locals turn out to admire dozens of fine old cars. People here say they've seen a lot of change in the decade since the attacks on New York and Washington. 

Man: I think the tragedy of 9/11 has definitely brought the country a lot closer. Closer together and has made us a lot aware of terrorist organizations.

Woman: We went through so much as a nation during that time and now it's almost like people have forgotten it.

Host: For American Muslims, the 10 years since 9/11 have placed the community making steady progress under an uncomfortable scrutiny. I checked in with Dailia Mogahed who samples Mulsim public opinion worldwide for Gallup.

Dalia: Muslim-Americans are the most diverse, the youngest, the most entrepreneurial, among the most educated, among the most employed. They look like model citizens on paper and yet many of them have said that they've spent the past 10 years telling people who they're not rather than telling people who they are.

Host: The population of Murfreesboro is up 50% over the last 10 years. It's the fastest growing city in the state with over 100,000 residents, but it still has a small town feel. With reminders of it's southern heritage everywhere. Like many southern towns, it's also a city of churches. Well over 100 churches at last count. And another house of worship, tucked away behind a car dealer in a converted strip mall, is a mosque, the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro. Like the rest of Murfreesboro , the local Muslim community has been booming. Growing from a single family 30 years ago to more than 250 families now. The Islamic Center bought land and drew up a plan to build the a larger facility, one that would expand over time. In May of 2010, the plan came before the Rutherford county planning commission. There was a bit of routine discussion about issues like drainage, and then the vote. The news took the town by surprise.

Woman: How did this happen? We didn't know anything about it.

Host: Sally Wall, a local realtor, says plans for a house of worship that size usually take years to get approved. 

Sally: We have distributed this about Sharia law as literally people here knew nothing about it. 

Host: Sally and others have become convinced that Muslims were intent on somehow imposing Islamic Law - or Sharia - in America. 9/11 has made her much more wary of Muslims, she says.

Sally: I believe that their purpose in life is to dominate eventually  the governments and the laws of the land where as we separate government and the religion and they don't.

Host: and when the county government next met, there was plenty of public reaction. 

Woman: Everybody knows who's trying to kill us. And it's like we can't say it.

Man: This is my concern, will radical ideas and violence be brought to our doorstep?

Man: I was surprised at the strongly negative response just right out of the gate.

Man: The desire of Islam is to enforce Sharia Law on the every non-Islamic country.

Man: If construction does begin I would also encourage contractors to boycott it and I would encourage the boycott of any contractor associated with the project.

Host: Methodist Pastor Bryan Brooks has led a congregation in this town for years. 

Bryan: Wildly suspicious things being said about people who have been in the community for decades. Who are neighbors and who might be people's friends or professors or doctors. 

Host: As the town divided over the mosque, two sides faced off in the public square.

Man: They're marching down Main street here to present a petition at the courthouse opposing the construction of the mosque.

Woman: You don't don't want a mosque in Murfreesboro?

Woman: No, because that's where they gather to take over America.

Woman: I think that people who protesting the mosque are scared. I think they live in fear.

Man: There's a process that has to be followed and the process wasn't done.

Host: One of the march organizers is Kevin Fisher. He's also trying to block the mosque in court. His suit had two tracks. One said the county failed to give proper notification of the meeting the other said the mosque could endanger public safety by providing a forum for radical Islam. 

Kevin: In a post 9/11 I think the community has a right to be concerned by any group not just Muslim group, any radical group coming into the community. The community has a right to release itself.

Host: While the debate simmered in the streets of Murfreesboro last summer, a similarly divisive disagreement was playing out in New York City. A Muslim group planned a new mosque just a few blocks from ground zero, setting off a national fury."
6,fnnwzyq,"lol what?! Pakistan isn't a race. And we have rational reasons to hate Pakistan. They are literally one of the most fascist countries on the planet! 

Pakistan runs 100s of UN designated terrorist organisations. There is a reason why they are in the grey list of FATF. Even their best friend China didn't vote in favour of them! Not to forget the terrorist attacks they have carried out on our soil like 26/11, Pulwama, Pathankot and funding jihadis in Kashmir.

And here are some rational reasons why Pakistan is fascist and why we Indians hate them:

1. Pakistani schools teach Hindu hatred:

[https://www.dawn.com/news/672000/pakistan-schools-teach-hindu-hatred](https://www.dawn.com/news/672000/pakistan-schools-teach-hindu-hatred)

2. 1000+ non muslim girls are forcefully converted and married off. They can't leave Islam after converting, as there is death penalty for apostasy!

[https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2014/04/08/1000-christian-hindu-girls-forced-to-convert-to-islam-report/](https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2014/04/08/1000-christian-hindu-girls-forced-to-convert-to-islam-report/)

3. 1000+ Shia muslims are killed every year in Pakistan! 23,000 since 1963!

[https://youtu.be/KjdsKVRAbPU](https://youtu.be/KjdsKVRAbPU)

4. Pakistani constitution has anti Ahmediyya laws in place, which says that Ahmediyyas are not muslims.

5. Many Ahmediyyas flew to Nepal because of the persecution

6. Here we have Pakistani PM Imran Khan himself saying that their army has been committing genocide on Balochis!

7. 629 Christian girls were sold to China. There is a reason why non muslim girls are being sold!

[https://apnews.com/c586d0f73fe249718ec06f6867b0244e](https://apnews.com/c586d0f73fe249718ec06f6867b0244e)

8. 5000 Hindus leave Pakistan every year to go to India!

[https://www.dawn.com/news/1105830](https://www.dawn.com/news/1105830)

9. Pakistan accused of dumping over 1000 bodies of Balochis

[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38454483](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38454483)

10. Not to forget that they have names their nuclear missiles after genocidal maniacs who butchered and massacred millions of Hindus. That's like Germany naming their missiles after Hitler and then asking Israel/Jews for peace and friendship.

11. Another fun fact: One can name Muslim celebrities from India, but one can't name Hindu celebrities from Pakistan. The only time a Hindu gets famous in Pakistan is when a Hindu girl is abducted and forcefully converted!

With ethnic cleansing of 10,000+ non sunni muslims every how can one call Pakistan a peaceful country?! It boggles my mind how Pakistan isn't called a fascist country! No other country on the planet commits ethnic cleansing of 10,000+ people every year!"

As far as opening up of Kartarpur corridor is concerned. There is only one motive behind this. That is to fund and revive Khalistani militants in India. This was proven when Pakistan invited Khalistani militants and flashed Sikh referendum dates in a video released by Pakistan government. Even a lot of Sikhs in India have said that Pakistan has ulterior motive behind this, including current Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh."
9,fheyji7,The reform only occurred because of corruption and crisis in the church. Moderate Muslims or third generation Muslim Americans are a good example of this. They are just as moderate as any good Christian in America. All I am saying is that there is no difference and that it is wrong to fear the whole group from the actions of a few. I don’t judge all Christians for the actions of a few White Christian Nationalists just as I don’t judge all Muslims for the actions of a few Arabian Hate-Group Terrorists.
10,fhfz3qg,"&gt;Do you think it’s a coincidence that there is so much war, poverty and violence within them?

if you spend any time in a history class, you’d know about the spread of the ottomans, the imperialism by the British and French empires, and the psychés-picot agreement. if you haven’t, the psychés-picot agreement was the treaty that gave sovereignty to most of the middle eastern states that remain today. if you notice, the borders compose of straight lines, not physical or cultural boundaries. the borders were superimposed which meant that Sunni people and Shiite people were living under the same people, under the same governments. this is the main reason for the unrest between the 2 groups, not the religion as a whole or the way of being of people from the middle east.

&gt;But there are a lot of sympathizers and that is just as bad in my book.

if you are talking about ‘sympathizers’ in the more developed areas, the numbers of those are slim. the problem with the logic that most people have is the fact that they are looking at outliers. if you look at events that Muslim Americans partake in, you are only going to find negative things because of a deep-seeded racism that the wester world has *(im not saying only conservative or liberal people have it, racism is human nature, to be progressive is to look past it).* 99.99% the close-to 3 million Muslim Americans are most likely not sympathizing withe the terrorist events that are happening all over the world in the same way the German-Americans weren’t supporting the holocaust in the ‘40s. and the ‘sympathizers’ in the middle-east you are talking about are usually citizens of the IS, Al-Queda, and Taliban ruled lands. if they dont pledge allegiance, they are putting themselves to be executed

&gt; I'll never understand how a person that calls them self a liberal or a progressive can be a supporter of Islam. It makes zero sense. Their values couldn't be anymore misaligned with each other.

most of the values of islam are similar to the values of christianity. and for every quote you could misconstrue as negative in the Quran, you can find in the Bible too. the whole point of being progressive is that you want people to just live their life freely and have equal chances at a happy life without people disregarding them because of their religious views. 

&gt; And finally, it's not a race issue, it's a religion issue. There are millions of Christian and Jewish people in the middle east that have the same brown skin and they seem to be able to live in peace.

nope. nope nope nope you did not just say that seriously. Judaism and Christianity has been historically and presently just as violent, if not more violent, as Islam. [Judaism had been the ruling power in the muddle east for a long time and there are still Jewish terrorist attacks today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_religious_terrorism?wprov=sfti1) and [Christianity had the Crusades and many violent acts against Muslim and other religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism?wprov=sfti1). even today there have been squables on both sides in the middle east."
11,fbbxtqi,"&gt;Edit: The silence is deafening here.

Dude, I am not on stand by ready to answer things on reddit at a moment's notice you fucking idiot no-lifer.

&gt;but ultimately the system works. 

Dumbest statement of the year.

First of all full transparency from the police is necessary. They should not be allowed to hide the gruesome reality of multiculturalism like they have done in the past and continue to do. 

Second targeted education is necessary. At-risk girls need to be educated on what threats are out there, how to see and identify grooming among their friends and among themselves. And there will no hiding the fact that pakistani gangs are especially something to look out for. This should be mandatory for any girl who lives in foster care. Teachers, all police, medical workers, social services and any adult who regularly deals with children and girls need to be educated on how to spot signs of grooming as well. This is mandatory for all of them. 

Specific pakistani communities must also be targeted for education. Here it's necessary to work with local imams and mosques, and those imams who refuse to cooperate will face some sort of consequences. The main part of their education will happen in mosques, where pakistani communities will learn about the gruesome behaviour of members of their communities, and learn what to do when they know this is happening in their community. Local imams must also be cooperative with the police in giving tips and assistance if the imam suspects that some of his members are committing these foul acts. This is in the Imams and mosques favor, as fighting pakistani human trafficking will better their image in the public. The pakistani and muslim cultural attitude that white girls and non-muslim girls are girls that don't deserve respect needs to be stamped out. It's literally parents, uncles, cousins, and brothers who are teaching this to younger generations, and this needs to be stopped. I don't know how.

Third, it's necessary to create a specific police task force that specifically deals with grooming cases. They deal with no other police work, and take every report seriously, unlike regular police who just sweep it under the rug and say ""whores will be whores"" while they are busy with other work. British police are absolute shit and they can't effectively fight this since their culture, education and attitudes are so shit. It's better to just start a new force, similarly to how the regular police don't deal with terrorist threats. Here profiling pakistani communities is necessary. 

Fourth, any British citizen who commits very serious crimes, especially human trafficking or rape of children, will face deportation after prison IF THEY HAVE DUAL CITIZENSHIP AND WERE NOT BORN IN BRITAIN. This is going to stamp out most of the old pakistani geezers paying paki trafficking gangs to rape white children. Doesn't matter how long they have been in Britain, they need to go. Doesn't matter how sad the grandkids are going to be, grandpa needs to get the fuck out because he is a pedo, which is probably best for the grandkids as well.

These are four steps. The last is the most radical, but one would get pretty far using only the three first steps."
12,f9y6iww,"They don't, at least not in any quantity. This is a stupid strawman that mediocre conservatives made up because they dumb and wrong and have trouble understanding things that are even a little bit complicated (""complicated"" here meaning requiring you to think for maybe three consecutive seconds). 

Here, let me explain it to you. You can simultaneously oppose the bad features of an ideology *and* oppose mistreatment of the people who hold it or hysterical misrepresentation of it. Again, for the slow kids in the back here: you can recognize that an ideology has bad regressive features to it, but also--yes, at the same time even, how wacky!--recognize that some ""criticism"" of that ideology is in fact not actually reasonable, and may actually be pretty bad and regressive itself. When a bumblefuck white conservative says that muslims are all terrorists or that American muslims are way more of a threat to queer people than he is and they're called a ignorant racist piece of shit for it, the person calling them out is not ""pro ignoring Muslim homophobia"", they're ""pro fact"", and the facts show that Muslim Americans are *less homophobic* than American evangelicals and are group least likely to think that violence for political gain is ever okay. *Criticism* of Islam is fine and good. ""Criticism"" that is just a vehicle for the criticizer to be a histrionic racist piece of shit is not. 

Get it?"
13,f9f2wez,"Yep all the media houses and your usual social justice loud mouths have blamed everything from “Indian culture (read Hindu culture/Dharmic culture, not the “modern” Bollywood communist culture ofcourse), Indian men (read mostly Hindus and Sikh men) for this rape as well and how women must get more rights and need to be more equal. Literally zero have talked about muslim men committing the most number of rapes and there being a trend of non muslim women being targeted as a “rape jihad” of sorts. 

No one is talking about the obvious Islamic angle behind these rapes and murders and how non muslim girls are specifically targeted by muslim grooming gangs for rape/exploitation, fully supported by leftists.

https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/635942/Islam-Scholar-Saud-Saleh-Cairo-Slavery-Muslim-Women-Pagan-ISIS-Al-Azhar-University-Egypt

This is what is commonly taught in mosques and madrasas. 

More shitty Bollywood movies and documentaries would be made to target Hindus and Sikhs while ignoring islamic rapists who actually commit these crimes completely. Nirbhaya’s rapist was muslim too who was released from jail and awarded a sewing machine by kejriwal 

saw this on twitter: http://tinyimg.io/i/aHgYoUE.jpeg

There’s an islamic terrorist crisis and islam must be dismantled as a national security priority. 

http://tinyimg.io/i/LO0imem.jpeg

Love jihad is a very real concept where non muslim women are specifically targeted, raped, drugged, trafficked and then killed. 

The real question is, why are leftists and communists and media and Bollywood so interested in denying that love jihad exists and these things happen. 

Democracy is useless if this is what it leads, entire ecosystem lying to defend a foreign cult"
14,f2b8eg4,"Tbh that was pretty islamophobic, I don't blame him.

Downvote me if you want, but first read up on what the Islamic religion is actually about before judging it saying that, 'all muslims are bad' when it's not true. Im not religious, but I know that the terrorists aren't representative of the whole Islamic religion; they're just extremists. They're like those really crazy religious people that you find in any other religion. The truth is, real muslims are completely fine with people that are from other religions, saying that they also can be in heaven. Muslims these days try to be the most kind, thoughtful, helpful people that they can be. Many muslim americans are doctors, lawyers and engineers.

Go online and try to find out more, and maybe that might change your mind. If not, thats fine. Everyone has their own opinions."
15,ezxki5n,"it's unfair to take her comments out of context, though.

she was expressing exasperation at the fact that Muslim Americans are *constantly* asked to condemn every single terrorist attack anywhere in the world over and over and over again, when the same standard is *never* applied to Christians or Jews."
16,eu4592z,"[Here's another quote of hers for context](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/04/rep-ilhan-omars-9-11-comments-in-context/):

&gt; “Many people expect, expect our community to feel like it needs to hide every time something happens,” Omar said, referring to the American Muslim community. “But repeatedly we have shown them that we are not to be bullied. We are not to be threatened. We are not to be terrorized. We are strong and resilient, and we will always show up to be ourselves because we know we have a right to a dignified existence and a dignified life.”
&gt; 
&gt; Omar’s speech came a week after a gunman opened fire at two mosques in New Zealand on March 15, killing at least 50 people.
&gt; 
&gt; Omar said many Muslims feared such a tragedy was coming, because they have heard threats at their mosques and in their schools or have witnessed acts of violence targeting Muslims. And she said, “Many of us know that this is not a one-off incident.”
&gt; 
&gt; Omar said discrimination against Muslims has been exacerbated by President Donald Trump, who once said, “I think Islam hates us.” She went on to say that the president “thinks it is OK, it is OK to speak about a faith and a whole community in a way that is dehumanizing, vilifying, and doesn’t understand — or at least makes us want to think that he doesn’t understand — the consequences that his words might have.”
&gt; 
&gt; Omar said that despite trying to be good neighbors, Muslim Americans are often made to feel like second-class citizens.
&gt;
&gt; “Muslims for a really long time in this country have been told that there is a privilege, that there is a privilege that we are given and it might be taken away,” Omar said. “We are told that we should be appropriate. We should go to school, get an education, raise our children, and not bother anyone, not make any kind of noise. Don’t make anyone uncomfortable. Be a good Muslim. But no matter how much we have tried to be the best neighbor, people have always worked on finding a way to not allow for every single civil liberty to be extended to us.”
&gt; 
&gt; “It doesn’t matter how good you are,” Omar said. “If you one day find yourself in a school where other religions are talked about, but when Islam is mentioned, we are only talking about terrorists. And if you say something, you are sent to the principal’s office. So to me, I say, raise hell. Make people uncomfortable. Because here’s the truth, here’s the truth, far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen. And frankly, I’m tired of it. And every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it.”

I'm not a Muslim myself but I completely understand why she - and other Muslims - are sick and tired of constantly having to defend being Muslims. Does she really have to distance herself from the 9/11 terrorists each and every time she makes a statement about whatever? Does she really have to distance herself from ISIS and Al-Quaida each and every time she speaks publicly? Is that a reasonable request?"
17,evc2x50,"I believe the answer to this, in ISIS Omar's case, is because she has constantly claimed ALL white or non-Muslim Americans are racist, in her opinion America is a terrible place, and Jews are actualy nazis.  These are all things she has said publicly and ""on the record"" numerous times.  Our country allowed her family to come here to save their lives and they have greatly benefited from everything America has to offer.  She, as an elected official, is supposed to call out REAL problems that need fixing and then try to fix them.  She is supposed to represent the best interests of as many of the Americans in her elected area as she can.  Makes you wonder just who and what these people are that elected her? Religous freedom is a bedrock principle of America, but ANY religion that seeks to oppress anyone for any reason, actively encourages terrorism, and actively practices pedophilia is not something that is in the best interests of real Americans.  If you don't believe Islam does all these things, then you should read their ""holy book"". I have and it does call for and encourage all of these things as part of their ""duty"" to their god.  I have 2 friends that came here legally from a Muslim country. They were raised with Muslim teachings and they have said and actively tell anyone who will listen that Islam is a religion of of all these things and more. They ran away from this religion because they realized just how terrible and evil it really is.  Those are their words not mine.  ISIS Omar and Rashida Taliban are nothing more than Islamic political terrorists in our midst."

Let's be honest guys, Chinese Americans, Latino Americans, Indian Americans, Muslim Americans are not making these statements.

They aren't disproportionately shooting dead unarmed blacks

They aren't disproportionately bailing out banks

They aren't disproportionately starting wars costing trillions

In the same way the white community wants Latinos to stop illegal, Muslims to stop terrorists, blacks to stop crime, we need to hear white people condemn such brazen racism and backwardness in their own communities. We need accountability."

Nigerians in Malaysia are similarly stereotyped and marginalised by Malaysians (of all races, apparently the only thing that unites Malays, Chinese, and Indians is hating others) because of attributes they cannot control.

&amp;#x200B;

Also if you're a Muslim, I think your Prophet said quite a few things on why racism is wrong? ""The Arab is not superior to the non-Arab"" and all that? So maybe try to follow that shit, eh? Again, assuming you're Muslim.

Sad that we have to remind people like you that **racism is wrong** on a video of an innocent student fucking dying in the custody of our imigresen agents"
20,epzr69m,"""I'm not presenting a proper counter argument, primarily because of time. But a rebuttal could simply be that muslim americans are more radicalized per 100,000 due to oppression of their religion, racism, the way they are treated in every day life, and the general hate they have been met with in a post 9/11 world. ""

The problem is with that is in the Muslim world where Muslims are given higher priority over everyone. With the fact that Christians are more persecuted there than Muslims here. Not only do they have higher Muslim attacks against other groups (including Muslims) it's much higher than rates of Christians and other religious groups in those areas that are persecuted. 

The fact that a lot of terrorists are recently converted (less likely to have been persecuted for their beliefs for most of their lives) or lived/studied in a Muslim dominated area discounts this.  

The majority of Muslim attackers have either dual citizenship or are only a couple generations down. If you are 4th or 5th generation  Muslim and haven't traveled or lived in a Muslim country you're less likely to commit a terrorist act."

Islam is not a race. There are [Chinese](http://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/03/13/87fffe94-bc18-11e6-b1a9-d0a597083a8f_660x385.JPG) Muslims in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. There are [white](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g5KfYD9vfk&amp;t=4) Muslims in Europe. There are [black](https://i.imgur.com/sbDWCJ5.jpg) Muslims in Somalia.

&amp;nbsp;

Islam is not a religion of unconditional peace. In Quran 60:8, ***""Allah does not stop you from acting kind to unbelievers who won't put up a fight over Islam and will leave you alone in your homes.""*** It sounds good if they're going to be ""kind"" to us, right? But notice how peace is allowed with only the quiet ones. In Quran 4:148, ***""Allah does not like the public mention of evil"".*** You're not given the freedom of speech to criticize the Quran. You're [not allowed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/16/pakistan-man-sentenced-to-death-for-ridiculing-prophet-muhammad-on-whatsapp) to draw a cartoon of Muhammad. In Quran 9:29, ***""Fight those who do not believe in Allah... until they give the jizya willingly while they are humbled.""*** Unbelievers can have peace as long as they pay a tax called ""[jizya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YOgu6rDme8)."" Every mention of ""peace"" in the Quran is tied to certain [terms and conditions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkOPHu1w73Q&amp;t=44s).

&amp;nbsp;

The ""liberal"" wants to defend the poor, innocent refugee against the big, bad bully. Yes, we criticize the ideology, but we are not necessarily against the individual. It's possible that the local Muslim guy plays basketball, watches movies, and eats ice cream. There's nothing wrong with these things. He's a human being like the rest of us, but the underlying problem is with Islam on a religious, cultural, and political level. In Quran 98:6, ***""Unbelievers from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and polytheists will live in the [fire of hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHYnrYG2oAk). They are the worst of all creatures.""*** The moderate Muslim [believes in this passively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxA9i7zFGKA&amp;t=5m37s). In Quran 3:28, ***""Muslim brothers must not put an unbeliever above other Muslims. Whoever does that will never be helped by Allah...""*** Muslims are commanded to favor their own kind in business or politics. At the end of the day, the ""[nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO9gWwEVdzo&amp;t=3)"" Muslim guy will obey his mosque and place his own [family over you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RScj18u_QCM).

24,emfdype,"To sum it down, her point was that muslim americans are treated worse ever since 9/11. 9/11 is its own reference to the terrorist attack. The ""some people did something, and all of us are etc."" Is her point that all muslims faced sigma because the attackers were muslim."
25,emgy15d,"I like the unique perspective you shared, especially in the last paragraph. But curious about your statement on the acceptance for homosexuality bit. It left me a bit confused. Do you think the Muslim/ Liberal alliance is stupid because of them accepting homosexuality? Not judging, just curious if you don’t approve of homosexuality because of your religion or is their acceptance just something that is against their religion so it’s hypocritical. (Assumption, not trying to be rude, I just barely meet any Muslims who aren’t liberals. So you have peaked my interest) 

Personally, I think it’s stupid to demonize an entire religion based on the actions of the few, but I understand why it’s done. As a Catholic, whenever something terrible is done, like murder, by a fellow “Catholic” or even Christian, I am so disgusted, I make it known that I disagree with their actions as that’s not what I believe. However I noticed that where I live, a very liberal city, Muslims rarely do that. They mostly, at least the ones I know and met, make up excuses for the actions of others, without denouncing their actions nor denouncing it with their religion, like verses in the Kuran, which makes me doubt them. 
Like take Omar, and her comments about 9/11, which is “some people did something”. Yes, I watched the whole video, not just her clip. That event was a horrible day, week, month, etc. for everyone even remotely involved, even indirectly. I wouldve approved had she stated something more like, “there are people in this world who take our religion and distort it and commit terrible actions in the name of Allah.” And then go on to mention that since then Muslim Americans are constantly viewed as possible terrorists. Idk. I just think it’d help if Muslim communities started to voice their unhappiness as well whenever bad shit happens. 

But honestly overall, it wouldn’t take me much to welcome a Muslim into the conservative community, aside from denouncing terrible actions of actions, which everyone should do regardless and not make up excuses. Basically just state and follow through that you wouldn’t force your religion onto us, nor each other, as I’ve seen fellow Muslims do it to each other and you believe there should be a separation of religion and state.

I was raised catholic, going to church and all that non-sense. When I grew up, I chose to not follow that religion anymore.

There are 0 similarities to being born in the US and still believing in a violent book. American “culture” is dozens of different countries cultures put in one. We have every nationality here all over the country. Not many non Muslim Americans are running around beheading people because they are “the enemy of god.” 

I understand what you’re saying, not all Muslims are extremists terrorist. But the religion they follow combined with their very strict religious culture, with extreme and negative views on every non Muslim makes it easy to justify beheadings and terrorist acts against non Muslims. There aren’t 1.6 billion white nationalist around the world actively practicing moderate to extreme Nazi propaganda. They say around 25% of the worlds Muslims are extremists, that’s 300million extremist Muslims around the world committing jihad against non Muslims.

&gt; In a 2007 survey titled Muslim Americans: Middle Class and Mostly Mainstream, the Pew Research Center found Muslim Americans to be ""largely integrated, happy with their lives, and moderate with respect to many of the issues that have divided Muslims and Westerners around the world.""

&gt; A 2011 Pew poll reported support for extremism among Muslim Americans is negligible. [199] The poll indicated all segments of the Muslim American population were opposed to violence and to a correlation between support for suicide bombing and religiosity measures.[199] A 2007 Pew poll reported that very few Muslim Americans (1%) supported suicide bombings against civilian targets in at least some circumstances, with 81% reporting that suicide bombings and other forms of violence against civilians are never justified.[199] Favorable views towards Al Qaeda were held by a comparably smaller percentage among Muslim Americans, 2% very favorable and 3% somewhat favorable.

&gt; Muslim Americans are significantly represented among those who tip authorities off to alleged plots having given 52 of the 140 documented tips regarding individuals involved in violent terrorist plots since 9/11.

&gt; In a 2007 poll conducted by Pew Research Center, 27% of American Muslims believed that homosexuality should be accepted. In a 2011 poll, that percentage had risen to 39%. In a July 2017 poll, Muslims who say homosexuality should be accepted by society outnumber those who say it should be discouraged (52% of respondents, versus 33%).[187][188].According to research by the Public Religion Research Institute’s 2017 American Values Atlas, 51% of American Muslims favor same-sex marriage, while 34% are opposed.

&gt; The Pew Research survey also showed that nearly three quarters of respondents believed that American society rewards them for hard work regardless of their religious background.[184]

&gt;The same poll also reported that 40% of U.S. Muslims believe that Arab Muslims carried out the 9/11 attacks. Another 28% do not believe it and 32% said they had no opinion. Among the 28% who doubted that Arab Muslims were behind the conspiracy, one-fourth said the U.S. government or President George W. Bush was responsible. 26% of American Muslims believe the U.S.-led ""war on terror"" is a sincere effort to root out international terrorism. 5% of those surveyed had a ""very favorable"" or ""somewhat favorable"" view of Al-Qaeda. 35% of American Muslims stated that the decision for military action in Afghanistan was the right one and 12% supported the use of military force in Iraq.[183]

&gt;In 2011, a Gallup poll found that 93% of Muslim Americans considered themselves loyal to the United States.[185]

&gt;Although American Muslims do report feeling discriminated against as a religious minority, they are just as likely as the general public (81%) to say they value their American Identity. In fact, a 2018 study done by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding asserts that, “a higher religious identity correlates with a higher American identity among all Americans, especially Muslims.”

I know this is a long read, but how do you feel about the seemingly overwhelming number of polls that indicate American Muslims are fairly highly integrated? It should be stated that religious texts=/=interpretations and practices of certain religions texts. With that context in mind, how do you feel about how there are sections in the Bible where God becomes completely brutal and backwards, ordering the slaughtering of villages and the enslavement of their women and children? Is that not acceptable with Western values? TL;DR at the bottom.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_violence


&gt; You must destroy (consume) all the peoples the Lord your God gives over to you. Deuteronomy 7:16

&gt; you shall make their name perish from under heaven…"" while Deuteronomy 20:10-18 says ""…you shall not leave alive anything that breathes. But you shall utterly destroy (ha-harem taharimem) them, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite and the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, as the Lord your God has commanded you…"". ""Amos 1:3–2:3 uses akal to indict Israel’s neighbors for various acts of cruelty during war (e.g., the Ammonites “ripped open pregnant women in Gilead in order to enlarge their territory”; 1:13) and uses those war crimes of surrounding peoples to draw a parallel with Israel’s mistreatment of the poor, thus elevating economic injustice to the level of war crimes."" (2:6–8).[1]:44

&gt; On Moses' command, the Levites kill about three thousand people (Exodus 32).[27]

&gt; Leviticus 17-26, sets out a list of prohibitions, and the punishments for breaking them. Punishments include execution, sometimes by stoning or burning.[29]

&gt; In Numbers 15, a man is found working on the Sabbath. God orders him to be killed and he is stoned

&gt; The Israelites conquer the cities of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and they ""smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him remaining; and they possessed his land."" (Numbers 21)

&gt; Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves"" (Numbers 31).

&gt; Deuteronomy 7 orders the complete annihilation of the indigenous inhabitants of Canaan.

&gt; Deuteronomy 17 punishes anyone who worships any deity or feature of the natural world with stoning to death, and likewise imposes the death penalty on anyone who disobeys the judicial decision of a priest.[45]

&gt; Deuteronomy 20 regulates warfare, allowing for various exemptions from military service, and mandating that a city which Israel fights (outside of Canaan) should have all of its males slaughtered, with women taken as spoils of war. The Canaanites, on the other hand, are to be completely exterminated (20) exempting only the fruit trees.[44]:310–311 Deuteronomy 21 commands the use of sacrifices to atone for blood in cases where a murderer cannot be identified, and mandates a month-long period of mourning before an Israelite warrior can have sexual relations with a female captive. It also mandates the stoning to death of rebellious children. Deuteronomy 22 orders the killing of women who cannot prove that they were virgins on their wedding night, and of both the man and woman when a man sleeps with another man's wife. It also mandates the death penalty for a man who has sexual relations with a betrothed virgin, and of the virgin if she does not cry out for help when raped.

&gt; If men get into a fight with one another, and the wife of one intervenes to rescue her husband from the grip of his opponent by reaching out and seizing his genitals, you shall cut off her hand; show no pity"" (25:11-12).[46][47] This chapter also urges the extermination of the Amalekites (verses 17-19).

&gt; If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them."" Chapter 20 verse 13

&gt; You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination."" Chapter 18 verse 22

With all of the above in mind, would you not agree that religious text, like the Bible or Quran, both advocate violence? I won’t argue that Islamic countries are peaceful on the large, in part due to the ease at which fundamentalists can rise to power in developing countries. Look at the Christian terrorism around the world, it’s definitely not as prevalent as Islamic terror but it can be horrific in places like the Central African Republic. 

TL;DR: Religious fundamentalist ideology can’t be projected to the vast majority of the millions of Muslims in the US, just as it can’t be applied to the vast majority of Christians in the US.

(**2**) Islam is not a religion of unconditional peace. In Quran 60:8, ***""Allah does not stop you from acting kind to unbelievers who won't put up a fight over Islam and will leave you alone in your homes.""*** It sounds good if they're going to be ""kind"" to us, right? But notice how peace is allowed with only the quiet ones. In Quran 4:148, ***""Allah does not like the public mention of evil"".*** You're not given the freedom of speech to criticize the Quran.

(**3**) The liberal wants to defend the poor, innocent refugee against the big, bad bully. Yes, we criticize the ideology, but we are not necessarily against the individual. It's possible that the local Muslim guy plays basketball, watches movies, and eats ice cream. There's nothing wrong with these things. He's a human being like the rest of us, but the underlying problem is with Islam on a religious, cultural, and political level. In Quran 98:6, ***""Unbelievers from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and polytheists will live in the [fire of hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHYnrYG2oAk).

You're not given the freedom of speech to criticize the Quran. You're not allowed to draw a cartoon of Muhammad. In Quran 9:29, ""Fight those who do not believe in Allah... until they give the jizya willingly while they are humbled."" Unbelievers can have peace as long as they pay a tax called ""jizya."" Every mention of ""peace"" in the Quran is tied to certain terms and conditions.

 

(3) The liberal wants to defend the poor, innocent refugee against the big, bad bully. Yes, we criticize the ideology, but we are not necessarily against the individual. It's possible that the local Muslim guy plays basketball, watches movies, and eats ice cream. There's nothing wrong with these things. He's a human being like the rest of us, but the underlying problem is with Islam on a religious, cultural, and political level. In Quran 98:6, ""Unbelievers from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and polytheists will live in the fire of hell. They are the worst of all creatures."" The moderate Muslim believes in this passively. In Quran 3:28, ""Muslim brothers must not put an unbeliever above other Muslims. Whoever does that will never be helped by Allah..."" Muslims are commanded to favor their own kind in business or politics. At the end of the day, the ""nice"" Muslim guy will obey his mosque and place his own family over you.

 

(4) Islam does not support equality for women.

•	⁠Women have to sit apart from men. •	⁠""A Muslim girl refused to shake the hand of the German president"". •	⁠Muslim boys are taught from an early age that girls are inferior. •	⁠A Muslim woman tries to force another to wear the hijab. •	⁠Women get arrested in Iran just for dancing. •	⁠A Muslim woman reveals, ""...we were strictly controlled - what we said, who we said it to, where we went, what we wore, who we married."" •	⁠Another admits, ""I was never allowed out of the house on my own, I didn't go on school trips, have white friends or was allowed to wear what I wanted"". •	⁠Another wrote, ""Islamically it's incorrect for girls to be friends with a guy"". •	⁠Another said, ""One of the unspoken rules is as a bride you have to behave submissively and look downcast."" •	⁠Another said, ""I tried to tell them about the violence and abuse I had suffered throughout the marriage, but was advised to be quiet."" •	⁠Muslim schools teach that it's ok for a man to beat his wife. •	⁠137,000 women and girls have had genital mutilation surgery in England and Wales. •	⁠Liberals ""hope"" that Islam will get reformed, but attempts to open up their culture have already been rejected in Iran and Afghanistan.

 

(5) The liberal will say that Muslims had a ""Golden Age"" in history. The reality is they fought with swords, traded slaves, and set up a caliphate. Muslims conquered Egypt, Persia, Spain, and Constantinople. The artisans and mathematicians were forced to work under an Islamic regime. The Muslims themselves did not bring an enlightening philosophy. They believed it was ok to drink from a pond that had a dead donkey. In the late 1700s, Muslim pirates from Tripoli captured American ships. Muslims also supported the Nazis. In modern times only 3 or about 0.5% of Nobel Prize winners are Muslim (excluding the Peace Prize and literature). Muslim schools are teaching children to be intolerant.

 

(6) The liberal says that Muslims will integrate into society and enrich us with diversity. But Muslims can't eat bacon for breakfast, can't enjoy a beer at a baseball game, and can't play with a dog at the park. Their sisters and daughters can't wear a bikini at the beach. In reality the Muslims may ask for a 15-minute break to do one of their 5 prayers or have lower productivity during their month of fasting.

As a teenager, I was taken to various houses and flats above takeaways in the north of England, to be beaten, tortured and raped over 100 times. I was called a “white slag” and “white c***” as they beat me.
They made it clear that because I was a non-Muslim, and not a virgin, and because I didn’t dress “modestly”, that they believed I deserved to be “punished”....As someone who has experienced life inside a grooming gang, I can tell you with certainty that none of this is likely to make any difference to the behaviours of groomers. Like terrorists, they firmly believe that the crimes they carry out are justified by their religious beliefs....Religious indoctrination is a big part of the process of getting young men involved in grooming gang crime. Religious ideas about purity, virginity, modesty and obedience are taken to the extreme until horrific abuse becomes the norm. It was taught to me as a concept of “othering”.
“Muslim girls are good and pure because they dress modestly, covering down to their ankles and wrists, and covering their crotch area. They stay virgins until marriage. They are our girls.
""White girls and non-Muslim girls are bad because you dress like slags. You show the curves of your bodies (showing the gap between your thighs means you’re asking for it) and therefore you’re immoral. White girls sleep with hundreds of men. You are the other girls. You are worthless and you deserve to be gang-raped.”
This hateful religious hypocrisy strikes people to their very core. But it’s far from unique. My main perpetrator quoted scriptures from the Quran to me as he beat me.

44,e99ebah,"&gt;Muslim Americans are the staunchest opponents of military attacks on civilians, compared with members of other major religious groups Gallup has studied in the United States. Seventy-eight percent of Muslim Americans say military attacks on civilians are never justified. [Graph](https://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/njiym7x7nkuh2cnawawxka.gif)

&gt;In sharp contrast with Americans who identify themselves with other faith groups, Muslim Americans are more likely to say military attacks on civilians are never justified (78%) than sometimes justified (21%). Respondents from other faith groups, particularly Mormon Americans, are more likely to say military attacks are sometimes justified than never justified. The opinions of Americans who don't identify themselves with any religion are more in line with those of Muslim Americans, but they are also more divided.

&gt;There is wider agreement that attacks on civilians by individuals or small groups are never justified. At least 7 in 10 American adults from all major religious groups agree that these attacks are never justified, but Muslim Americans again are most opposed, with 89% rejecting such attacks. [Graph](https://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/gfhduttxaueh0crpgmnwna.gif)

&gt;In line with their high disapproval of the targeting and killing of civilians by individuals or small groups, 92% of Muslim Americans think that Muslims living in the U.S. do not sympathize with the al Qaeda terrorist organization. [Graph](https://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/1ncqsucjq0ayr7hny82kqg.gif)

https://news.gallup.com/poll/148763/muslim-americans-no-justification-violence.aspx

&gt;Gallup analysis suggests that one's religious identity and level of devotion have little to do with one's views about targeting civilians. According to the largest global study of its kind, covering 131 countries, it is human development and governance - not piety or culture - that are the strongest factors in explaining differences in how the public perceives this type of violence.

&gt;The implications of these findings on public policy are far-reaching. The research suggests that to increase the public's rejection of targeting civilians, leaders would do well to focus far more on education and government accountability, and far less on religious ideology.

&gt;**Predominantly Muslim Societies Reject Violence at Least as Much as Other Societies**

&gt;Since 9/11, voices arguing that Islam encourages violence more than other religions have grown louder - most recently in the manifesto penned by Anders Breivik before he gunned down more than 70 people in Norway. In his manifesto, Breivik argues that Islam is intrinsically violent and peaceful Muslims are simply ignoring their faith's injunctions to kill. He cites dozens of European and American pundits to support this assertion. If this popular claim were true, it would logically follow that Islam's adherents would be more likely than others to condone violence, even if most find it easier not to follow through on their beliefs, as Breivik contends.

&gt;The evidence refutes this argument. Residents of the Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states are slightly less likely than residents of non-member states to view military attacks on civilians as sometimes justified, and about as likely as those of non-member states to say the same about individual attacks. [Graph](https://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/ADGC/7vu6rcl4qemnfbhwmgfzfg.png)

&gt;**No Link Between Views of Violence and Importance of Religion**

&gt;In addition to those who single Islam out, some pundits, most notably the ""New Atheists,"" have accused religion in general of encouraging violence. Though the motivations of actual terrorists are beyond the scope of this brief, the evidence regarding public support for targeting civilians challenges this notion.

&gt;An analysis of public opinion from more than 130 countries, conducted as part of the Gallup World Poll, finds that public acceptance of violence against non-combatants is not linked to religious devotion. In Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, those who reject attacks on civilians are as likely as those who see them as sometimes justified to hold religion in high esteem. Though there appears to be a difference linking religiosity and sympathy for attacks on civilians among the residents of the U.S. and Canada, this difference is not statistically significant. In Europe and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), those who reject military and individual attacks on civilians are more likely to say religion is an important part of their daily lives. [Graph](https://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/ADGC/s5odlmpkvumd18wo5dnorw.png)

&gt;**Americans and Canadians Are Most Likely to Say Military Attacks on Civilians Are Sometimes Justified**

&gt;While the majority of world citizens agree that military attacks targeting civilians are never justified, a decade after 9/11, there is a wide range in the level of support for this view. A clear majority in Asia and MENA find military attacks against civilians unacceptable. This is not surprising considering the acute conflicts raging in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and other parts of the Middle East. [Graph](https://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/ADGC/bzdvtb6ptuymkc1fzm_log.png)

&gt;Whereas there is a 29-percentage-point spread between the highest and lowest levels of rejection of military attacks on civilians between MENA and the U.S. and Canada, global views regarding individual or small groups' attacks on civilians are more similar.

&gt;The identity of the attacker makes a difference to some people when weighing the justification of targeting civilians. When attacks are committed by a military, Americans and Canadians find them more acceptable (47% sometimes justified) than when they are committed by an individual (21% sometimes justified). Europeans, too, make a distinction, and are more likely to reject individual attacks than military attacks by eight percentage points.

&gt;On the other hand, populations in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, former Soviet countries, and MENA are more likely to view violence targeting civilians as uniformly unacceptable. [Graph](https://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/ADGC/yrawgoykakayfhwm4ayuqq.png)

&gt;**Implications: Why Public Perceptions of Targeting Civilians Matters**

&gt;It is important to note that public perceptions of civilian attacks do not necessarily predict violence against non-combatants, nor are terrorist activities or war crimes necessarily the result of public support. For example, one of the masterminds of the 9/11 terrorist attack, Mohamed Atta, and the current leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, were both from middle-class Egyptian families. Yet, Egypt ties Finland as the country with the highest level of unequivocal rejection of individual attacks against civilians. Furthermore, Egypt ranks as one of the top countries in the world for rejecting military attacks against civilians. Norwegians are among the most likely to say individual attacks against civilians are never justified, though a Norwegian this year carried out one of the worst terrorist attacks in European history. This suggests that terrorist activity is largely on the periphery, carried out despite community rejection and not with its tacit support.

&gt;Moreover, whereas terrorist groups are not legitimate representatives of their countries of origin or the national or religious groups they claim to represent, militaries in contrast are legitimate state actors, representing the citizens of their countries. Not only does the military represent the public in a democratic state, but it is made up of a cross section of that public. Strong public consensus against the military targeting civilians as never justified means members of the defense establishment will be intrinsically and strongly committed to avoiding civilian casualties as well as to holding accountable those who violate the laws of war, a foundation to global peace and security.

46,e4mt7jp,"I never said they're pushed down as much as they were 50 years ago. Regardless of how bad it is, minority races still aren't treated the same as white people. Like look at Hollywood for example. Most of the famous actors are white. I know there are plenty that aren't, but majority casts are typically white. It makes it hard to find jobs in that field for black, Hispanic, or Asian people. I mean look at Infinity War, the biggest movie this year. The ratio of white:black actors is extremely askew. This article explains it well here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/02/27/entertainment/hollywood-study-diversity/index.html

It's also been shown that black people are much more likely to be killed in a police shooting than a white person, even if more white people are killed in them. https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/do-police-kill-more-whites-than-black-people/

It's also shown that minorities have a harder time finding a job. People prefer to have white people work under them than other races. Proof here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/identities/2017/9/18/16307782/study-racism-jobs

But José Zamora is also proof that this mindset still goes into practice. He ""Americanized"" his name and all of a sudden he was getting much more job offers, when before he wasn't getting much of anything. There are many websites that reported on this; https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5753880


There was tons of oppression towards middle eastern people after 9/11, just because they came from the same area as the terrorists that bombed the WTC.

This link directs to personal accounts of Muslim and middle eastern lives after 9/11, in which they changed drastically. Being forced to change who you are or how you act to fit the societal norm or just so you won't be harassed is deemed oppression. And discrimination towards them still occurs today. The article linked below stated that Muslim Americans are 5 times more likely to be a victim of a hate crime than before 9/11, and that was written in 2015. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/11/11/muslims-are-facing-a-civil-rights-crisis-in-america/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.c2f3d0d68cc4

Lastly, systematic oppression is very real today and very prominent in society. I've got to get to school, so I don't have time to explain. Though the source is odd, they provide many of their own sources, enough to become a valid resource for this topic https://www.benjerry.com/home/whats-new/2016/systemic-racism-is-real

I grew up with some great Muslim neighbors who softened my heart towards Muslims, but also to this day I think that devour Sharia Muslims are one of the most dangerous threats to society, because I grew up without a dad from age 3-17 because my dad got called up to active duty when he was in the Pentagon when the plane hit there. Just to reiterate and clarify: I think almost all Muslim-Americans are fine. They aren’t radical and are very friendly people. According to stats, I’d say about 25-50% from Middle Eastern countries are “radicalized” (unlike our awesome Muslim Americans) - they may not commit acts of terror but they are fine with the notion. Finally, if you read the whole article like I did, yes, white nationalists planned or carried out what, double or triple the amount of terrorist attacks? But you forgot to read the part where “Researchers said attacks in EU countries killed 68 victims and left 844 injured last year, with nearly all the reported fatalities and casualties resulting from jihadist atrocities.” And hell yeah you’re spot on that I’m retarded, I have Asperger’s syndrome. :)"
48,e5m3s99,"Radical Islam and terrorists who are part of the Islam faith is completely different than hating all of their religion. That would be like hating all Christianity because Westboro Baptists exist. I hear lots of Muslim hating disgusting comments from the right that seem to ignore the fact that almost all Muslim Americans are great and fairly kind people. I live near a large Muslim population, I teach their children, I go to college with them. The hate I hear from White conservatives about their religion pisses me off. I don't claim to know what makes terrorists commit their crimes. Maybe it is because the US has a poor track record of damaging their countries. I also don't know why conservatives act like a bunch of xenophobic bigots all the time. Maybe it's a similar reason. Like all humans have more in common than we care to believe..."

51,e3erp8b,"*Is Jeremy Corbyn an ""existential threat"" to ""Jewish life"" in the UK? That was the rather extraordinary claim made in an unprecedented joint editorial published on the front pages of Britain’s three leading Jewish newspapers last week.*

*In fact, it wasn’t just extraordinary: it was hysterical, offensive and plain wrong. Do you want to know what an ""existential threat"" to a minority community really looks like? Come to the United States, where I’ve lived since 2015.*

*Donald Trump has suggested Muslim Americans are complicit in terrorist attacks; claimed ""Islam hates us""; introduced a ""Muslim ban""; and appointed dozens of anti-Muslim bigots to his administration.*

*Corbyn, of course, has neither said nor done anything comparable in relation to Britain’s Jews. Has he been slow to take action against a handful of anti-Semites inside his party? Yes.*

*Does he suffer from an ""unconscious bias"" on the left that doesn’t take allegations of anti-Semitism as seriously as it takes allegations of, say, Islamophobia? Probably.*

*Could he have been more forceful and proactive in denouncing left-wing anti-Semitism much earlier on? Definitely.*

*But does a Corbyn-led Labour government pose a threat to the very existence of British Jewry? Don’t. Be. Silly.*

*Again, that is not to say that there isn’t a problem of anti-Semitism on the left. The very next day after the joint editorial was published, a Labour councillor was suspended from the party after a post on his Facebook page called Jews blood-sucking ""parasites.""* 

*Earlier this week, a recording emerged of Peter Willsman, a Corbyn ally and member of Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC), angrily accusing Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" of fabricating evidence of anti-Semitism.*

*This is absurd. Even Momentum, the pro-Corbyn grassroots movement, has acknowledged ""the anger, upset and despair within the British Jewish community at the numerous cases of anti-Semitism in the Labour party"" and said they ""should not and cannot be dismissed simply as rightwing smears nor as the result of conspiracies.""*

*Depressingly, the row over anti-Semitism in Labour has lost all sense of proportion and nuance; on the one side, those who cynically claim Corbyn is an ""existential threat"" to Jews and, on the other, those who shamefully claim allegations of anti-Semitism have been ""stirred up"" only to attack Corbyn and defend Israel.* 

*Yet there is no need to choose sides: you can commit to both defeating anti-Semitism and electing a Corbyn-led government. You can strive to protect both Jews and criticism of Israel.*

*How so?*

*First, listen to the victims of racism; in this case, the Jewish victims of racism. That three Jewish Labour MPs had to stand up in the House of Commons and recount the anti-Semitic abuse they were subjected to online, while complaining that they felt abandoned by their party, should be a source of shame for Labour.*

*So too should the fact that almost eight out of 10 Labour members say they think anti-Semitism allegations have been exaggerated to damage Corbyn. To quote my friend Rachel Shabi, a Corbyn-supporting Jewish journalist, ""the number of peopleso doggedly telling Jewish people that they’re wrong about anti-Semitism"" is ""jaw-dropping.""* 

*When Jews say they’re the victims of racism, believe them.*

*Second, however, don’t listen to the right wing press. Are we expected to believe that conservative media outlets in the UK give a damn about anti-Semitism? The Daily Telegraph, which repeated far-right smears against George Soros on its front page? The Daily Mail, which published a now-notorious attack on Jewish refugee Ralph Miliband, father of Ed? LBC, which continues to employ former UKIP leader Nigel Farage as a presenter despite his on-air references to the ""money and influence"" of the ""Jewish lobby""?*

*There is no contradiction: it is perfectly possible to acknowledge that Labour has an anti-Semitism problem while also pointing out that these particular media outlets have weaponized anti-Semitism to try and smear and discredit Corbyn.*

*Third, don’t lose sight of the bigger threat. How can Jews feel safe in a Europe in which the far right is on the march?

52,e3ewx4x,"Article:

Is Jeremy Corbyn an ""existential threat"" to ""Jewish life"" in the UK? That was the rather extraordinary claim made in an unprecedented joint editorial published on the front pages of Britain’s three leading Jewish newspapers last week.

In fact, it wasn’t just extraordinary: it was hysterical, offensive and plain wrong. Do you want to know what an ""existential threat"" to a minority community really looks like? Come to the United States, where I’ve lived since 2015.

Donald Trump has suggested Muslim Americans are complicit in terrorist attacks; claimed ""Islam hates us""; introduced a ""Muslim ban""; and appointed dozens of anti-Muslim bigots to his administration.

Corbyn, of course, has neither said nor done anything comparable in relation to Britain’s Jews. Has he been slow to take action against a handful of anti-Semites inside his party? Yes.






Does he suffer from an ""unconscious bias"" on the left that doesn’t take allegations of anti-Semitism as seriously as it takes allegations of, say, Islamophobia? Probably.

Could he have been more forceful and proactive in denouncing left-wing anti-Semitism much earlier on? Definitely.

But does a Corbyn-led Labour government pose a threat to the very existence of British Jewry? Don’t. Be. Silly.

Again, that is not to say that there isn’t a problem of anti-Semitism on the left. The very next day after the joint editorial was published, a Labour councillor was suspended from the party after a post on his Facebook page called Jews blood-sucking ""parasites."" 

Earlier this week, a recording emerged of Peter Willsman, a Corbyn ally and member of Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC), angrily accusing Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" of fabricating evidence of anti-Semitism.

This is absurd. Even Momentum, the pro-Corbyn grassroots movement, has acknowledged ""the anger, upset and despair within the British Jewish community at the numerous cases of anti-Semitism in the Labour party"" and said they ""should not and cannot be dismissed simply as rightwing smears nor as the result of conspiracies.""

Depressingly, the row over anti-Semitism in Labour has lost all sense of proportion and nuance; on the one side, those who cynically claim Corbyn is an ""existential threat"" to Jews and, on the other, those who shamefully claim allegations of anti-Semitism have been ""stirred up"" only to attack Corbyn and defend Israel. 

Yet there is no need to choose sides: you can commit to both defeating anti-Semitism and electing a Corbyn-led government. You can strive to protect both Jews and criticism of Israel.

How so?

First, listen to the victims of racism; in this case, the Jewish victims of racism. That three Jewish Labour MPs had to stand up in the House of Commons and recount the anti-Semitic abuse they were subjected to online, while complaining that they felt abandoned by their party, should be a source of shame for Labour.

So too should the fact that almost eight out of 10 Labour members say they think anti-Semitism allegations have been exaggerated to damage Corbyn. To quote my friend Rachel Shabi, a Corbyn-supporting Jewish journalist, ""the number of peopleso doggedly telling Jewish people that they’re wrong about anti-Semitism"" is ""jaw-dropping."" 

When Jews say they’re the victims of racism, believe them.

Second, however, don’t listen to the right wing press. Are we expected to believe that conservative media outlets in the UK give a damn about anti-Semitism? The Daily Telegraph, which repeated far-right smears against George Soros on its front page? The Daily Mail, which published a now-notorious attack on Jewish refugee Ralph Miliband, father of Ed? LBC, which continues to employ former UKIP leader Nigel Farage as a presenter despite his on-air references to the ""money and influence"" of the ""Jewish lobby""?

There is no contradiction: it is perfectly possible to acknowledge that Labour has an anti-Semitism problem while also pointing out that these particular media outlets have weaponized anti-Semitism to try and smear and discredit Corbyn.

Third, don’t lose sight of the bigger threat. How can Jews feel safe in a Europe in which the far right is on the march? Go to Poland, where the government has passed a law denying any Polish complicity in the Holocaust; or go to Austria, where there is a proposal to force Jews to obtain permits to buy kosher meat. In Germany, police statistics attributed  nine out of 10 anti-Semitic crimes in 2017 to ""members of far-right or neo-Nazi groups.""

The feelings of Jews matter - but facts matter, too. ""Existential"" threats to minority communities in Europe - whether Jewish, Muslim, gay or Roma - come from the far right, not the far left.

Fourth, stop conflating Jews and Israel. This point applies as much to defenders of the Jewish state as it does to anti-Semitic bigots. The joint editorial in those three papers lambasted Labour for making a (false) distinction between ""racial anti-Semitism"" and ""political anti-Semitism targeting Israel.""

53,e3pqje9,"I would not argue in favor of committing hate crimes. I'm arguing for apathy about the level of hate crimes. It is difficult to educate absolutely everybody about how to behave. Some people are just disgusting brutes, especially when they are drunk or intoxicated. Only [1/1000 Americans are the victim of a hate crime](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcv0415.pdf) in any given year, which I think is pretty good considering.

[Most Americans do not think Muslims in the US are anti-American](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/21/anti-muslim-assaults-reach-911-era-levels-fbi-data-show/), and the vast majority of those who do blame Muslim-Americans won't commit hate crimes against them. So perpetrators of hate crimes against Muslims and Sikhs are a minority of a minority, but there are 300 million people in America so there will be a few.

Indeed there have been nearly a thousand hate crimes against Muslims in the US since 9/11 - out of a Muslim-American population of ~2.5 million people. So Muslims are victims of hate crimes at *less* than the basal rate for all Americans. It may suck to be a Muslim in post-9/11 America but it's still better than being Black or Jewish or LGBT or some other target of hate apparently.

And I've kind of been dancing around it, but 3,000 Americans were killed on 9/11 by a radical Sunni terrorist group funded largely by Sunni Arabs. They killed a few thousand of us and we beat up a few hundred of them, but I'm supposed to grovel in shame? Sure, us-vs-them thinking isn't very sophisticated, and group punishment is largely going to target the innocent, but in a crisis it is the natural form to which we humans revert. It's not exactly about to disappear. There's only so much moral outrage I can muster when it happens.

I think we Americans should be proud of how *few* Muslim-Americans are the victims of hate crimes rather than endlessly flagellating ourselves over how many are victimized."
54,e43j9np,"So, Muslim Americans are all terrorists, eh?

Seriously, I don't see why people equate Muslim EXTREMISTS with Islam as a faith. They are, by definition, **extremists** who hide behind religious texts to justify terror, hate, intolerance, etc.

If you don't think that a large portion of the country are white Christian extremists who seek to impose Christian law on the US (i.e. what anti-Muslim people claim will happen if we respect the right to practice Islam), you're sorely mistaken."
55,e1g30iz,"&gt;\&gt;We're talking about the current ban, not the proposed or older version of it and debating if it is constiutional or not. You keep claiming that their is an ""uncostitutional animus"" to the Order, but there is not as it's current state is perfectly constitutional, as per the court's ruling. You keep going on about Trump's intent (Something I find rather silly to focus on when discussing a non-criminal court case), and claim it is due to an anti-muslim bias. This is not the case either. The countries listed each have a history of human rights abuses, hostility towards the U.S. and unstable governments. All the nations included in the ban have these factors in common. This is why the current ban cannot and should not be described as a ""muslim ban"" because Islam is not the key factor in the order.

Alright lets go back to what makes an executive order constitutional or not, ""An executive order has an ""unconstitutional animus"" when it has the “purpose and effect of disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state law"" (Justice Kennedy in the majority opinion for US v. Windsor).""

Moving on, lets look at the facts about this executive order.  The original order included a ban on seven majority Muslim countries--Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. During the campaign Trump referred to the ban as Muslim ban and on his site was written, ""Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"".  Obviously this is not what happened, but this was how Trump framed the ban originally.  After mass protest and a legal ruling against the ban he changed some of the wording and added two non-Muslim countries as a kind of window dressing, and removed Iraq and Sudan.  Before you say the original order is irrelevant, it's really not.  It's important for determining Trump's intent, and yes the intent does matter even in a non-criminal case because an executive order is unconstitutional when it not only has the effect of disapproval of a legally recognized class, but also the **purpose**.

You argue that the motivation for the ban is that ""The countries listed each have a history of human rights abuses, hostility towards the U.S. and unstable governments.""  If this is the case why would Trump implement a complete immigration ban, including refugees?  If anything that punishes the victims of human rights abuses more than it does the governments, and does nothing to lessen hostilities.  Given this, I still lack any explanation for the ban.  What we do know is that Trump has expressed many anti-Muslim sentiments; he once for example talked about kicking out all Syrian refugees suggesting that they might be a secret army, and has also flirted with the idea of closing down mosques.

**Taken all together, we have a ban that Trump previously called a ""Muslim ban"", that primarily targets Muslim-majority countries, that punishes vast swaths of people for no apparent reason, we have a stated explanation that makes no sense, we have Trump's history of anti-Muslim statements, and lastly further mystifying Trump’s motivation is the fact that we already had a working two year immigration process with background checks. If the motivation isn't some kind of misinformed mistrust of Muslim immigrants, please tell me what it is because it defies rational explanation.  Back to the original question, though, an executive order is unconstitutional if it ""has the purpose and effect of disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state law"".  Muslim Americans are legally recognized.  Given all of the information listed above, by implementing a complete ban on immigration, and taken in conjunction with Trump’s stereotypical rhetoric about Muslims, it becomes clear that the ban lumps all Muslim immigrants together as a danger or threat to our country, even though all evidence points to the opposite.  For American Muslims this has the effect of spreading the message that they’re viewed with suspicion by the American government.  One could say it has the effect of “disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state law”.**

&gt;\&gt;This is only terrorism convicitons. How many other crimes have been commited by immigrants and refugees from these countries?

Couldn't find any data from these specific countries, however on average legal immigrants are many times less likely to commit a crime than native born persons - [https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EIFxSrjvPFYrmKXBSqa4-JIoGl4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XATRA3VTXI7VZL2PBK7ZCDLNEA.png](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EIFxSrjvPFYrmKXBSqa4-JIoGl4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XATRA3VTXI7VZL2PBK7ZCDLNEA.png)

And if we're just looking at refugees, zero refugees from any of the countries on the travel ban have ever killed an American in a terrorist attack.  Source: [https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/politics/immigration-stats-by-the-numbers-trnd/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/politics/immigration-stats-by-the-numbers-trnd/index.html)

This makes Trump's decision to ban not only immigration but also refugees from these countries even more baffling if not cruel.  There is no rational motivation for this decision, and given Trump's many anti-Muslim comments ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/20/i-think-islam-hates-us-a-timeline-of-trumps-comments-about-islam-and-muslims/?noredirect=on&amp;utm\_term=.fdfe82ecdb6e](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/20/i-think-islam-hates-us-a-timeline-of-trumps-comments-about-islam-and-muslims/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.fdfe82ecdb6e)) I can see no other motivation for this decision other than some sort of misguided animus."
56,e1rh6un,"I think it’s absolutely possibly to be racist to whites people and it happens quite a bit but I think his comparison is flawed because they’re no where equal. The term “sounds about white” tends to be used the most during a mass shooting by a white person. He’s trying to compare it to ideas such as “all middle easterns are terrorists” or “black men are criminals”. And say they’re similarly racist. When a Middle Eastern commits an act of terrorism, racist laws are enacted, banning them from coming to the country, profiling at airports, hate crimes against not only them, but people like Sikhs that look like them, etc. When a black man commits a crime, the country uses it to justify police profiling, mass incarceration, etc. When a white man commits a mass shooting, not only do they not make laws against whites people, they don’t even make laws on the guns they use. On the other hand, one Muslim brings a bomb in a water bottle or a shoe, not only does the US ban Muslims, but it bans water bottles and shoes too. 

Look, I’m not trying to say “sounds about white” is a pleasant thing to say. Or that it should be said. And I definitely agree that white people can be subject, and quite often, to racism. But I think the saying is often used in frustration or irony in relation to how minorities are treated when there are similar incidents. When a white mass shooter is called a troubled person or a lone wolf, it’s usually true. If they aren’t, they’re always radicalized by a very, small, very extreme minority of white people. But people are upset because this basic common sense thinking is only extended to white mass shooters. Black and Muslim Americans are frustrated that they have to take responsibility for the actions of every bad Muslim or Black person that does something bad, while white people can distance themselves from these mass shooters. In a perfect world, neither white, black or Muslim would have to be accountable of the actions of someone they have never seen, met or agree with, but that unfortunately is not the case, and saying “sounds about white” is just a byproduct of a greater racial issue for us to consider. I don’t think most people who use the term “sounds about white” actually think being white caused the mass shooting., but rather in jest. The thing is, I think when people say “Muslims are terrorists” or “black people are criminals” they believe being Muslim or black is the reason why they are terrorists or criminals. 

I appreciate OP’s attempt to empathize with another race’s experience, especially one that is often demonized, but no matter his race, I think his argument misses an opportunity to actually address some of the discrimination that white people face. It feels contrarian, especially with him using his race as an authority on the topic. "
57,dxthx5t,"&gt; Until you acknowledge there is a difference between 'this lead to rape' and 'this justified the rape', what is the actual point here?

There is a difference. The difference is that you're using one to obscure and smoke-screen for the other.

Observe as I reply to you in this thread.

&gt; In the Inquiry into the Rotherham case, they specifically talk about how racism inhibited action.

I assume you're talking about [this inquiry report](https://www.rotherham.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1407/independent_inquiry_cse_in_rotherham.pdf). In it, it claims:

*She also reported in 2006 that young people in Rotherham believed at that time that the Police dared not act against Asian youths for fear of allegations of racism.*

I can definitely acknowledge that ""the police would not do anything against the rapists for fear of being labeled racist"" is a *factor* that encouraged this. However, it is worth pointing out, that in doing so, this comes with an acknowledgement that maybe we, as a society, are too quick to apply the label ""racist"" and treat it too seriously.

&gt; Likewise, in the ""Children’s Commissioner’s Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Gangs and Groups"", they talk specifically about how younger members are initiated by older ones. That is grooming, even if it does not involve the act of sexual abuse itself.

In fact, [this has been corroborated by survivors testimony who verify that older members initiated younger ones](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rotherham-grooming-gang-sexual-abuse-muslim-islamist-racism-white-girls-religious-extremism-a8261831.html).

And *how* did they initiate them, I wonder? What arguments did they use to initiate young people?

From the article:

*Like terrorists, they firmly believe that the crimes they carry out are justified by their religious beliefs.* ... *“Muslim girls are good and pure because they dress modestly, covering down to their ankles and wrists, and covering their crotch area. They stay virgins until marriage. They are our girls.* ... *White girls and non-Muslim girls are bad because you dress like slags. You show the curves of your bodies (showing the gap between your thighs means you’re asking for it) and therefore you’re immoral. White girls sleep with hundreds of men. You are the other girls. You are worthless and you deserve to be gang-raped.”* ... *My main perpetrator quoted scriptures from the Quran to me as he beat me.*

They leveraged the religion and its commandments. They leveraged the culture around it. They literally quoted their holy book as justification for what they did.

Without this, they had nothing. No justifications. Everything they did, every act they did, every factor only aids to support the main central column of the sexual abuse: that the religion permitted it and encouraged it.

That's the core of this issue.

&gt;Your claim that Muslims commit all the rape and basically nobody else does is not supported by the numbers at all.

I...

Okay.

I understand how you say this. I apologize for getting angry and becoming unclear; I explained why I was angry.

To clarify, what I'm saying, is that when assessed on a per-capita basis, Muslims commit more rape than non-Muslims overall, and worldwide. Further, when it comes to specific locations where Muslims live alongside non-Muslims, the kinds of rape that are perpetuated -- against young girls, racially motivated gang rapes especially against white girls -- are perpetuated massively, disproportionately, by Muslims versus non-Muslims.

The statistics support this. Worldwide. In every situation excluding some edge cases (such as Ahmedyya Muslims, who are hated and persecuted by all other Muslim groups).

&gt;But certainly they are over-represented.

Then, sure. We agree.

&gt; Could the specific culture or religion be a factor in why they are able to operate in groups, rather than solitary offenders? Sure, you are probably more likely to be able to communicate and access other abusers without getting reported to the police, given the conservatism and closeness of their communities.

I agree, to the extent that it is more than a factor and is, in fact, the major and prime motivating factor and that it is the sole factor that, if removed, would curtail the abuse down to ""barely statistically significant"" levels.

&gt;Could it play a role in the hatred shown towards the victims? Definitely.

Considering, as I discussed above, the purpetrators *literally* justified their behaviour both to themselves and to ""newcomers"" under religious grounds and *explicitly* quoted the Quran towards those they abused as justifications for that abuse, then yes, I would think it would play a *significant* role, and was, in fact, the major factor involved.

&gt;But to chalk it up to Islam solely is to basically parrot the abusers as they attempt to absolve themselves of their crimes.

No.

As I've said, I acknowledge there were other factors that *enabled* them, but the core of the act was motivated by, justified by, excused by, and actively encouraged by, the religious views and cultures of the people involved. Everything else merely served to help convince other purpetrators and victims that the abuse was justified.

&gt;The abusers may attempt to give an Islamic justification, but abusers of all kinds find creative ways of saying that the victims were 'asking for it'.

Sure. But Islam provides an *extremely* convenient one that is *extremely* compelling to a believer.

The perfect man purchased his six year old wife from a neighboring tribe and consummated that wedding when she was 9. The perfect man slaughtered a village so he could take a single woman as another of his wives, a woman who, on their first night as a ""married"" coupled, tried to poison him (showing she was NOT on board with this plan). The perfect man raped his way, Genghis Khan style, across the whole of the Middle East, killing and raping and killing and raping and killing and raping. And he was the perfect man, for all Muslims to emulate.

That is an extremely convenient excuse.

&gt; The idea that these people, otherwise involved in drug trafficking, prostitution, drinking and abortion, were really motivated by the precepts of Islam stretches credibility.

Religious people, even and especially extremely religious people, pick and choose the parts of their religion that they like and want to follow, and ignore the rest. News at 11.

The 9/11 Hijackers smoke and drank and fucked and did drugs. Were they ""not real Muslims""?

I mean, let's flip this around. The Crusaders killed people. The Christian God commanded Christians not to kill. Were the Crusaders not motivated by Christianity?

Just because a religious person doesn't follow *all* parts of their religion doesn't mean they aren't ""really"" that.

&gt;The social and economic conditions that the groups exist in is surely worth considering when you look at the type of offenders they are.

I'm more than happy to consider it, but it is far from the major factor given, as I said, that the exact same social and economic conditions do not affect Sikhs in the same way.

&gt;Why is it almost exclusively Northern towns?

Because that is where the Muslims *are*?

[Here is a heat-map of the distribution of ethnicities of the UK (one dot per person)](http://projects.andrewwhitby.com/uk-ethnicity-map/). The areas where the abuses took place are areas where there are high amounts of Asian and Black people. If you tick the ""Show Map Labels"" button you'll see, well, that they basically align perfectly.

There are no Muslim sex gangs in Belfast because there are no Muslims there. There are no Muslim sex gangs in Blyth because there are no Muslims in Blyth. There are no Muslim sex gangs in Washington because there are no Muslims in Washington.

&gt;Other groups, at least minority groups, don't exist in the same numbers, in the same concentrations, in the same economic distribution, in the same locations, with the same degree of discrimination. Their parallel societies, where they do exist, do not exist in anywhere the same size or degree.

Well, then we must ask the question: why is this so?

Why do Sikhs not band together in this way?

Why do Poles not band together in this way?

Why do French not band together in this way?

Why do only Muslims make the choice to form these kinds of parallel societies, and why is it that everyone else can integrate despite country of origin, belief system, culture, religion, skin colour, etc etc etc, but only Muslims are the ""perfect storm"" of conditions that make this happen?

Or... maybe there is something about Islam that makes this much more likely?

&gt; When 99.99% of people with a trait don't do something - it's not a good predictor for that behaviour. 

The vast majority of men do not commit rape. This doesn't mean that we should treat men and women as being equally likely to commit rape.

&gt;There is no simple link for child abuse, across every community it is abhorred and perpetrated by an extreme minority.

Of course there is no direct causal link.

But there are *factors* and the biggest and greatest factor seems to be ""be a Muslim"".

Of *course* not every Muslim is a rapist. Not even most.

But when all other things are equal, the biggest and most significant *factor* that leads to one being a rapist is being a Muslim. There are plenty of white Britons who are exposed to the same factors who do not rape. There are plenty of Sikhs who receive significant social discrimination and poverty and every other factor you listed who do not rape. There are Poles who are poor and working class and who struggle to fit into a society that doesn't respect them or speak their language and yet they do not rape. Every other group -- EVERY other group -- does not rape. Not like Muslims do. EVERY single one. 
Why do you put so much effort into defending this extremely horrible religion and the things it does?
"
58,dxvrdjm,"did everyone who died on 9/11 spring back to life? Doing any policy analysis on terrorism and choosing to arbitrarily exclude the single most important terrorist event in US history of the past few decades would make any analysis unrealistic.

Even if we were to exclude 9/11 and the oklahoma city bombings in order to produce those meaningless statistics, the rate of representation would still be 30x the rate for muslims compared to non-hispanic whites.

&gt;Also FYI Muslim Americans are rarely the ones carrying out the attacks, so using the population state for American Muslims is also bad statistics since they aren't the whole pool

Those demographics are based on the population, not just the citizens. No terrorist attacks have been carried out in the united states by someone who isn't in the united states.
"
59,dxwi2xs,"Alright as I see I’ve generated a big reaction over this, let me attempt to explain what I mean. If you still disagree with me feel free to call me out on it! 
First off, it’s undeniable true that there is a problem within Islam. Most of the countries that impose restrictions on freedom of religion are [Islamic ](http://www.pewforum.org/files/2014/01/RestrictionsV-full-report.pdf) Of the countries that outlaw blasphemy all are [Muslim majority:](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/29/which-countries-still-outlaw-apostasy-and-blasphemy/) So, its entirely true that their is a problem within Islam, but that doesn’t mean that Islam is an inherently violent religion. That’s the important distinction here. 

If Islam was inherently violent, then it should always have been an outlier as far as violence goes correct? But when we take a look at the history of the Islamic world, while we do find many centuries of war, we also find centuries of relative peace. Islam has at times been the center of peace and modernity in the world, with things such as algebra coming from this region, and leading the world in the understanding of medicine. In fact, there were more then a million [Jews living ](https://iis.ac.uk/academic-article/muslim-jews-and-christians-relations-and-interactions) within the Arab world up until the 1950’s. In fact, there are plenty of times throughout history where the Arab world were more tolerant towards the Jewish people then the [Christian world ](https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/20070119-persecution.pdf) world was! ( [Here is some more reading ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_and_the_Crusades) (there’s also a really good book about this called “Peace be upon you : 14 centuries of Muslim, Christian, and Jewish conflict and cooperation” by Zachary Karabell)

Also, if Islam is so violent what makes it violent? It’s holy book contains passages of violence, but then again so does the Bible. Leviticus 20:10 recommends that adulterers should be put to death. Leviticus 24:16 says Blasphemers should be put to death. So if the Bible also contains violent passages, and Christians also have a history of violence (Crusades, inquisitions, schisms, and burning) towards nonbelievers, what could explain the current intolerance within the Islamic world?

The root of the problem is [political stagnation ](http://www.newsweek.com/politics-rage-why-do-they-hate-us-154345) (as an aside, I’d highly recommend reading this article. It’s the best one there is over this topic) Basically, there has been a complete collapse of civil institutions within the Arab world, with strongmen seizing control of various countries and outlawing dissent of any kind.  Over decades, Islam became the language of political dissent, as it was the one thing the dictators couldn’t outlaw. This led to a deep radicalization of the Arab world. (Before you disagree, please read the article, it’s fantastic though I don’t have the time to give a detailed summary of it)

So while it’s absolutely true that their are deep problems within the Arab world, and hence in Islam (anyone who denies that is lying) perhaps things aren’t as dark as we commonly think. The Islamic world is [significantly opposed to Isis ](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/17/in-nations-with-significant-muslim-populations-much-disdain-for-isis/) American Muslims are increasingly accepting of [homosexuality ](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/political-and-social-views/) , only slightly less then the population overall. Muslims are mostly [opposed to suicide bombing ](http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/pg-2014-07-01-islamic-extremism-10/)  (though some countries are alarmingly high) Muslim Americans are more likely than the general public to say targeting and killing civilians is [never justified ](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/terrorism-and-concerns-about-extremism/)  

Indeed, by casting a blanket condemnation on the Islamic world, and by portraying our war with terrorists as a clash of civilizations we are doing our enemies job for them. We can [not allow](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/01/512890402/petraeus-warns-of-giving-ammunition-to-extremists-revisionist-powers) ourselves to fall for the easy path of blaming an entire religion for its lost extreme elements. All this does is marginalize Islamic communities within our country, who are our [greatest ally](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/david-petraeus-anti-muslim-bigotry-aids-islamist-terrorists/2016/05/12/5ab50740-16aa-11e6-924d-838753295f9a_story.html?utm_term=.222908cd649e)  in our war against extremism. 

Edit: if nothing else read the article over politic stagnation in the Arab world. You owe it to yourself. Even if you completely disagree with everything I wrote at the very least you’ll be more familiar with opposing viewpoints and will be better able to combat them in the future."
60,dy2slz2,"&gt; Maybe this is the case in the US, but for Europe and the islamic world I disagree with the premise.

If you're a Turk living in Berlin or an Algerian living in Paris you face infinitely more discrimination than European natives do from Muslims. It's rather uninformed to claim otherwise. The same is true in the US. Even Sikh temples have been attacked by terrorists who thought they were Muslims. 

&gt; The effect of US politics is heavily up-played in attempts to explain islamic dysfunction to the point of absurdity, and Sam is accurate in his corrections.

I'm sorry, but this is an incredibly privileged perspective. Muslim Americans are being bashed by the President of their own country. "
61,dyc5m5a,"&gt; The point is that if there is a population of Muslims anywhere that are capable of holding extremely progressive values that means that their Muslimness has nothing to do with the values they are capable of holding.

That's not a good point it seems to me because it assumes what it sets out to prove. Finding a progressive community of muslims does not negate a negative influence of Islam because it's consistent with progressivism despite islam and not because of islam/islam has no influence on the matter. It would only be a point against someone who literally believes that in a group of 1,3 billion where there's a general trend of antiprogressivism there's not enough progressive individuals *for whatever reason* that if they were all brought into one place they'd be sufficient enough in size and time spent together so as to be considered a ""community"". I doubt many people here believe that.

&gt; A lot of posters in here like to say that Muslim Americans are better off financially then their European counterparts and that can explain their more progressive views. 

That's certainly part of the story. But it's not just about having money which seems to be what you're implying, it's probably also due to personality differences between people who become economically succesful in a secular environment and those who don't. There's a number of reasons why one would assume muslims with higher human capital would be more progressive on average, because it correlates with metrics that progressive people score high on. Openess being one, lower rates of fundamentalism being another (no this isnt incompatible with the datapoint that many terrorists are well-educated). 

&gt; Well then, that means we should work to improve the economic standing of European Muslims and refugees, right?

I live in northern Europe. Trying to improve the economic standings of our low human capital immigrants is something we've tried doing and spent billions and billions and billions on that goal and we've done so for decades. It's been somewhat effective in that these people would've been way way worse off wihout those measures, but it's also been an absolute failure in that not only do these groups fare consistently and significantly worse despite a myriad of attempts at closing the gap, in terms of attitudes things do not seem to be getting better but possibly even worse (largely due to mass immigration, you can't fix a leak if you let someone drill into the hole from the other side while you're trying to patch it). Because of this, attitudes towards immigration in general are spiralling down, a majority of Swedes now want to (massively) reduce immigration. And who could blame them? Turns out elite cartells pushing for policies without good support among the population and using lies for this agenda (""it's good for the economy"" despite zero evidence for the proposition any many studies showing the opposite, being one of many) has serious potential for backlash. Who could've guessed.

And so I absolutely reject your characterization of Europe as if this hasn't been attempted. Billions and billions and billions have been spent just on that.

&gt; It doesn't mean that their views are not compatible with Western Civilization™

Actually it does mean precisely that (depending on what one means with ""western civilization"" of course) but it doesn't mean that their views are impossible to change. It means very little on its own, and in reality we have no way of knowing what the future of Europe if the representation of Islam keeps increasing will be like. Hopefully things go the way of christianity, but there's absolutely no guarantee of that and many reasons to be cautious of that assumption. The boat that is Europe will now have to find its way between Schylla and Charybdis, Islamism and the far right. No guarantees."

&gt; #What do Muslims around the world believe?
&gt;
&gt; Like any religious group, the religious beliefs and practices of Muslims vary depending on many factors, including where in the world they live. But Muslims around the world are almost universally united by a belief in one God and the Prophet Muhammad, and the practice of certain religious rituals, such as fasting during Ramadan, is widespread.
&gt; 
&gt; In other areas, however, there is less unity. For instance, **a Pew Research Center survey of Muslims in 39 countries asked Muslims whether they want sharia law, a legal code based on the Quran and other Islamic scripture, to be the official law of the land in their country. Responses on this question vary widely. Nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99%) and most in Iraq (91%) and Pakistan (84%) support sharia law as official law. But in some other countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia – including Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%) and Azerbaijan (8%) – relatively few favor the implementation of sharia law.**
&gt;
&gt; #How do Muslims feel about groups like ISIS?
&gt; 
&gt; **Recent surveys show that most people in several countries with significant Muslim populations have an unfavorable view of ISIS, including virtually all respondents in Lebanon and 94% in Jordan. Relatively small shares say they see ISIS favorably. In some countries, considerable portions of the population do not offer an opinion about ISIS, including a majority (62%) of Pakistanis.**
&gt; 
&gt; Favorable views of ISIS are somewhat higher in Nigeria (14%) than most other nations. Among Nigerian Muslims, 20% say they see ISIS favorably (compared with 7% of Nigerian Christians). The Nigerian militant group Boko Haram, which has been conducting a terrorist campaign in the country for years, has sworn allegiance to ISIS.
&gt; 
&gt; **More generally, Muslims mostly say that suicide bombings and other forms of violence against civilians in the name of Islam are rarely or never justified, including 92% in Indonesia and 91% in Iraq. In the United States, a 2011 survey found that 86% of Muslims say such tactics are rarely or never justified. An additional 7% say suicide bombings are sometimes justified and 1% say they are often justified.**
&gt; 
&gt; In a few countries, a quarter or more of Muslims say these acts of violence are at least sometimes justified, including 40% in the Palestinian territories, 39% in Afghanistan, 29% in Egypt and 26% in Bangladesh.
&gt; 
&gt; **In many cases, people in countries with large Muslim populations are as concerned as Western nations about the threat of Islamic extremism, and have become increasingly concerned in recent years. About two-thirds of people in Nigeria (68%) and Lebanon (67%) said in 2016 that they are very concerned about Islamic extremism in their country, both up significantly since 2013.**
&gt; 
&gt; #What do American Muslims believe?
&gt; 
&gt; Our 2017 survey of U.S. Muslims finds that Muslims in the United States perceive a lot of discrimination against their religious group. Moreover, a solid majority of U.S. Muslims are leery of President Donald Trump and think their fellow Americans do not see Islam as part of mainstream U.S. society. At the same time, however, Muslim Americans overwhelmingly say they are proud to be Americans, believe that hard work generally brings success in this country and are satisfied with the way things are going in their own lives.
&gt; 
&gt; Half of Muslim Americans say it has become harder to be Muslim in the U.S. in recent years. And 48% say they have experienced at least one incident of discrimination in the past 12 months. But alongside these reports of discrimination, a similar – and growing – share (49%) of Muslim Americans say someone has expressed support for them because of their religion in the past year. And 55% think Americans in general are friendly toward U.S. Muslims, compared with just 14% who say they are unfriendly.
&gt; 
&gt; Living in a religiously pluralistic society, Muslim Americans are more likely than Muslims in many other largely Muslim-majority nations to have a lot of non-Muslim friends. Only about a third (36%) of U.S. Muslims say all or most of their close friends are also Muslims, compared with a global median of 95% in the 39 countries we surveyed.
&gt; 
&gt; Roughly two-thirds of U.S. Muslims (65%) say religion is very important in their lives. About six-in-ten (59%) report praying at least daily and 43% say they attend religious services at least weekly. By some of these traditional measures, Muslims in the U.S. are roughly as religious as U.S. Christians, although they are less religious than Muslims in many other nations.
&gt; 
&gt; **When it comes to political and social views, Muslims are far more likely to identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party (66%) than the Republican Party (13%) and to say they prefer a bigger government providing more services (67%) over a smaller government providing fewer services (25%). And about half of U.S. Muslims (52%) now say homosexuality should be accepted by society, up considerably from 2011 (39%) and 2007 (27%).**"
63,dx7kvl8,"&gt; This is isomorphic to instances of the mean of a series not necessarily falling near the median.

Heh, I just finished reading a book on this topic (Discrimination and Disparities by Thomas Sowell), so I would agree 100% with this. When we talk about statistical categories, we are almost *never* talking about any particular individual that falls within that category. There is no ""average Muslim"", ""average man"", ""average woman"", ""average Christian"", ""average atheist""...all these things are statistical inventions that would not map directly onto any one member of that group. This misunderstanding is actually one of the things that got Damore in so much trouble...he was talking about statistical averages (and clearly understood them, to the point where he had an *entire section* explaining this concept), but his critics took it to be a description of individuals within those groups.

That being said, you do run into a logistical problem if you discard all statistical data. It simply isn't possible to discuss group issues at the level of the individual, and statistical trends *do* have real-world consequences (often in far more dramatic fashion than you'd expect).

So while I agree with you that the ""average Muslim"" is necessarily going to be false when mapped to any particular Muslim, I'm not sure that means discussing averages and trends is inherently harmful or worthless. Likewise, beliefs and ideologies matter. Even if no individual believes 100% of the tenants of something, the belief still influences the behavior of individuals. Otherwise, there would be no reason to be concerned about racism, Nazism, communism, white supremacy, or other such ideologies, as the conceptual framework of these things virtually never maps onto the beliefs of any individual who believes in them. But you can be *damn* sure that a belief in say, white supremacy, has a very real effect on the actions of the believer.

&gt;I am at this point generally not confident that when people are discussing Islam (or Christianity, even), they are conscientious of what variants they are discussing and which communities they are including, or that they are conscientious of what those variants or communities even believe and practice. Hence you have someone in this thread saying: ""As long as they don't stick up for genital mutilation that islam [sic] requires,"" which is clear about neither what realization of Islam they are talking about, nor of the tenets of different, unique realizations of Islam.

Agreed, as I pointed out elsewhere in this thread on FGM and Islam. That being said, there is a very *strong* correlation between FGM and Islamic belief, both in areas that traditionally practiced FGM (mostly Africa) and places where Muslims have emigrated to (i.e. the Middle East and Europe). It is not merely coincidence that the vast majority of reported cases of FGM in Britain occur to Muslim girls, and while acknowledging that the *majority* of Muslims do not support such practices (if they did, it would be **far** more widespread than it is) is important, that doesn't change the reality that individual Muslim girls are being mutilated. And that behavior is *not* random.

&gt;I will also add - and perhaps this will be less politically agreeable to some here - that, in my experience, conservatives tend to say, ""well, that's not really Islam, because they Quran says otherwise, or this Imam on YouTube says otherwise,"" when confronted with myriad examples of moderate or liberal Muslims, and liberals more often than not tend so say, ""of course, some variants of Islam are backwards, but we shouldn't thus generalize about a billion people, many of whom are peaceful and reasonable,"" when confronted with examples of backwards Muslims. This may be subjective judgement on my part, but the first argument is just pulling a no-true-Scottsman or goalpost moving, and the latter argument is pragmatic and reasonable.

Categories only have meaning as long as there is some sort of reasonable coherence to them. If I said I was an atheist who believed in God, or a Christian that didn't believe Jesus was real, would you accept that my claim is simply a different variation on atheism or Christianity? Or would you, rightly in my view, criticize my position as not really be representative of the groups to which I claim to be? For a more political example, what if a feminist said they were against women having the right to vote? Would they really be a feminist, and would other feminists accept this claim?

These are kind of extreme examples, but I don't think that someone is calling out other people for not following the basic premises of their proclaimed position is automatically invalid. Now, there are plenty of conservatives who take this too far, most of whom have zero idea of what the actual theological beliefs of *any* form of Islam are. But if someone claimed to be Muslim and then said the Quran isn't the word of God, or didn't have to be followed, I think it's perfectly natural to challenge them on whether or not their beliefs are actually representative of ""Islam"" as a religious concept.

I think this is also important because there are plenty of Muslim apologists who lie about what is written in the Quran and about what is believed by Muslims worldwide to paint Islam in a better light. They know most people won't bother to follow up with actual evidence, such as reading the Quran or looking at polls of Muslims worldwide, and so they can deflect legitimate criticism of certain beliefs.

It's all too easy to then argue that we can completely ignore this Muslim feminist because her criticisms don't ""really"" apply to Islam. But doing so doesn't make the reality of hundreds of millions of Muslim women who are suffering under theocratic oppression any less real.

And as far as liberals taking a more pragmatic view, [I don't think this is accurate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vln9D81eO60). There are plenty of liberals that refuse to criticize even fundamentalist versions of Islam, or criticize *actual terrorists*. I don't see much functional difference between the conservative view that Islam is necessarily bad and the liberal view that Islam is necessarily good (\*cough\* religion of peace \*cough\*).

&gt;Are people really finding liberals or feminists saying, ""Islam, in all its forms, is entirely benign and has no issues?""

[Yes](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/03/sam-harris-muslim-animus) and [yes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/opinion/womens-march-progressives-hate.html). The problem isn't saying ""don't rush to hate a billion people;"" I've seen little evidence of widespread hatred of Muslims. Jews are still victims of *far* more hate crimes in the U.S. than Muslims, for example, including during the period after 2001, as are blacks. The problem is that liberals tend to shut down *any* criticism of Islam. You can look no farther than the disgusting attacks on Charlie Hebdo by many media outlets. Do you really believe that if a bunch of *Christians* had attacked a media outlet for disrespecting Jesus there would have been the same response? Yeah, right. There is no possible reality where that would have happened.

I don't have a problem with liberals saying ""don't hate a billion people for their religion."" I agree with this 100%. I *do* have a problem with liberals saying ""don't *criticize the ideas* of this religion, or behavior of it's adherents, or say that you don't think the hijab is liberating, etc."" And this is what the majority of the left tends to say when discussing Islam."
64,dx7y0wz,"&gt;It is not merely coincidence that the vast majority of reported cases of FGM in Britain occur to Muslim girls, and while acknowledging that the majority of Muslims do not support such practices (if they did, it would be far more widespread than it is) is important, that doesn't change the reality that individual Muslim girls are being mutilated. And that behavior is not random.

Right: the vast majority of Muslims don't practice FGM.  So if someone is going to make the argument that, ""it's an Islamic thing,"" then they had really better be ready to discuss different expressions of Islam.  I don't think saying, ""it's a serious issue associated strongly with this particular expression of Islam,"" is mutually exclusive to saying, ""it's not a fundamentally Islamic thing.""  (Neither do you, it seems).  

But a lot of people take, ""associated with some parts of Islam,"" or some news that would indicate such a thing, to mean, ""a fundamental part of Islam.""  And then people spread the latter notion around as the basic truth of the matter.  It's a virulent way of propagating ignorance, and I don't think it helps the matter.  

&gt;Categories only have meaning as long as there is some sort of reasonable coherence to them. 

I understand what you are saying with the paragraphs you began here, but we at least agree that the categorizations themselves are mutable to one degree or another over time, right?  That's precisely the reason I gave, ""no god but God and Mohamed is his prophet,"" or you give, ""Jesus,"" as the tell-tale, *immutable* tenets of Islam or Christianity respectively: these beliefs are so simple and core that they really are fundamental.  Most everything else *isn't*, though.  Obviously plenty has remained consistent; but other things have changed dramatically, and those things weren't necessarily predictably ""mutable"" or ""insignificant"" things from the outset.  Plenty of Christians (who I do think can still be called Christians) seldom or even never attend religious services, were never baptized, only believe in the Bible allegorically, and so on.  There might be a ""ship of Theseus"" situation with how much these things can change and still be called by the same name, but as long as it's about Jesus and Ten Commandments and the New Testament is important, there is at least a claim to Christianity.  So when you say...

&gt;If I said I was an atheist who believed in God, or a Christian that didn't believe Jesus was real, would you accept that my claim is simply a different variation on atheism or Christianity? Or would you, rightly in my view, criticize my position as not really be representative of the groups to which I claim to be? For a more political example, what if a feminist said they were against women having the right to vote? Would they really be a feminist, and would other feminists accept this claim?

Well, yeah, I mean, if you said you didn't believe in God, Jesus, or the Bible, then I agree: one would be right to dispute your claims of Christianity.  Same goes for the feminist in your example.  However, these lines are not drawn in stone, and arguments happen all the time.  There is a particular user who used to post on this sub (still does?) who calls herself a feminist but has, to many of us, laughably ""Red Pill Wives"" ideas about things.  And there are Christians who say that female Christian priests aren't really Christian, and there are Muslims (a whole lot of them) who adamantly argue that Shia Muslims aren't Muslims of any kind at all.    

So I do agree: any meaningful categorization does have to have some kind of coherence, but the degree of that necessitated coherence or the lines that define it can be and are argued all the time.  And the legitimately of those arguments can change: only centuries ago, rejecting the literal truth of Genesis could excommunicate you from the church; that is, you ceased to be a Christian, you became a heretic, and that passed for reasonable at the time.  Now, that's completely normal among ""Christians.""  The standards change, the lines change, and the category itself changes.  

The same will (hopefully) happen with Islam as it (hopefully) secularizes.  And I really think it will; I'm more concerned about how long or bloody that process will be.  

&gt;[T]here are plenty of Muslim apologists who lie about what is written in the Quran and about what is believed by Muslims worldwide to paint Islam in a better light. They know most people won't bother to follow up with actual evidence, such as reading the Quran or looking at polls of Muslims worldwide, and so they can deflect legitimate criticism of certain beliefs.

Indeed; though this is hardly unique to religion, let alone Islam specifically.  And when it is found in religion, it is sometimes part of ""how the category changes.""  That is, to use an example from above, the first priest who rejected the literal interpretation of Genesis might have become a heretic.  But after enough clergymen, scholars, and believers alike re-framed the Bible that way, it became a tolerated and eventually actively preached position of many parishes. 

Oh, and, when you say, ""polls of Muslims worldwide,"" I assume you are at least in part referencing the now infamous Pew research polls.  My usual response to that is that while some of the results certainly seem troubling, go look up similarly troubling questions but geared for and posed to Americans or even American Christian republicans, and you might get similarly troubling results.  In previous discussions about the topic, the example I reference is, ""do you think we should obliterate the entire middle east and all its people with nuclear weapons?""  Google a few examples of surveys on *that* matter, and the results are about as bad as anything the Pew polls indicate about Muslims as a whole.  

Unfortunately, it turns out that a massive number of people support barbarism or laughably regressive policy or even genocide when you ask it on an anonymous survey.    

And, beyond that, such sentiments *do* change.  Look at support for sodomy laws a few decades ago versus today; they've shifted dramatically, to the point where many young adults today see the opinions of their grandparents' generation on the matter as abhorrent, barbaric violations of human rights.               

&gt;And this is what the majority of the left tends to say when discussing Islam.

I suppose we've had different experiences.  I really see little of that, and when I *do* see it, it's heavily criticized from the left itself at least as much as from the right.  As the NYT article you cited puts it:

&gt;I am sure that Linda Sarsour, and perhaps the other leaders of the Women’s March, will block me for writing this. Maybe I’ll be accused of siding with the alt-right or tarred as Islamophobic. But what I stand against is embracing terrorists, disdaining independent feminist voices, hating on democracies and celebrating dictatorships. If that puts me beyond the pale of the progressive feminist movement in America right now, so be it.

I agree.  And while I do have one generally feminist friend who has defended Sarsour, she herself is Muslim, and not without a couple of serious biases or blind spots about such things, from my standpoint.  It's important to note that that same friend does, from what I can tell, a heck of a lot more work bringing feminism into Islam than vice versa, it seems - and I'd say that overall that's a net positive.  Anyways, I've seen other feminists firmly criticize her over that defense, and I'm inclined to think that if more feminists were simply exposed to the more objectionable things Sarsour (et al) have said or done, then they would not be very supportive.  

I'm pretty sure a discussion with my partner went like this...

Me: Hey, there's this Muslim feminist speaking at the Women's March-- 

Her: Oh cool.

Me: --who has said [insert some objectionable things Sarsour has said].

Her: Oh fuck, that's not cool at all.  This is bad.       

I could be wrong though, and just insulated in a bubble of leftists and centrists that includes a critical mass of dogma-critical, pro-secularization, pro-rationalism, progressively self-critical feminists?  That's entirely possible.       "
65,dwi8mpd,"I mean, sure, I was being facetious and you are right that far-right terrorism is an issue. But the narrative about ""white terrorism"" that has been pushed recently is divorced from reality and willfully ignorant of the existence of non-white mass murderers and terrorists.

For example: the Mother Jones dataset on mass shootings (generally considered to be the best data available) shows that about 70% of mass shooting perpetrators are white and this fact is commonly used to forward the narrative that a disproportionately large number of mass shooters are white, conveniently ignoring that this number is exactly in line with the demographics of the population as a whole. Meanwhile, Asian-Americans (which includes most Muslim-Americans) *are* disproportionately likely to be perpetrators of mass shootings and that fact is completely ignored."
66,dxh82u8,"Voter turnout was 58%.  Trump lost the popular vote: but garnered around 1/2 the vote (as did Clinton).

So yes, about 1/4 (27%) voted for the man.  You are correct up until this point...

I was not one of those.  (ie. I didn't vote for him)

What you seem to not understand is basic sampling theorem and statistics 101.  The voters who actually turn out are actually a good indication of the whole of the population.  

Pollsters have a pretty damn good indication of who will win each state by asking a few thousand people coming out of the polls.  We can use the actually election result to project across the population as a whole.  

White people are about 70% of the US population.  However, they commit about 50% of mass shootings and terrorist attacks.  They are actually under represented.  

It is hard to gauge the political leanings of these white men.  Some are firmly on the right.  Timothy McVeigh for example.  Others tend to sway in the breeze and follow various ideologies.  The latest florida killer had ties to both far right ideologies and also sympathized with ISIS.  

Muslim Americans are about .5 - 1% of the US population and commit about 40% of mass killing.  They are GROSSLY overrepresented.

Where you are completely correct is nearly ALL of the terrorists and mass killers are male.  They are 50% of the population: so you would expect them to commit 50% of these acts.  There is definitely a male problem here.

I often here feminists drone on about toxic masculinity-- in this case they may have a point.  Why are nearly ALL terrorists and mass killers men?

67,dxnwq2b,"Where to begin? The plot is that a radical group of Arabs are causing terrorism and being hidden by the Arab-American community at large? That Muslim-Americans are complicit? Worse, the film connected Islamic activities, like reciting from the Holy Quran, the ritual washing before prayer, and the call to prayer, with terrorism. Also, once again, it had Palestinian bad guys, and even worse, it showed Arab immigrants, a college professor, and Arab-American auto mechanics in Brooklyn as terrorists. The filmmakers said there’s a good guy Arab cob, but That really doesn't fix the problem; it's like saying Tonto was a moderating character in all the Lone Ranger movies where the Indians were the bad guys. It distorts what terrorists really do and conflates it with what ordinary Muslims do. In 1998, Arabs and Muslims demonstrated in front of movie theaters showing the film, and after watching it, I wouldn't blame them.

Of course it's super important to focus on the victims of grooming, but as these horror stories unravel, I also inadvertently think of the wives and other women around these men who might be trapped in controlling and abusive situations. I absolutely do not believe that misogyny can be contained to one group of women, no, it permeates everything and men just express it slightly differently.

&gt;They made it clear that because I was a non-Muslim, and not a virgin, and because I didn’t dress “modestly”, that they believed I deserved to be “punished”. They said I had to “obey” or be beaten.

Yeah, and none of these guys are fighting for women. The racists are fighting for themselves, to hate Muslims and immigrants, and the anti-fascist types do it because they hate the racists. I'm cynical about this and I think it figures that it doesn't help.
&gt;Like terrorists, they firmly believe that the crimes they carry out are justified by their religious beliefs.

Men will always justify their crimes one way or another.
&gt;If anything, rising anti-Muslim hate will probably make groomers stronger in their convictions, and drive ordinary young Muslim men towards fundamentalism, grooming gangs and terrorism. 

Perhaps. I can't say too much about this subject. But.... anti-Muslim hate also harms Muslim women. This piece treats it as though there're only Muslim men and abused (white/British) girls, I feel that it glosses over Muslim women and that doesn't sit right with me. Like, also, yeah you could make a point about radicalization and all that, but there's something so deeply, fundamentally *wrong* with these men, such a deep, profound misogyny, such a tremendous lack of respect for *any* women, and while we should prevent more radicalization, I'm also like... *For Goddess'  sake, someone do something for the women who're still left under these men's thumbs*. Maybe that will antagonize them more, I don't know, but the situation can't remain like this, the men who say and do these things are like 99,99% likely to be an abuser at home, too. And Muslim women will be hated by the right wing anyway, which is why I think it's so important that we look for avenues to open up this conversation among the Left and to start addressing the implications of all this. 

&gt;The camaraderie, protection, money, and kudos that these groups offer, makes them a strong pull for anyone. 

Yes, and the rape. Men bonding over their shared misogyny.
&gt;In November 2017, the Swedish government held a meeting where they stated that: “Sexual violence is being used as a tactic of terrorism”, and as such, it was recognised as a threat to Sweden’s national security.

This is kind of sad, isn't a massive rape problem on itself reason enough to call it a threat to national security? And it's being ''used as a tactic''-- perhaps, but it also counts as sexual terrorism *purely on itself* imo.

&gt;The link between terrorism and rape undertaken by Islamist gangs was not being ignored. They called for counter-extremism education. This sounds like a balanced and intelligent governmental response to me.

Yes, but... there're *huge* misogyny problems to unravel here as well. For Goddess' sake, let them stop hating women. If they manage to pull them away from extremism that's nice and all, but this HAS to change as well. Or at least help women from their communities, there's probably a MASSIVE rape crisis there as well, just hidden and tucked away, protected by ''marriage''.
&gt;“Muslim girls are good and pure because they dress modestly, covering down to their ankles and wrists, and covering their crotch area. They stay virgins until marriage. They are our girls.

Yes, possessiveness, control, Madonna-whore complex, pedestal, abuse. Notice how this quote erases girl's and women's humanity/personhood, instead of people, they're representatives of values, vehicles of the (male) family honor. 
&gt;""White girls and non-Muslim girls are bad because you dress like slags. You show the curves of your bodies (showing the gap between your thighs means you’re asking for it) and therefore you’re immoral. White girls sleep with hundreds of men. You are the other girls. You are worthless and you deserve to be gang-raped.”


Raging, frightening misogyny.
&gt;This hateful religious hypocrisy strikes people to their very core.

I'm not sure it's hypocrisy. This woman puts a lot of emphasis on religion, but I think that a large part of this is simple, visceral misogyny, and in a context of misogyny, this all makes sense. The shallow yet misogynistic lip-service to Muslim women's virtue and the out-and-overt honest misogyny aimed at non-Muslim women are 2 sides of the same deeply misogynistic coin.


&gt;My main perpetrator quoted scriptures from the Quran to me as he beat me. However, almost identical scriptures (about the stoning to death of virgins who don’t scream when they are raped) can also be found in the Bible.

So, she goes on for a while about the several religions. She doesn't want to incite any violence, it seems. So... we get to this:

&gt;As a Rotherham grooming gang survivor, I am told that both child protection services and the prosecution of offenders is improving in most areas. But frustratingly, prevention hasn’t really begun.


And please *please* prevent harm to women and girls who're around these men in the private sphere and under their control. I suspect that Rotherham (and other places where these things happened) also have a lot of silent victims, the aforementioned Muslim women who might have nowhere to go and are being erased or ignored. Again, this level of misogyny does NOT remain contained to just 1 type of woman.

&gt;Grooming gang crime is upheld by religious extremism. Like Sweden, we must officially recognise this, and work to curb extremist preaching, teach religious counter-narratives, give gendered extremism education and deliver quality relationships education, while learning the lessons from Prevent and Channel. We need a careful, considered approach that is respectful of the human rights of everyone.

Yes. Human rights are key. But always choose women over perpetrators."
69,dw5gzj7,"That's manipulating the facts to fit your narrative. 

First, Muslim Americans are 3% of the size of the white American population, and many of them are classified as ""white"" on the US census already.

Second, as people pedantically are pointing out above, mass shootings and the like don't fit the strict definition of terrorism, so that's skewing the data. Despite being about 2% of the population, Muslim Americans are less likely to be involved in mass shootings than white people and we are less likely to be arrested or charged with a crime. (Muslims in prison are higher than 2% due to the conversion rate in prison, which is why I use the stats of indictments instead).

We are also over 10% of the doctors in America, which also is a much better ""representative statistic"" but for some reason you ignore it and focus on the much much rarer stereotype of us being terrorists."
70,dsuzne2,"&gt;Absolutely. many Muslims in India used to follow Sufiism, which is abhorred by the Middle East. 

That was a very small fraction. If you see the population of Sufis in India, it was and has been very low. Sufis spreading Islam is a Western liberal academic narrative that seems to ignore the huge amount of temple destruction and the conversion by the sword events. No, calling out an inherent bias in the western narrative of Indian history is not anti-intellectual

&gt;The RSS brigade alienate Muslims and cause them to change their point of view. If you are inclusive, the chances of radicalisation are minimal. If you keep bullying people, they will get angry and retaliate or change their ideology.

Classic case of not knowing RSS ideology. ""Samskruti sabki ek chirantan, khoon ragon mein Hindu hain. Viraat saagar, samaaj apna, hum sabh iske bindu hain"" 
संस्कृती सबकी एक चिरंतन खून रगों मे हिंदु हैं
विराट सागर समाज अपना हम सब इसके बिंदू हैं
We are all Hindus, some of us have converted when the invaders came, but we are all of the same blood and brothers of the same society. That is what RSS ideology is. See an interview with Dattatreya Hosabale to truly understand the organisation. There were some Muslims and Christians who came to our Shakhas. None of us have any enmity with them. I sometimes wonder if you guys even know what goes on in a Shakha. Media people have been demonizing us for decades and they speak as if they're complete experts on us.

&gt;That is bullshit. But, yes, Saudi Arabia is trying to export their version of Wahhabism around the globe.

So we don't do anything about it? Why wouldn't they also seek to convert the world into a great Ummah through Love Jihad? Btw, the idea of an Ummah is unfortunately quite popular with South Asian Muslims as well. In addition, many Indian Muslim girls are also trafficked into the middle east. Calling Love Jihad a conspiracy causes us to turn a blind eye to other threats from the Middle East and Wahhabism.

&gt;RSS is filled with conspiracy theory nuts with a hard on for everything anti-Muslim. I would not get my information from them. In any case, violence, panic and misinformation are not the solutions to the problems. 

So you won't even bother listening to what they have to say? I've noticed this about a lot of RSS haters.

&gt;Hindu existence? A right wing propaganda site? Really? That is proof? That article is from the mind of a clearly disturbed individual.

I already admitted there could be bias, but even propaganda articles use facts. The 90 cases being probed is a fact.

&gt;That is bullshit. But, yes, Saudi Arabia is trying to export their version of Wahhabism around the globe.

Ok at least you admit that. Anyways, the last roughly millennium, most of India has been under foreign rule. Islamic empires and later the British. Don't tell me they treated our women better than now. Foreign invaders will be called foreign invaders.

&gt;You are delusional or naive if you think your RSS relatives do not support the acts of these shitheads. I know my RSS relatives do and that is what the problem with the RSS is.

They're my own relatives. Either way, don't you think there's a possibility of disagreement or difference of opinion in an organisation of 7 million (RSS) or 300+ million (The entire Sangh parivaar)? 

&gt;Yes. Should we now add civilian murders, driven to suicide and vigilantism to the list of ever growing crimes? The BJP was supposed to be a solution, not a problem creator. 

BJP is by no means perfect, but they have actually brought down crime, both civil and political. So I see them as a solution due to a net improvement. 

&gt;Yes. It is a tit for tat game. More CPM men have been killed by RSS men than vice versa. The BJP are trying to twist the narrative. It is not Hindus being killed, it is RSS goons being killed and why? Because there is a history of violence among the two groups in Kannur. 

In the last 16 years, 31 RSS/BJP workers have been killed compared 30 from CPM. However, law and order is entirely a state subject. BJP has never been in power in Kerala, so when CPM cadre men attack Swayamsevaks, it implies they are doing it without proof since they have the power to arrest and try them. 

https://www.google.com/amp/m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-in-bjp-rss-vs-cpm-clashes-roughly-equal-number-of-deaths-on-both-sides/story-bTFP8vUBzFfyHInwiaLJaI_amp.html

&gt;The RSS and their cronies are a cancer and they are spreading it to moderate Hindus and Muslims in India and creating a climate of hate, suspicion, violence and death. 

I'm a moderate Hindu. Will me going to a Shakha make me a radical one all of a sudden? Btw, my family is not that religious and we don't find others eating Beef an issue.

&gt;This will destroy India in a few years. I will then say, 'I told you so'. It is infuriating that more people do not see the direction the country is headed because of these bigoted goons. 

You should actually listen to the former RAW chief if you want to know about national threats. These ""bigoted goons"" are actually getting flack and being called dhimmis by real hardcore Hindus. 

&gt;Oh, and the guy in Rajasthan who hacked and burned a man citing 'love jihad' was the one having the affair. So, yeah. I don't believe any of these love jihad claims.

You had to link every right wing Hindu org with RSS. This is the exact same thing the Lyutens media and its contemporaries have done. We're not illiterates that we don't buy into that narrative.

I remember reading a Quora answer from a Keralite that stated that Keralites told since Kindergarten that RSS is some kind of terrorist organisation. Where do you get your information from? Is there anything you find positive about RSS? 

&gt;Okay. Say that thousands of women are converted to Islam. What is the worst that could happen? There are millions of Muslim women in India already. How many are involved in terrorism? How many are dangerous? What is the issue here? I don't understand it at all.

There are very few to almost no Islamic majority nations that do not have Wahhabism. Unfortunately, Islam in the majority is not safe. We have neighboring Pakistan as a perfect example. Now, why aren't all Indian Muslims becoming terrorists? It's because they're growing up around Hindu, Christians, and Muslims. Don't you think a Muslim who grows up in a diverse community as opposed a Muslim-only Madarasah environment is going to be more open minded and tolerant?"
71,dsv1hf5,"&gt; Sufis spreading Islam is a Western liberal academic narrative that seems to ignore the huge amount of temple destruction and the conversion by the sword events.

Not denying that temples were destroyed. But, thousands were not destroyed too. Christianity destroyed pagan monuments and converted the entire population of continents to Christianity too. Hinduism took over the predominantly Buddhist India post the Mauryas. I am sure Buddhist monuments were destroyed to construct temples then too. What do you want to do? Destroy mosques and place temples there? Things that happened in the past should teach us lessons so that we do not repeat the mistakes from then. I don't see any RSS ideologue preaching that wisdom. It is always destroy this, they plundered that etc. it was all centuries ago. 

&gt; We are all Hindus, some of us have converted when the invaders came, but we are all of the same blood and brothers of the same society.

My people were pagans before the Hindus conquered and converted us. Many were Buddhist before they were converted to Hinduism. We were probably pagans before that. So, aren't we all pagans or Buddhists? I think we aren't going back far enough. 

That statement itself is such a problematic one. People are whatever they want to be. The narrative they want to sell is that Muslims do not belong to India because they are invaders. There were Muslims in India since after it took hold in the Middle East. The west coast constantly traded with them and many merchants settled here and quite a few converted way back. The same with Christianity. To sell this Hindu ideology is to ignore history and also spread falsehoods. People have migrated into India for millennia. North India was probably invaded by people from central Asia thousands of years ago. This would explain genetic similarities with people from the region. We don't really know yet. But, what the RSS is selling is outright lies and their own twisted version of history.

&gt; I sometimes wonder if you guys even know what goes on in a Shakha.

I don't and I frankly don't care. I have read their manifesto and it is scarily similar to the way the Nazi's used to speak. This is the worst thing about them and frankly no amount of good will change the fact that their ideology is grossly divisive and dangerous. 

&gt; Media people have been demonizing us for decades and they speak as if they're complete experts on us.

The RSS was banned by Shri Patel because he thought it was dangerous to the Republic of India. The RSS did not hoist or acknowledge the Indian flag till a few years back. Frankly, I agree with Shri Patel. The RSS and its ideology is extremely dangerous to the Republic of India. 

&gt; So we don't do anything about it?

No. We counter it with moderate views. We counter it with love, equality and respect. 

&gt; In addition, many Indian Muslim girls are also trafficked into the middle east.

Proof and numbers please.

&gt; Calling Love Jihad a conspiracy causes us to turn a blind eye to other threats from the Middle East and Wahhabism.

No. Calling love jihad a conspiracy is the truth. Wahhabism is a different monster. 

&gt; So you won't even bother listening to what they have to say? I've noticed this about a lot of RSS haters.

Well, yes. There is no need to listen to nuts. Are RSS people ready to listen to reason? If yes, I am willing to listen and discuss. 

&gt; I already admitted there could be bias, but even propaganda articles use facts. The 90 cases being probed is a fact.

Just because they use one fact, dos not mean their crap is of value. Maybe 90 probes is a fact, but how many of those turned out to be true? That is what is important, not the other made up shit. I will get my news from neutral sites thank you very much.

&gt; Anyways, the last roughly millennium, most of India has been under foreign rule. 

No. Babar was an invader. Every descendant born on Indian soil since was Indian. 

&gt; Don't tell me they treated our women better than now.

Wtf is this treated women bullshit? What did the Mughals and British do that Hindus have not been doing? Hindus raped Nirbhaya. Hindus kill their daughters for marrying outside their caste. Hindus kill girl children when they are born. So much so that it is illegal to reveal the sex of a baby now. We had child marriage, Sati, widows were shunned, women aren't allowed to visit places of worship during periods, calling them unclean etc. Hindus are no better, so women have it hard no matter who is in power.

&gt; Either way, don't you think there's a possibility of disagreement or difference of opinion in an organisation of 7 million (RSS) or 300+ million (The entire Sangh parivaar)

Yeah. I do think there can be differences, or that there could have been. But every interaction with RSS people makes me realise that there isn't any difference toward their animosity toward Muslims, their medieval outlook toward women, their belief that India is a Hindu rashtra etc. It is dangerous, scary and downright against the democratic values I hold dear.

&gt; BJP is by no means perfect, but they have actually brought down crime, both civil and political. So I see them as a solution due to a net improvement.

I don't know which country you live in, but this is just downright false. Oh, Adityanath pardoned himself and all other politicians, so yeah... you are right, they are reducing crimes by just kicking out all cases against politicians. Sorry I said it was untrue.

&gt; In the last 16 years, 31 RSS/BJP workers have been killed compared 30 from CPM. However, law and order is entirely a state subject.

One extra person. Wow... so much wrong has been done to the RSS.. Oh my god! How can we not see the injustice!! Oh, the horror! 

Seriously.. It is political rivalry. CPM people have died too. Both the parties are to blame. 

&gt; Will me going to a Shakha make me a radical one all of a sudden?

Yes. My uncle was a communist in his youth. Now he is a rabid BJP supporter. My father is moderate, but he believes all the propaganda sold by the RSS. The amount of shitty, hateful, hatemongering, unsubstantiated false crap being sent to me by my relatives forwarded by other RSS/BJP supporters through their social media networks is just insane! I get at least 20 per day. So, yeah. It is not only possible. It is happening a lot.

&gt; Btw, my family is not that religious and we don't find others eating Beef an issue.

That makes it soooo much better for the millions of people who have been denied their livelihood, their diets and the people who have been killed, beaten and bullied. This is another constitutional right that they have infringed upon.

&gt; 
You should actually listen to the former RAW chief if you want to know about national threats. These ""bigoted goons"" are actually getting flack and being called dhimmis by real hardcore Hindus.

I know a former RAW chief. He is the uncle of my close friend. He thinks that the RSS brigade is a national threat. A lot of the intelligence community thinks that too. So, what do we do now?

&gt; You had to link every right wing Hindu org with RSS.

That guy was. He said it himself. He also said on the damn video that he is killing the poor man because of love jihad. Just shows how hateful these guys who sell the idea of love jihad to illiterate idiots are. I hate what my country has become because of them. 

&gt; This is the exact same thing the Lyutens media and its contemporaries have done.

No they don't. This is another blatant lie that the RSS likes to propagate. A lot of the Hindu outfits that do cause violence and bullying are related to the RSS, which is why we hear about Bajrang Dal, Hanuman sena, Sri Ram Sena, VHP etc. Which are the factions that the news say are linked to RSS but aren't? 

&gt; I remember reading a Quora answer from a Keralite that stated that Keralites told since Kindergarten that RSS is some kind of terrorist organisation.

I don't know about this. But, it is true that the RSS is a terrorist organisation now.

&gt; Is there anything you find positive about RSS?

No. If there are positives, they are all negated by the utterly dangerous propaganda.

&gt; There are very few to almost no Islamic majority nations that do not have Wahhabism.

So?

&gt; Unfortunately, Islam in the majority is not safe.

Is that why Malaysia, Indonesia are so safe for the minority Hindus and Buddhists? It is possible for Muslim majority nations to be safe. 

&gt;  Don't you think a Muslim who grows up in a diverse community as opposed a Muslim-only Madarasah environment is going to be more open minded and tolerant?

Well... yeah. That is my point. It is the RSS that want to convert all Muslims to Hinduism. I am perfectly happy with the way Muslims in India go about their business. 

Why haven't you answered any of my questions? 

* Okay. Say that thousands of women are converted to Islam. What is the worst that could happen? There are millions of Muslim women in India already. How many are involved in terrorism? How many are dangerous? What is the issue here? I don't understand it at all.*

Non of these questions have been answered. I would like answers.

 * Muslim Americans are overwhelmingly patriotic and [proud to be American](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/findings-from-pew-research-centers-2017-survey-of-us-muslims/), and see little or no support for extremism among their fellow US Muslims.

 * The majority of Muslim Americans [support gay rights](https://www.hrc.org/blog/majority-of-american-muslims-now-support-lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-people), making them [more accepting than white evangelicals](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/u-s-muslims-more-accepting-homosexuality-white-evangelicals-n788891) ([stats](http://reason.com/blog/2016/06/13/in-america-muslims-are-more-likely-to-su))

Basically, the US does not have a problem with jihadis at the moment. Far from wanting to overthrow US culture, they have assimilated and taken on its beliefs. The biggest terrorist issue the US faces is [white nationalists](http://www.newsweek.com/white-nationalism-much-threat-us-isis-fbis-open-investigations-show-672623) and other angry white guys.

Now, this is _not_ the case in some European countries. France has a major jihadi problem. Its attempts to deradicalize disenchanted Muslims [have failed](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/09/france-jihad-deradicalization-macron/540699/?utm_source=atlgp), and in a rational world we would look at making sure we don't make the same mistakes in the US.

What actually happens, though, is Breitbart and other white nationalist Islamophobic groups point to European events and pretend that the same things are happening in the US, and they try to introduce policies which will actually increase alienation among US Muslims and dramatically increase the chance of jihadism taking root.

Oh, one more thing: Research suggests that while jihadism is associated with Islam, the extremism generally comes first, and Islam is used as an excuse. That's why you get the phenomenon of would-be jihadists [buying Islam for Dummies](https://www.newstatesman.com/religion/2014/08/what-jihadists-who-bought-islam-dummies-amazon-tell-us-about-radicalisation) because they weren't previously religious.

79,dnvlraq,"&gt; Titles are intentionally misinterpreted

The title is literally *White American men are a bigger domestic terrorist threat than Muslim foreigners*. That is demonizing white people, not defending marginalized groups. 

and I did read the article. It consistently points to race in incidents that were clearly mental health issues and it never pro-rates based on population. If you consider that ""white"" Americans were involved in 120 incidents, and there are 120,000,000 white Americans that is a ""terror rate"" of .0001%, where as, there were 60 Islamic incidents and 3,300,000 Muslim Americans which gives you an incident rate of .002%. That is a difference in orders of magnitude. Muslim Americans are statistically more dangerous, and that is just a fact based on the data presented in the article. 

At best it is an over-simplification that seeks to divide based on race. 

&gt; that makes it harder to have the honest conversations our nation needs to find solutions to these problems.

Thank you for coming back in a respectful and intelligent manner.  We might disagree about an emotional topic, but I'm interested in seeking and spreading truth.  If I believe an incorrect idea, then I want to drop that idea and replace it with correct.  Right now I believe I am correct.

Alright, on to your points.

&gt;Kurzman says he operates off a model that presumes the lower end, a bit over 2 million.

Sure, we can use 2 million (~0.6%) Muslims as the estimate.  I was using 1% million for simplicity.  There are more ways than census to estimate a population, for instance


One of the sources wikipedia cites:
http://www.euro-islam.info/country-profiles/united-states#Demographics

&gt;A 2007 survey by Pew Research Center places the figure at 0.6%, but preceding surveys fall somewhere below that estimate: Baylor (2006) at 0.2%, Pew (2000-2007) at 0.5%, 1) General Social Surveys (1998-2006) at 0.5%, 2) Gallup (1999-2001) at 0.3%, American Religious Identification Surveys (2001) at 0.5%, 3) and the National Election Study (2000) at 0.2%. 4) 

So 1% seems like an overestimate; it is closer to 0.5-0.6%.  If Muslim *Americans* are responsible for more than 0.5-1.0% of terrorism (I earlier claimed 10% of incidents) then they are higher than non-Muslims.

You pointed out that my per capita calculation only applies to Muslim *Americans*, which is a good point and I agree.  Since Muslims are rarer in the USA than the rest of the world, hypothetically the same baserate of global terrorism would appear inflated in areas of low Muslim population such as the USA.

In the same source I used earlier: https://www.globalresearch.ca/non-muslims-carried-out-more-than-90-of-all-terrorist-attacks-in-america/5333619

&gt;Of the more than 300 American deaths from political violence and mass shootings since 9/11, only 33 have come at the hands of Muslim-Americans, according to the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security.

I acknowledge that mass shootings without political intent (grouped into the above stat) are not the strict definition of terrorism, but I would argue they are similar in terms of harm.

So 33/300 = 11% of deaths from political violence and mass shootings are from 0.5-0.6% of the population (Muslim *Americans*).

11%/0.6% = Muslims are 18 times the baserate for causing a  death from politcal violence or mass shooting.  Technically it is a bit higher since I'm counting Muslims in that baserate, but we are using estimates anyways.

BBL for global data.

&gt;This was one of the largest hate crimes in our country and not a peep about the impact being had on American freedom. 

I've yet to find a single official statement from either Obama, Pelosi, Schemer, or other senior democrats that DIDN'T mention the impact of the terror attack on American society at-large.

Here's [Obama's statement](http://time.com/4365454/orlando-shooting-president-obama-speech-transcript/) for context.

Who made these statements that didn't mention the impact of the terror attack on American society?

&gt;Basically I believe the democratic party used the backs of gays to get elected the last 8 years,

How do you think they did that? Queer populations are almost entirely clustered in states that are already guaranteed wins for democrats (California, New York, etc.) so I don't know how ""the gay vote"" translated into election wins.

If you're talking about democrats appealing to hetero / cis / etc voters who want to support gay rights as an election strategy, you may have a point. But I don't see anything nefarious about that in itself as long as it's position on issues that affect queer folks come from the concerns / voices of queer folks themselves.

&gt;and they have now tossed us aside for a potentially bigger voter base buy shipping in more Muslims. 

When did democrats ""try and ship in more Muslims"" - fighting Trump's travel ban was preserving the status quo, it wasn't an increase.

I think it's more accurate to say you want lower / no Muslim immigration and the Dems are against that.

To your point have you looked at the demographics of this issue before making this claim that Muslim Americans represent some sort of key strategic voting bloc that will win Dems elections?

Muslim immigrants / refugees to the US overwhelmingly move to states that are already locks for democrats in elections. The Muslim population of the US is only 0.7% last time I checked, and it's not growing fast enough to present a decisive voting block anytime soon.

Given these two key facts, I have no idea why you believe Muslim Americans are some sort of key swing vote for democrats in elections?"
82,dmvld3z,"Tell that to White Christian terrorists who have killed far more people in the United States than Muslims.

83,dlfdx9d,"We're talking about Muslim **Americans** and Christian Americans (the whole point of this thread). Just like I'm not bringing up things Christian terrorist groups like the Lord's Resistance Army do (e.g., child sex slavery, child conscription, murder, mutilation), I don't understand why you're bringing up what ISIS does.

If Muslim Americans are throwing gay people off buildings, then you should definitely alert law enforcement. This is pretty big news."
84,dlnia7i,"Listen, I applaud the sentiment and you sound like a reasonable guy. However, ""he's not an angel, what a surprise"" doesn't mean absolutely anything. Literally every argument about a Trump statement or action could be made to die of sadness with that meaningless phrase: it's the black hole of arguments.

Grab them by the pussy? ""he's not an angel, what a surprise""
I like heroes who were not captured? ""he's not an angel, what a surprise""
Four bankruptcies? ""he's not an angel, what a surprise""
You get the idea...

Now take a list of the 10 things you hated the most about Clinton, and imagine me answering to each: ""she's not an angel, what a surprise"". Feel satisfied? Productive discussion? Great.

As to your ""bottom line"".
Granted. I don't have a source. I did not, however, attribute to him a statement. I speculated about what he thinks. Now, that's always dangerous. So, how did I come to that conclusion, I hear you asking?

Well, he did forward this clearly racist lie that thousands of NJ Muslims were cheering 9/11. He said he watched it happen. He didn't. Apparently that's me ""claiming that it's even worse"". While your phrasing, willingly or not, implies that you don't think pushing that odious pile of bullshit is, in fact, even worse, you missed my point. And that's my fault. I didn't make my point clear, and I'm sorry.

My point was: ""he willingly lied to push a narrative where your average Muslim American (aka, for what I can gather: you) is a terrorist sympathiser; stands to reason that he thinks they should do more, disavow, ecc...""

Is it a stretch? I don't think so. I repeat: he purposely pushes a narrative where your average Muslim American (you) is at least ambivalent about Islamist violence. More proof?

[Trump: “In San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people,” Trump said. “Muslims have to report the problems when they see them,” he later added.](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-debate-san-bernardino-20161009-snap-story.html)

Once again: a lie. Once again: what's the subtext of that lie? Once again: the average Muslim American (you) is ideologically contiguous to Islamist extremism. Maybe not enough to kill, but enough to see bombs and not report them.

So, yeah, I leaped: from ""he thinks many Muslim Americans are terrorist sympathisers"" (you've got two sources on that) to ""he thinks they should disavow terrorism"". Is it a leap? If it is, it's a leap backwards.

Finally, I don't know where you dreamed that I think you should be anti-Trump *because* you're Muslim: I didn't know you were Muslim when I started the argument. I think you can, absolutely without sarcasm, decide that his political abilities in other fields make him a better President, even though he uses your religion as a scare tactic. I mean it: you're Muslim, but you're also other things (anti trade? pro wall? conservative? idk, whatever you want) and being Muslim doesn't have to be the only, or even the main thing that defines your identity. So, by all means, be a happy pro-Trump conservative pro wall anti trade guy who happens to be Muslim.

But none of those things change this one incontrovertible fact: he purposely pushes a narrative where you and people like you are at least ambivalent about Islamist violence. That is a fact. You obviously found a way to make peace with this fact (""he's not an angel, what a surprise""). Good for you. But that remains a fact.

And that's what we were talking about: not how you, a Muslim American, have rationalised that fact. Not even if Trump is right or wrong about that fact. We were just acknowledging that his bigotry is, in fact, a fact."
85,dlq3k6f,"&gt;LOL, dude, you are so upset that the religion with the most terrorists when given the opportunity overwhelmingly identify as left wing. I know its a hard truth to accept, but talking yourself in circles is not going to change this cold hard fact. 

I'm not talking myself in circles just because you don't understand what I'm saying. It also seems like by saying ""the religion with the most terrorists"", you're trying to infer that: 1) Muslim Americans are terrorists in waiting; and/or, 2) Islam is ""left wing"". If that's not what you're saying, my apologies. 

If it is: 1) statistics show Muslim Americans aren't anymore predisposed to terrorism as any other American demographic. 2) You're again conflating liberal/conservative with progressive/conservative. Islam as a religion is a conservative institution, that does not infer an American political alignment. Muslim Americans, however, tend to be the more progressive Muslims...if they were the more conservative Muslims they'd have stayed where Islam and government are one in the same.

&gt;Let me guess, there's always a reason the facts don't apply when they don't fit with the outcome you're trying to produce right? Hmm, kind of like the entire argument i have been making this whole time. Good muslims -&gt; they're on my side. Bad muslims -&gt; they're conservatives.

Not what I've said at any point. You continue to shut out what I said previously, and it's not helping to press the same points over and over.

&gt;I don't [find having Muslims on my side shameful] either. But you're totally wiling to only accept the good muslims on your side. As soon as they become terrorists then they are conservative right?

You're either misunderstanding what I'm saying, or misrepresenting it.

For the last time: **Nobody said that ANY Muslims are ""American right-wing"" conservatives.** *The ideology of conservatism is separate and different from American conservatism,* and on the spectrum of Progressive &lt;---&gt; Conservative, Islam is a conservative ideology.

&gt;How honorable of you to acknowledge that they vote for your side but to pretend the bad ones identify as the other side. I'm sure the father of the night club terrorist was just confused when he went to the hillary rally and sat right behind hillary. He must have been lost. After all, someone who raises their kid in an ideology where they go and murder 50 gay people most assuredly be conservative right? 

I'm not repeating myself anymore. Read about conservative vs progressive, totalitarian vs libertarian, and liberal vs authoritarian. The source of our disagreement is rooted in you confusing/conflating those terms. If you refuse to step outside the American political binary, there's no sense in discussing this further."
86,dlvqgyz,"Jag tror inte att du rättvist kan jämföra en politisk organisation (NMR) med en religion/ideologi. Det hade varit rättvisare att jämföra två idéer.

&gt; ""Det är med andra ord, om jag inte missat något, en näst intill obefintlig politisk organisation.”

Du viftar bort nazismens hot i Sverige för att NMR är en organisation med ”näst intill obefintlig politisk organisation”, samtidigt som du erkänner att de börjar få ett erkännande och att nazismen är på väg tillbaka ""med stora kliv”. Därför anser du att nazismen är ett litet samhällsproblem och du tycker det är *märkligt* att energi &amp; tid läggs på att bekämpa det.

* Så om muslimer hade varit få till sitt antal och en av dessa begått brott, hade du ursäktat dem för att de har en ”näst intill obefintlig politisk organisation”? 

* Du misslyckas att komma ihåg hur nära nazismen är till oss som bor i Sverige rent geografiskt samt historisk placering. Detta är en förklaringsfaktor till ""eftersmaken"" många i Sverige idag har för nazism. 

Du påminner om att det ena är en nazistisk organisation och det andra är en religion efter du skrivit om en islamisk *riksorganisation*? Påminnelsen om religion och nazistisk organisation är ingen du behöver göra, om du inte tänkte hålla dig borta ifrån att felaktigt jämföra dem. 


En ideologi  kan inte förstås som en orsak till handlande, bara för att en handfull personer hävdar att de agerar i ideologins namn. En ideologi är snarare förstådd och fastlagd av dess grundare, urkundstexter och dess lärda tradition. Jag håller dock åsikten att statistik kan ge oss ledtrådar till vad som driver ett visst beteende.

Logiska felslut som appealing to false cause och non sequitur träffas eftersom du inte visar att det ena är en orsak av det andra och baserar din slutsats på väldigt svaga eller irrelevanta anledningar.

Så även om du kan se att muslimer statistiskt sett är mer sannolika att stötta terrorism, så nödvändiggör inte det att islam är den motiverande orsaken. Däremot tror jag att detta säger mer om vår samtid och att denna statistik har något att säga (och det lär vara till vissas förtret).

Inom västvärldens kultur så hyllas självuppoffring (genom bl.a. bombning) som vi ser i filmer som I Am Legend, Armageddon, Starship Troopers, Independence Day osv. Och detta har jag aldrig hört någon ha problem med, så för mig så verkar det snarare vara terrorism som är problemet, och inte självmordsbombning per se.

Jag som muslim håller idén att självmordsbombning (av alla anledningar) är otillåtet enligt Islam.

**[No Link Between Views of Violence and Importance of Religion](http://www.gallup.com/poll/157067/views-violence.aspx)**
&gt; In addition to those who single Islam out, some pundits, most notably the ”New Atheists”, have accused religion in general of encouraging violence. Though the motivations of actual terrorists are beyond the scope of this brief, the evidence regarding public support for targeting civilians challenges this notion.

Av alla nationer som var med i undersökningen så var muslimskmajoriterande länder minst sannolika att stötta s.k. ”acts of terrorism”. Utöver detta så visade resultatet på att de muslimer som *gör* det [stöttar terror] också är mer sannolika att vara isolerade ifrån sina respektive samhällen och har en syn på religion som mindre central i deras liv.

87,dlw8txb,"Speaking as an American here, I'm surprised more comments haven't focused on the reaction to terrorism as something worthy of concern.

In 2001, Richard Reid attempted to detonate a shoe bomb on an American Airlines flight. He was unsuccessful. No one died. And yet for the last 16 years, almost every American passing through the TSA has had to remove their shoes. That was the result of an *unsuccessful* terrorist attack.

Successful attacks have had far more devastating results than that, in addition to the lives lost. Terrorist attacks perpetrated by groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS are often followed by an increase in hate crimes towards innocent Muslim Americans. Are Muslim Americans unjustified in fearing terrorist attacks, based on the expected fallout? And what about the American Sikhs, South Asians, or unreligious Middle Easterners who get lumped in with Muslims because of their appearances and are also subject to the escalated discrimination and violence that occurs after these incidents?

9/11 brought us the Patriot Act, which enabled government agencies like the NSA to collect data on citizens* which experts argue [doesn't work](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/nsas-call-record-program-911-hijacker-and-failure-bulk-collection) and actually leaves us [less secure](http://time.com/2966463/nsa-spying-surveillance-cybersecurity-privacy-advocates-schneier/). Isn't the erosion of our security and safety something to legitimately fear?

I would argue that the threats to our way of life and continued safety that result from un/intended consequences of terrorism are more worthy of concern than the fear of death from being directly involved in an attack.

*US collection of bulk data from its own citizens has actually been going on since before 9/11, but the terrorist attack was a huge catalyst in getting it accepted in the open and by citizens."
88,djqnayo,"Well what you're doing is discounting someone without even making any attempt to get to know them.  And that's exactly what the doctor in the article is frustrated about.  I bet if you talked to him in real life, I mean actually talked to him, you'd learn that he's just a normal person like the rest of us.

Yeah you can poke holes in Islam all you want.  It's easy.  You can say Muhammad was a pedophile or a warmonger or whatever.  And maybe you don't like that about his religion.  But that's for him to reconcile with.

Let me paint a small picture of one of my good friends who is Muslim.   His name is Nasir.  He's 28.  He works at a bank.  He listens to rock and metal, likes movies, and he'll come over and play videogames.   He doesn't drink, but he'll come out to the bar and get a diet coke.  We'll play darts and talk about girls.  He likes to watch hockey.   He has a lot of friends and is a likeable guy.

You might say he is not the average Muslim in the United States but I can assure you he is.   You might say he is not one of those devout Muslims but I can assure you he fasts the entire month of Ramadan with no water.  

If you immediately assumed there is something wrong with him for being Muslim or that he is morally bankrupt for being so you'd never get to know him.   You'd discount him right away and continue to make the association that you hear on the 24 hour news networks -- that Muslim equals terrorist, that they want to impose sharia law, that they hate America.  That's why the doctor in the article is so frustrated.  That's why Muslim Americans are frustrated by Trump's rhetoric.   We're all just people, and I'm not trying to be hard on you man.   I'm just telling you that you have actually get to know people instead of going along with what you hear, or you'll continue to perpetuate stereotypes that divide us."
89,djv168h,"&gt; I am discussing Islam as a set of ideas, not Muslims as a group of people.

They're on and the same.  Islam is dictated by Muslims.  They refer to the Quran, but the Quran is limited.  It's a single book.  Many of the Islamic traditions were set up by early Muslim scholars, making educated guesses that worked in the middle ages, but don't with modern tech and social issues.  The Quran is finite.  

&gt;My assertion was that the woman who founded a liberal mosque should be more afraid of the death threats she receives than you should over claiming one gaming system is better than another.

No, she should only be afraid because she's been giving international attention.  Again, she didn't invent the liberal mosque.  There are plenty all over the world.  Some might be more secretive about their accepting of gays, sure.  but there are still plenty in the West, for example.

Lastly, no one should be afraid of death threats.  Terrorists arent' as successful as the media makes them seem.  For every successful terror attack, there are dozens of murders and fatal car accidents.  This woman should be more scared crossing the street.

No, she shouldn't be scared.  That's what puts the ""terror"" in ""terrorist"".

&gt;More generally, I offer criticism of the ideology of Islam as it stands in opposition to the practice of western liberalism and social egalitarianism.

The problem with generalities is that you can say anything and it's technically correct.  I can say the exact opposite, and it'll still be true.  ""The benefit of Islam is that, generally, it fits very well into the practice of western liberalism and social egalitarianism."" I would then use the fact that in the west, every single Western-Muslim politician I've ever found has been in the left leaning political party.

&gt;You can play the whataboutism card all you want

you keep referring to this. It doesn't take away from my point.  If Islam was a violent religion, it would be more violent than, say, the US.  but it isn't, statistically speaking.  So the entire foundation of this claim is wrong.

&gt; as well as the toxic ideology of jihad, martyrdom and paradise that motivates the intentional targeting and killing of non-combatants in an effort to spread political Islam.

So let me ask you this.  a Jew fighting on the front lines of WWII against Hitler dies.  According to Islam, he dies a martyr, even though he isn't a Muslim (you'll get some Muslim scholars who disagree with me, and vice versa, but scripturally, my point is sound).  Do you disagree with this sentiment, assuming God exists?  That the Jew who died should go to heaven?

Now, we look at the middle east today, where the people are angry after years of oppression and war.  They believe they are being targeted for being Muslim.  If they are or not, it doesn't matter, because they BELIEVE they are.  It makes sense, if you think about it, the west only seems to bomb Muslim countries.  But that's a whole different argument.  

So if these Muslims believe they are fighting and dying for freedom, does that make them wrong?  This has nothing to do with Islam, because even the Nazi soldiers believed they were fighting for what's right.  They may have been manipulated, coerced, bribed, whatever.  but did you blame Nazism on Christianity?  If so, you'd be very incorrect, but you'd be more correct to blame anti-jewish sentiment on the European Churches.  

So it's much more complex than religion.  If it was Islam, then Islamic history wouldn't have been as liberal as it was, (and it was the most progressive region on earth during it's height, and even relatively speaking, it was far more progressive than it currently is today).  Political rulers DO NOT dictate Islam.  They just pretend to, and they manipulate people into believing them.  THAT is the problem.  Politicians and rulers in the Muslim world currently in power are involved in very horrible issues of invasions and riots since the 1800s.  

&gt;I invite you to check this PEW poll out on global attitudes in the Muslim world:

Don't link that meme article.  It's a poll about ~1.5 billion people all over the world.  It's a single piece in a massive, 10,000 piece puzzle.  This isn't an argument about What rural egyptians think, or Pakis who grew up being bombed their whole lives think.  Islam is fluid.  It melds to the ideas of the people.  Again, it's why these German PMs voted FOR gay marriage, and why a Saudi politician would vote against it.  Because in SAUDI culture, homosexuality is viewed as evil, but in Germany culture, it's a non-issue (for the most part).  

So Islam is irrelevant in a sense.  It's not as absolute as you assume it is.

&gt;The reason Islam should be examined and critiqued is to lessen the burden on all those hundreds of millions of Muslims (the women, the gays, the non-believers and apostates, etc) who live in socially repressive societies and cannot live their lives fully.

You can not help people thousands of miles from you.  Only they can help themselves. You have no right to interfere or critique what they think.  You do have a right to critique the philosophies and ideals of your neighbors and countrymen, 100%.  You have a right to analyze islam, and point out flaws you find.  But you also need to take that right seriously.  Muslims have plenty of issues, even in the west, but it's rare that a non-Muslim understands those issues.  You are reacting to the superficial and to what's reported on the news.

In my experience (I grew up in one of the largest Muslim American communities in the US, that has been here since the 50s), these issues usually involve relationships.  rushing to get married so they can have sex and then getting divorced because they realize they hate each other, families getting mad when their children date/marry outside of their ethnicity even if they're Muslim, women in their 30s being judged for not being married.  These issues cause Muslims problems, but never have I seen ""We have to outlaw gay marraige!""  The worst I hear is that it's disgusting, that they'll burn in hell forever and all eternity, ect.  But the law is no one's concern, because it's legal to have gay sex in the US (even before gay marriage was legalize).  The issues Muslims have about homosexuality in the US are the exact same issues religious non-Muslims in the US have.  Actually, statistically, US Muslims are less likely to be aggressive about such stances, even when compared to Jews.

90,diahrsf,"AutoMod hid my last comment.

Bunch of muslims living in western countries do something good and you guys start deepthroating them ignoring what happens on a daily basis.

Just like those muslims who are part of terrorist organizations and spread terror are a ""minor"" part of the billions of muslims these Muslim-Americans are also a minor part of that billion.

Not ignoring Islamic Terrorism makes me a bigot then I am a proud bigot. If only there were a word to describe you that would start with ""f"" and rhyme with ""spigot""

Come live in a country where Muslims don't make the small numbers they do in USA and then maybe you'll learn something."
91,dj14oq7,"Ok I understand your positions. I will address them one by one

1) First off, dont throw stones if you live in glass house. Your username is literally 'katua slayer' and you throw the allegation that Islam is not religion of peace.  Its like a naked man asking you to wear clothes.
Secondly, I can see where you are coming from with all these terrorist attacks being done in the name of Islam in India and Europe &amp; also with the rise of Isis and Al Qaeda. These peoples are not on the right path of Islam at all. For example suicide is impermissible in Islam yet these so called 'Muslims' will fly plane  into buildings and blow themselves up. Yes Jihad is part of Islam but we are not allowed to be the aggressor. We are allowed to defend ourselves if needs be but we are not allowed to overstep the limits. For example, these terrorist groups quote these [verses] (http://imgur.com/aBGGM9u) out of context to justify their actions, this just shows how ignorant they are.

2) You say that we are pampered by India yet we the country have elected Prime Minister Modi who has not apologised for the mob killing of innocent muslims in 2002 Gujarat riots. We have also seen rise in gau rakshaks Hindu nationalists killing muslims and him giving subtle support for it. No wonder so many Muslims become radicalised when they see injustice and lash out although two wrongs dont make right.

3) I understand where you are  coming from. Many muslims  don't like to mix with Hindus.The Hindus and muslims should come together and sort out this issue together, Islam does not prevent us from being kind to non-believers ['Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.'](https://quran.com/60/8)

On the issue of 'Love jihad', you have to understand that yes in our religion Muslim girls are not allowed to marry Hindu man because the child will be raised up in Hindu religion as the kid takes this fathers religion. As for Hindu wife eating beef and read kalma(which mean shahada) that is up to her and thats her choice if she wants.

4) I agree with you on that statement. We should always try to seek  peace and understanding will all religions in secular India."
92,dih9xqh,"You are more likely to die from lightning than a terrorist attack. Besides, Muslim Americans are more financially successful, are far more entrepreneurial and commit less crime than the average American. This is a testament to the US immigration system, they do a pretty good job."
93,dh51pt2,"This is probably futile since you've already made up your mind on us libruls and, perhaps more importantly, you've already made up your mind on the Islamic faith but humor me for a minute. I think that you are personally invested in the anti-terror side of the argument against Islam and, without a doubt, the terrorist problem is definitely a reality. However, your perception of the Islamic faith is based on a skewed reality created by the terrorists in order to try to radicalize more believers into joining the ISIS movement. That radicalization has actually radicalized you in the opposite direction, which also helps the ISIS movement. I think if you spent some time connecting with some local Muslims on the bare-minimum, you would understand that most Muslims who are in this country are actually very different from the likes of ISIS and most aren't even very orthodox in their beliefs. 

Anyway, my point is, I spent some time in High School experiencing what other religions and communities were like around my city. Whenever there is a terrorist attack, it does help to stay grounded by remembering that most Muslim Americans are not actually that different from most Catholic Americans or Mormon Americans... Well, other than praying to a giant black cube. And if you think that's weird, Mormons wear woolly underwear! 

Listen, I actually don't really like the Islamic faith myself, but I have to tolerate it in the same way I have to tolerate Judaism or Christianity. I also have to respect the rights of the people to choose to worship whatever stupid thing they want to worship. Not only that, but if you spend time talking with some individuals from a religion you don't like or don't understand, you will quickly realize that most of them are just living whatever life they want to live and don't really want to impose that upon others. So who am I to impose my beliefs onto them?"
94,dh76886,"We no longer need internment camps in a country so heavily monitored by the government. The only people successfully carrying out terrorist attacks here after 9/11 are spur-of-the-moment crazies, with the exception of the Boston Bomber.

Internment camps were the product of a racist government that was unable to tell which Japanese were saboteurs and the unwillingness to take the time to find out. Computers have made that way easier. The trade off is that most muslim Americans are likely far more heavily monitored than they realize."
95,di18bg7,"&gt;The difference is that about 40% of uk muslims (more globally) are OK with violence to support Islam. Christianity has largely been defanged. Islam never can be.

There's a double standard where American Christians, and particularly evangelicals, support violence to defend their faith and imposing religious law, but it's seen as a problem with certain people or sects, rather than Christianity itself. About the same percentage support violence against abortion providers as Muslims support Al-Qaeda, and in both cases terrorist attacks occur as a result. 

Christianity is in power in some of these societies, so the violence happens through rule of law targeting women, immigrants, and religious minorities, as well as wars that kill more innocents than terrorism does. When the extremists are out of power, like some Muslim ones, they use tools of disruption outside the state norms, which seem more shocking and inappropriate. It doesn't mean thought that only one religion is fueling violence.

Your post history establishes a pretty gross theme of denigrating Muslim people. Just say Islam next time instead of dog-whistling.

[Pew Research](https://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/terrorism-and-concerns-about-extremism/) also suggests that Muslim Americans are just as likely as other Americans to fear global Islamic terrorism and extremism. 

If your vague implication here is that Islamic culture is intrinsically intolerant, how would you rectify the massive differences between western Muslims and other demographics in Muslim-majority countries? Furthermore, what is your knowledge of Iraqi Muslim culture compared to Senegalese? To Lebanon? Israel? German?

How might the destabilization of certain regions play into your fascinating analysis of Islam also?

Most do not deny that Islam — as with any religion — has egregious flaws. But this perspective that Islam is inherently corrupted and the Muslims within it wish to ""wipe everyone else from the face of the planet"" is incredibly xenophobic and promotes an unfair hatred against Muslims that even protest those same egregious flaws alongside everyone else."

It matters because there is a lot of people who automatically associate Muslim with terrorism. The idea of a Female Muslim being elected to represent her constituents sends a clear message that not all Muslims want to see America fail. In spite of far right propaganda it shows that this nation has made progress and Muslim Americans are actively taking part in performing their Civic duties."

As a teenager, I was taken to various houses and flats above takeaways in the north of England, to be beaten, tortured and raped over 100 times. I was called a “white slag” and “white c***” as they beat me.

They made it clear that because I was a non-Muslim, and not a virgin, and because I didn’t dress “modestly”, that they believed I deserved to be “punished”. They said I had to “obey” or be beaten.

&gt;In November 2017, the Swedish government held a meeting where they stated that: “Sexual violence is being used as a tactic of terrorism”, and as such, it was recognised as a threat to Sweden’s national security.


&gt;Religious ideas about purity, virginity, modesty and obedience are taken to the extreme until horrific abuse becomes the norm. It was taught to me as a concept of “othering”.

“Muslim girls are good and pure because they dress modestly, covering down to their ankles and wrists, and covering their crotch area. They stay virgins until marriage. They are our girls.

""White girls and non-Muslim girls are bad because you dress like slags. You show the curves of your bodies (showing the gap between your thighs means you’re asking for it) and therefore you’re immoral. White girls sleep with hundreds of men. You are the other girls. You are worthless and you deserve to be gang-raped.”
&gt;This hateful religious hypocrisy strikes people to their very core. But it’s far from unique. My main perpetrator quoted scriptures from the Quran to me as he beat me."

101,ekngskz,"There's no way to charitably reword it. It's miles away from being accurate, and it's especially bad in the context of a society in which Muslims are far more likely to be the victims of hate crime than the perpetrators. To still be playing this game is gross.

It's one thing to overreact after 9/11. That was a shocking level of terrorism. But it's more than obvious that our reaction was egregious and completely ineffective. The whole mindset of ""war"" between the two cultures is bullshit. Muslim Americans are more liberal politically than White Evangelicals."
102,eia2vzb,"It's necessarily skewed by an amount we don't know. any unsolved murder is counted in the non standard category.

another factor that skews it is the fact that illegals don't report crimes, and don't answer the door when social workers come to help them. ask me how I know.

The percentage of any population committing crimes is very very small, even among young black men, who commit violent crime at a rate maybe a dozen times higher. it's like terrorism, too. Muslim Americans are 15-30x more likely to commit terrorism than any other group, but that still is just a handful of people. 

I am concerned about the 1% of the people who come to commit crimes. and the roughly 7% who are here who have criminal records. Why subject our poorest populations to more crime? 

again, I'm talking about hundreds of rapes a day crossing the border. there is organized crime bringing people across the border and hurting them. how is it racist to be concerned about their wellbeing?  it seems more racist to discount it because their rapist might be brown.

I agree we should make legal immigration easier, but we need to clear out the backlog in the immigration system. to do that, we need to stop the flood of illegals.

Still, 35% of our immigrants are Mexican, and it doesn't make sense to favor them in our legal system just because they can walk here. especially when Mexico is comparatively a very safe and good place to live if you are outside cartel territory.

I am also in favor of punishing companies that hire illegals, because they create an environment where these people can be abused.

I don't begrudge these people their decision to break the law, as I don't really put government above people, but our government should be representing us, their people. and while they're at it, they could cut down on sex traffic, drug traffic, and violence. this is a problem, and not fixing it is a moral failing. "
103,eiklisy,"&gt;The FBI, on the other hand, has already concluded that white supremacists, including neo-Nazi supporters and members of the Ku Klux Klan, are in fact responsible for the lion’s share of violent attacks among domestic extremist groups. White supremacists “were responsible for **49 homicides** in 26 attacks from **2000 to 2016** … more than any other domestic extremist movement,” reads the joint intelligence bulletin.

For 200 million white Americans, that's a negligible amount. Proportionally, the 1% of Muslim Americans are (as far as I recollect) 30x more likely to commit terrorism than the 60% non-Hispanic white counterpart. 

Anyway, you could make such a list any number of countries on this planet. You only care for the West since they're (for the time being) the dominant ones that people want to move to. If it's such a concern for you, don't go there ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Though given that the US will be minority white within a generation, I don't think it'll be a massive concern on your part.

Frankly, discrimination and violent expressions of hate against entire classes of people still exist in the USA. *Hate crimes are akin to terrorism, in that they are designed to threaten entire communities and groups. Hate crimes also statistically involve more violence. And many say our laws should reflect that violence rooted in bigotry has no place in our society, and will be punished.*

When gay people are protected from job and housing discrimination, when Muslims are not barred from visiting this country because of their religion and Muslim Americans are allowed to be be religious without apology, and when new immigrants are not identified as murderers, thieves and drug pushers by members of the American government then call me.

&gt;25% of Egyptians support suicide bombings.

[This](https://news.gallup.com/poll/157067/views-violence.aspx) has Egyptians as having the lowest rate of support for believing that military attacks on civilians are sometimes justified and that individual attacks on civilians are sometimes justified, at 3% and 2% respectively (to put this into perspective, America clocks in at a whopping 49% and 22%), so I'm not sure what this is trying to establish. 

&gt;36% of Muslims believe 9/11 was partially or wholly justified. 

There has never been a global poll for the entire population of Muslims, so this statistic is definitely false. The most comprehensive poll on Muslims to my knowledge is the 2013 Pew poll, which only covered 39 Muslim countries

&gt;78% of Egyptians support attacks on US soldiers in the Middle East.

I think it is very telling that you think that proving this statistic to be true would be a good point in your favour. Supporting attacks on foreign soldiers is so abnormal.

&gt; Great anecdote bro! Did your relatives just have their heads too far up their asses to vote in 2012?

No. They voted in 2012 too, but Romney wasn't the champion of white grievance like Trump. It infects all aspects of politics: how to deal with terrorism, immigrants, Islam in general, black people, Hispanic judges, on and on it goes. 

&gt;Trump won those who felt terrorism was the biggest issue by 16 points.

Right, and they were all outraged by the Iran deal. Now guess how many could find Iran on a map.

At least he doesn't appear blind to this issue that has killed hundreds of thousands of people worldwide in the last few years. It's a lie, and people know it's a lie, and they're insulted at being lied at so blatantly.

Except they're too stupid to understand that it's not a ""lie"" to be concerned with multiple opposing issues. Diplomacy with Muslim countries is the only way to reduce the impact of radical Islam. Muslim Americans are victims of hate crimes far more often than they promote violence.

113,dxit5xx,"&gt; wrong. because if it included internet attacks it would be in the thousands.

Nice source you got there. And I highly doubt it. They will only include prosecutions of hate speech which led to conviction, and given the inconsistencies of Germany's hate speech law, which directly conflicts with their constitution, the number you cited is likely accurate.

&gt;and even if it was using those numbers, there are more jews than muslims in germany. so let capita, id still be correct.

False. [There are approximately 1.5M Muslims in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Germany). [There are only 119k Jews in germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Germany#Jews_in_the_reunited_Germany_(post-1990)). So per capita, the rate of hate crimes against jews is approximately 15x higher than for muslims.

&gt;except that 95% of bigoted attacks aren't committed by muslims.

Depends on the target demographic, however, due to Germany's censorship of data regarding muslim crime, the statistics are unclear. I challenge you to first, define ""bigoted attack"" and then find a statistic that supports your argument. Good luck.

&gt;when muslims do something like start the world wars, commit genocide close to anything nationalists have done, or bomb an entire region for several decades, then maybe this claim would have some merit. but history and current events have shown us otherwise.

You don't know shit. Obviously. Islam is a religion of hate established by a warlord who himself committed genocide against his own tribe. 

&gt;also, statistically:

&gt;https://niskanencenter.org/blog/muslim-americans-are-more-likely-to-reject-violence-intolerance-than-many-americans/

There are 1.6B muslims worldwide. The 3 million here don't represent them all, at least according to the most comprehensive survey of Islamic followers worldwide, ever conducted. Pew.

http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/

Theres a lot of backward shit in there. Like 85% of muslims believing women must be subservient to men or a vast majority supporting death for leaving Islam. Islam is a religion of hate. That's all there is to it.

&gt;muslims in the US are more liberal, less anti gay, and less violent than any other religious group. they're the most educated except for jews.

We don't put up with barbarism like europe does. Those views are born of necessity, not choice.

&gt;all muslim MPs in germany voted in favor of gay marriage. the muslim mayor of london is very much to the left.

The muslim mayor of london also believes terrorism is just ""part and parcel"" of living in a major city. Seems like something a muslim would say. Muslims also practice deception, and have for 1400 years, in order to infiltrate new societies and eventually establish islamic governments.

On to the second article. I actually read it, which makes me pretty fucking sure you didn’t.

Why do you think that is?

I was wrong actually. The number is .02%. Out of the world's 1.6 Billion Muslims, the RAND Corporation estimates that there about 300,000 that are, or are highly likely to become, militant extremists. 300,000 out of 1.6 Billion is .02%

Well, exactly. There are thousands of Christian murderers in America, hundreds of Jewish rapists, etc. Every religious group, especially those with hundreds of millions of adherents, is diverse and contains good people and bad people. The problem is when you make it about their religion, and use their religion as determinative of their proclivity toward terrorism. That's bigotry.
"
117,dl8o3dv,"Do you have a source for this claim?

Actually, rather than try to argue that, let's look at [Pew Research and their findings on Muslims in the US](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/26/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/).

There's a lot in here, but let's focus on the section ""What do American Muslims believe?"".

This immediately leapt out at me:

*Roughly seven-in-ten U.S. Muslims (69%) say religion is very important in their lives. Virtually all (96%) say they believe in God, nearly two-thirds (65%) report praying at least daily and nearly half (47%) say they attend religious services at least weekly. By all of these traditional measures, Muslims in the U.S. are roughly as religious as U.S. Christians*

Looking good for your claim. Let's move on.

&gt;As of 2011, U.S. Muslims were somewhat split between those who said homosexuality should be accepted by society (39%) and those who said it should be discouraged (45%), although the group had grown considerably more accepting of homosexuality since a similar survey was conducted in 2007.

Well, they're better than they used to be, but ow. That's pretty rough. Nearly half believe homosexuality should be discouraged. It should be noted that the previous survey, performed only four years ago, far more said homosexuality should be discouraged (61%) than accepted (27%). So that's a big shift in a short time.

Looking good! Let's see if we can find some more info about that. [Well, here's some...](http://www.people-press.org/2011/08/30/section-5-political-opinions-and-social-values/)

Hmm. Turns out they're significantly below the broader public. ""The broader public has become more accepting of homosexuality as well. Currently, 58% say homosexuality should be accepted, while 33% say it should be discouraged. In 2006, about half (51%) said homosexuality should be accepted, while 38% said it should be discouraged.""

That's a big gulf. But is it better than Christians?

*Acceptance of homosexuality has risen significantly among those with high levels of religious commitment (from 16% in 2007 to 30% today) as well as those with medium levels of religious commitment (from 21% in 2007 to 37% today). However, those who express a low level of religious commitment continue to be more accepting (57%) than those with a high religious commitment (30%). Four years ago, 47% of those with low religious commitment said homosexuality should be accepted, compared with 16% among those who express a high commitment.*

So... actually, in fact, this does seem to be the case!

Genuinely pretty surprised about this, but let's see what else is in there.

*Nearly seven-in-ten U.S. Muslims (68%) say gender makes no difference in the quality of political leaders. Still, about a quarter (27%) say men make better political leaders. Very few (4%) say women make better leaders. There are only slight differences in views on this between men and women and among various age groups.*

*Among the U.S. public, 72% say gender does not determine who will be the better political leader. About one-in-ten each say men (12%) or women (13%) make better leaders.*

That's kind of rough. Pretty big gulf there. Not insurmountable, but still strong.

But what terrorism? [Let's take a look](http://www.people-press.org/2011/08/30/muslim-americans-no-signs-of-growth-in-alienation-or-support-for-extremism/).

The overwhelming majority say suicide bombings are never justified. 1% often, 7% sometimes, 5% rarely, ~80% never.

Compared to fucking 31% for ""Often"", 37% for sometime in Palestine. Fuck.

There's a few things that are troubling there. 21% of US Muslims consider there to be a ""great deal"" of support for extremist Muslims in the US. That's a worry. And 5% have a ""favourable"" view of al Qaeda, with only 11% being ""somewhat unfavourable"". 1-in-20 being ""favourable"" sounds bad, but that's almost within margin of error for these kinds of things. It's more troubling to me that these numbers, while very low, are actually above the levels for foreign born Muslims. Hmm.

So... good job here too.

There's some more things there that give me worries, like that 20% say that Muslims in this country want to be distinct from the larger American society (that's quite high, basically 1-in-5). Fortunately, 56% say they do want to assimilate. Which is good.

Regarding your point, this leaped out at me:

*When asked to choose, nearly half of Muslims in the U.S. (49%) say they think of themselves first as a Muslim, while 26% see themselves first as an American; 18% volunteer that they are both. In a 2011 survey by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, 46% of Christians in the U.S. say they identify as Christian first while the same number identify as American first. White evangelicals are much more likely to identify first as Christian (70%).*

That's surprising, but probably not *too* surprising.

So basically: I feel like the only conclusion I can make is, you were right.

There is some troubling things not covered by this report however, and I feel these issues are genuine.

A 63% majority of Muslim Americans are first-generation immigrants to the U.S., with 45% having arrived in the U.S. since 1990. However, if you look at Europe, they've had Islamic immigration for decades before that; going all the way back to World War 2.

Immigrants are not usually the problem. They know their homes are shitty and came to their new homes for a reason. Very few actual migrants have gone on to commit acts of terror in Europe.

Children of immigrants, however, do.

So you asked: ""So why are American Muslims more Liberal than American Evangelical Christians?""

The answer is: they are because they are the first generation.

Maybe it's all for naught. Maybe the events of Europe aren't about to play out in the USA. I suspect an improved vetting process and not simply opening their doors to all comers probably helps, but certainly the best available information regarding American Muslims indicates that the Muslims living in the US are no worse than Evangelicals, more or less, and are roughly the same -- even possibly more liberal.

That said, fuck evangelicals.

Sometimes research can surprise you. Thanks for asking this question, it changed my view on this matter. I don't know what makes American Muslims so different from the rest of the world, since Pew Research has a *lot* of bad things to say about the global Islamic community, but there you go."
118,dj7edv3,"I'm not claiming to know precisely what you experienced. I hope I didn't come off as presumptive.  You certainly have a level of experience and knowledge due to your travels. I was merely responding to the content of your comment, how you phrased your comment and the context of it. The context is a march on terrorism and your reply in that context seems to imply that terrorism is one of those things that we just happen to disagree with the Islamic world on, and that disagreement is related to Islam itself. This is just wrong. If you want I can elaborate, but I think you yourself would admit this.  Terrorism is very different from illiberal values, such as anti-homosexual marriage, misogyny, tolerance. That has to be recognized. I think there's some truth in the content of your post, but it has no place in the OP's thread. 

""Concerns like homophobia, misogyny, and inter-religious intolerance exist just about everywhere. However, I've found it worrying that what appears to be a brunt of Muslim-majority countries all cite Islam as being the prime and divine justification for ideas which have lost traction in the Western world over the course of the past several decades."" I think you'd find similar illiberal values, in varying degrees, in certain Christian-majority African countries, Hindu-majority India, Christian influenced parts of Eastern Europe, parts of South America, and evangelical/conservative parts of America. I don't think Islam has any monopoly on this.  Actually, if anyone is playing a leading role in deliberately spreading these values, its Russia.  I'm not sure if you're aware of the influential Aleksandr Dugin, called 'Putin's favorite philosopher', who is promoting this movement to have Russia lead a movement to spread 'conservative/traditional' values. Part of this strategy is to promote rightist parties in democratic elections (see Trump, le Pen). Also part of this strategy is to befriend the Muslim world for its supposed shared values. More importantly, he explicitly ties his values to Christianity.

I do think Islam plays a role in these attitudes, but it is not as simple as you describe it.  This is because Islam can be taken in many directions; it isn't locked in by orthodox hierarchy like the Catholic Church for example.  

Polls are interesting. Aside from methodology, interpreting them is problematic.  For example, in this poll, Muslim Americans are less likely to believe it is okay to target civilians in military operations. Christians on the contrary mostly believe it to be justifiable. This doesn't fit into the whole the 'Muslim world is more likely to sympathize with killing civilians' trope. They're sympathetic to suicide bombing but not sympathetic to collateral damage? That makes no sense. Polls reveal strange inconsistencies sometimes. http://www.gallup.com/poll/148763/muslim-americans-no-justification-violence.aspx

Let's say the Pew polls are correct representations of the opinions of the respondents.  Even then, your contention that Islam as a religion is the culprit is unjustifiable.  This is because for Islam to be the primary culprit, it would have to lead to the same result regardless of what country it was in.  But this is not the case. As you know the poll shows results that vary by country (not all Muslim countries feel the same way on these issues).  This only proves my earlier point about the direction that Islam can be taken in; it's flexible believe it or not, to a degree.

""I will reiterate that I do not hate Islam, but I do think the religion, in its current incarnation, is more likely to foment intolerance than most any other."" Intolerance of what? Liberal values? Don't we, in America, foment intolerance of things we disagree with? For example, we are intolerant of anti-capitalist movements/governments. I think that charge of intolerance should be qualified if its going to go beyond a mere buzzword.  
"
119,dgv20c5,"&gt; or maybe muslims are bad people because areas with more muslims have more acts of terrorism and horrific and brutal attacks on women and LGBT.

nah, i'm gonna stick with the literally decades of psychopathic white people bombing them, ending all systems of policing and education, causing their societies to regress. because muslims born in the west are far more tolerant of LBGT people than christians, in the us for example. they're also less violent. 

https://niskanencenter.org/blog/muslim-americans-are-more-likely-to-reject-violence-intolerance-than-many-americans/

so since environment is far more significant than religion, we can blame the people creating be environment: americans and british and french. 

&gt;it barely happens at all in the US, it happens monthly in some areas in the EU, WEEKLY in severe cases

no it doesn't. comments on 4chan and reddit saying it happens all the time doesn't mean it actually happens. crime has gone up due to the influx of refugees, but that's an issue with a suddenly influx of refugees. you can have that amount of ANY refugees of any religion and have those same problems. 

not only that, those problems faded quicker than any refugee crisis in history. 

&gt;maybe EVEN IF the comments actually were bigoted and not merely stating the facts, it still would be morally wrong to say this person deserves to be charged with a criminal act for their statement.

the law is the law. remember last year when a magazine got fined for insulting jews? but everyone praised Hebdo for insulting muslims. i bet you didn't even care that the guy who insulted jews was fined. it's only wrong because it was muslims being talked about like a problem? would a guy who said ""91% of these students are atheists, and that's a problem!"" be defended?"
120,dha4cws,"1. You're comparing statistics not between Muslims and Christians, but Muslims in Middle Eastern countries and Christians in Western countries. You'd find more closely related data if you compared Muslims in Nigeria and Christians in Nigeria.

2. If you actually looked at data of Western Muslims, you'll see that their statistics are basically [the equivalent of your average Republican on social issues](http://www.ispu.org/public-policy/american-muslim-poll/). Some polls even show that Muslim Americans are [more likely to oppose terrorism and violence against civilians than other religious faiths and demographics.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/08/a-fascinating-look-at-the-political-views-of-muslim-americans/242975/)

You see a radical difference when you compare radically different countries and regions. It's absurd compare Muslims located in Yemen with the beliefs of Christians located in say, Germany. Regardless of religion, the very culture and state of these countries will result in radically different social beliefs. If you compare data within the actual country, you'll see that Muslims hardly differ than Christians (at least here in America, seeing as data on that country are the only statistics I could find that do cross examination of political beliefs across religious lines)."
121,fk2perl,"&gt; We also aren't getting many Muslim immigrants, if any at all. So that isn't really relevant to you, is it?

Right back at you!

*It’s definitely a threat if we don’t actively stamp out the influence of Islam. You literally cannot let them gain a voting majority because they will do exactly what you’re saying isn’t a threat.*

Like, you're worried that Muslim Americans are gonna soon take over a voting majority in the US? We need to follow Trump's lead and ""stamp them out""? 

&gt;The tweet was even talking about London. Why would you even talk if you have nothing relevant to add to the discussion?



Yeah, where would I have ever gotten the impression to talk about London falling to hordes of Muslims immigrants. How could that possibly be related to this post... 🤔"
122,f36otel,"&gt;That's not a very good threat considering muhammad has been in the top 10 birth names in the UK for the past couple years.

Largely because first-born Muslim boys are routinely called Muhammed (or variations on that spelling) whereas non-Muslims pick from a much wider pool of names for their first-born."
123,f22uhve,"&gt;The swastika was a religious symbol, one which you can still wear quite comfortably today. 

Oh *really?*

Quite *comfortably* did you say?

This statement is so detached from reality that it barely deserves a response. But please, by all means--go right ahead. Wear a T-shirt with a big swastika on it and go out in public and just explain to anyone who is offended that it's just a matter of context, this is a religious symbol, etc. In my town you'd be lucky to make it home without an ass whooping. But I don't believe you would ever wear a swastika T-shirt in public regardless. Just words.

&gt;You are the one ignoring what is self evidently true. The KKK hood is by definition tied to the KKK and American quasi contemporary organisation. Otherwise it's just known as a hood.

You are the one ignoring what is self evidently true. The hijab is by definition tied to the misogyny within Islam and Islamic theocracies that mandate all women wear one under the threat of state-sanctioned violence. Otherwise it's just known as a head scarf.

&gt;Frankly it doesn't matter where you think it originated or why. 

Oh, it doesn't matter? Oh, okay. You've convinced me. Those are some mad debating skills you've got there.

&gt;What matters is that women are free to wear it or not of they want.

If you're taught from childhood that hell is a *real place,*--as real as the neighbor's house next door--AND you're taught that hell is where you will go if you don't cover your hair in public because the hair on your head is indecent and immodest and can not be seen by any man other than your husband or immediate blood relative, because it will provoke them to think sinful thoughts ... then do you really have much of a choice, if one of those choices is burning in agony forever?

In a way I suppose you do. Just as if I walked up to you and put a gun to your head and told you I would blow your brains all over the sidewalk if you did not do a pole dance, and you believed me, really *believed* I would do this ... I suppose you could still ""choose"" not to do the pole dance. But no one should be forced into doing something with a gun to their head *or* the threat of eternal damnation, because what this is in reality, is *coercion.* 

And yes, not all Muslim girls are taught that they will go to hell if they don't cover, and some willingly embrace the idea that there is something indecent about the hair on their heads, and some in the west wear the hijab as a ""cultural symbol of defiance"" against ""Islamophobia"" or, absurdly, as a sign of sisterhood with all the umma around the world even if hundreds of thousands of them are forced to wear the hijab under the constant threat of state-sanctioned violence.

But my sympathies do not lie with those women who freely choose to embrace what so many others experience as a direct expression of misogyny.

My sympathies lie with the women of Iran, of Saudi Arabia, of Afghanistan and Pakistan, and all the women around the world who are taught that there is something wrong with the hair on their heads.

&gt;And others are free to support them in that choice. Let's not forget it is frequently men attacking women, like the NZ pm, for supporting other women.

I don't actually see a point in this sentence. Who the fuck said you weren't free to support women who embrace a tool of oppression? Of course you are. Just as I am free to judge you a callous fool for doing so.

&gt;You have clearly lost the argument, so are resorting to ridiculous personal attacks and emotion.

Yes, wouldn't that be nice? Wouldn't it be nice if we could just declare ourselves the victor of any given debate and that would make it so?

""I am the winner!""

I can see why you would like it to be like that.

But it is not like that.

&gt;How on earth do you figure that. I'm entirely consistent and based on ethics.

You are ""based on ethics?"" What does that even mean?

&gt;I don't see why one women should be attacked for supporting another women, because it an entirely different country other women are attacked. That behaviour is unethical and inconsistent.

That sentence reads like you wrote down a bunch of words and threw them up in the air, and however they landed ... *that was your sentence.*

&gt;The irony is that those policing what women wear in places like Iran tend to sound like those policing what women wear in the West.

No, the irony is that there are those in the west who willingly embrace and defend a symbol of oppression to the entire female populations of other countries around the world.

I think misogyny is at the heart of this defense. Just as you would never countenance this kind of deeply sexist and oppressive thinking if it were coming from right wing Christians instead of Muslims, so too you would never find a way to excuse it if, instead of women, Muslims around the world promoted the idea that there was something indecent or immodest about the hair on the heads of black people , or gay people--or heaven forbid, *trans people.*

If it were almost *any* other oppressed group, you would probably have a harder time with it, because it would be so easy to see what was discriminatory about it.

But because it's women who overwhelming bear the brunt of this bullshit?

You're a-ok with it."
124,exyjp2t,"Yes, often extremely sorry, and in the case of islam I feel particularly sorry for the women, who so often barely have a life better than slavery in some countries. But if something poses a threat to you, feeling sympathy won’t fix anything. It really bothers me, for example, that the idea of women dressing ‘modestly’ (a bullshit euphemism if ever there was one) becomes somehow normalised in wider society, and I’ve been in schools where ‘modestly’ dressed muslim girls are in the majority. What does effect does that have on the non muslim girls, and thus their children and the wider community.

If you want to get into the really really ugly, google “bbc Birmingham UK schools lgbt protests” and read some of the stories. What the utterly vile protesters want is nothing less than the right to teach their children to think of  gay and transgender people as less than them, in accordance with the teachings of their religion. 

I don’t want people I know being pushed back into an age where they’re less free than they are now and with fewer rights, and islam would definitely be the vector for this (unless it changes markedly), because christianity is a spent force in Europe these days, and largely docile. So yes, empathy, but not to the point of moving up on the couch, rolling over and saying tickle my tummy."
125,f06rdgi,"Its a complicated relationship when women are beaten and killed in Iran and other nations for not wearing any covering.  A significant amount of women wearing coverings are doing so under threat of violence,rape,harassment, even legal enforcement because of its importance to the concept of ""modesty"".  Even in the west a significant amount of Muslim girls are wearing it out of fear of repercussions (although not as severe).  Celebrating it just normalized something used to oppress women.  

At the same time in Canada most women wearing Hijabs at least are doing so because its their choice and they like the style.  If their allowed to play basketball in the first place its likely just a style choice.  It normalized being Muslim in Canada which is a good thing.  Like Sikh headdress being accepted uniform.    


Either way Nike doesn't care at all."
126,eojw8ut,"&gt; They are actually about equivalent domestically.

No, they aren't. There are literally thousands of white militia groups, open marches, far more violence, and even many more deaths. 

&gt; But internationally it’s no contest.

Irrelevant.

&gt; But that’s beside the point here. I’m just saying: you guys often argue that because Harris hasn’t said anything about X, it says something about his secret motives.

He literally downplays the threat of white nationalism precisely to maintain his years of work overestimating the danger of Islam. It's obvious to anyone who hasn't gotten lost in this sewer.

&gt; But you never apply that same logic to those on your side who spend all their time worrying about, for example, white supremacy, when jihadism is just as much of an issue.

Muslim Americans are more liberal than Evangelicals. Stop. But you wouldn't know this if you listened to assholes like Douglas Murray or Ayaan, who Sam has defended for years."
127,ekuq6lq,The Islamic world attacked us on 9/11 and we have been at war with them ever since. However it is not true that Muslim Americans are under threat in America because we are a tolerant nation unlike every Muslim nation on Earth.
128,eftnd52,"&gt; Why do you think since the fall of the ottoman empire there has not been any islamic power anymore?

Rome fell in 400AD, and the region of former rome didn't see a stable empire until the 1400s.  That's what happens when Empires collapse and are either cannibalized by local rulers, or exploited by foreign ones.  

&gt; Islam has systemic errors that hinders progress.

then why do Muslims have no trouble ""progressing"" in the west?

&gt;Its not surprising that throwing western values over the railing due to incompatibility with sharia is crippling islamic countries.

except that Islam has adapted in the western world and is actually more ""western"" than most ""western"" people.

&gt;Even atatürk understood that by forcefully westernizing and secularising but it seems islam is clawing its way back in your country.

The young turks before him said the same, and they ""westernized"" by trying to purge all non-Muslims.  Even Attaturk did so with the Christian Turks and Greeks in anatolia.  The Young Turks were actually trying to turn their country into the French model of ethnic dominance, an idea that led to the Armenian genocide. 

&gt;your country

America?

&gt;Feminism and lgbqt is incompatible with sharia and islam claiming otherwise must be an elaborate joke.

The Muslim world at it's peak had tons of art and stories about homosexuality.  the concept of women owning property was first normalized by the Muslim empires.  slaves having to consent and be paid for sex is the first instance of legal prostitution in the region since the Roman Empire (and for the Romans, it was only the elite who could get away with such things).  

As I already mentioned, ALL congress-people in the US that are Muslim support LGBQT rights, and ALL Muslim MPs in germany voted in favor of gay marraige.

&gt;Can you also explain to me how the headscarf relates to that seen plenty in germany? 

Is there a law forcing women to wear the headscarf in Germany?  No. Because they CHOOSE to wear it.  A woman can be modest if she wants, but you seem to assume it means oppression?  There are well known Muslim activist leaders, both married and unmarried, with and without the headscarf in the US.  No one gives a shit.

&gt;Furthermore I would really like you to explain to me how being gay is compatible with sharia law.

Homosexuality in Islam was under the umbrella of adultery.  Anal sex is forbidden.  Over time, starting with the Ummayad dynasty (which was centered in mostly Christian Byzantium/modern Syria), countless falsified hadith began to arise, which had 2 things in common:  1) they worked to demand Muslims obey their political leaders, and 2) they incorporated many Middle Age Christian ideals into them.  These hadith lost popularity after the Ummayad's fell in a revolt (there are other things the Ummayad dynasty attempted to do, like demonize Ali Ibn Talib).  These hadith were not really popularly accepted until about the 1800s, when Hadith like ""Imam Ali threw gay men from roof tops"" and ""anyone who follows a woman is lost"" became popular with the Salafi movement.  The Salafi movement is the idea that Muslims should accept ALL hadith as valid, because we can't be 100% sure which are true or not.  So it's better to be safe and simply obey them all, since that's just being extra-devoted to God.

Homosexuality was also made a key focus of Sodom and Gammorah in the modern age, when the original intent of the story was about widespread hedonism leading to self-destruction.  homosexuality was one aspect of that.  It wasn't even a core aspect of it, it was just ""big orgies with everyone banging everyone"".

and adultery was a big deal because 1) it threatened the livelihood of a possible child, and 2) STDs.  before modern medicine and the industrial revolution, these things could collapse a society/city/tribe/clan/family.

&gt;Why do you think it is germany that muslim womans can express themselves?

Because there is no law stopping them from doing so.

&gt;Because they can get rid of their religion and violate its rules

The US has older Muslim communities that have been doing this for decades.  I literally watched my Muslim friends throw the religion wayside and turn into party animals, and I watched non-Muslims convert to Islam on their own accord.

&gt;because its not the majority religional and thus enforced, without getting killed over what is written in your book.

even the most religious Islamic governments try to avoid killing people for disobeying the religion.  They're just as scared of the threat of revolt as any other country.  "

131,edwm0d3,"&gt; Umm, what's your point? Those ""top people"" wrote the laws criminalizing homosexuality.

Yes, governments typically make laws. They are also generally supported by the people.

&gt;Do I really need to start citing persecution of homosexuals within the Muslim World? Please tell me you can use Google yourself.

You can deflect away from what I said if you want, but that doesn’t change the fact that Muslim Americans are more gay friendly than Protestant Americans. Is it that hard to accept?


&gt;I've traveled extensively in the South with my partner. We love it there, and faced no issues. When's the last time a gay was executed or thrown off a building there?

Congrats, you faced no issues from southern conservatives while you were in the South for two days. Unlike you, I actually live here and experience what it’s like in a conservative utopia.

&gt;I can only assume you're a sheltered white middle class liberal who isn't gay, and wants to play politics with my safety. You can honestly fuck off with your ignorance.

You’re a dual British/American that live in NYC and you’re calling me sheltered? 🤣

I’m a gay person living in a small town in the south, I know what Protestants and conservatives are like which is why I accept that conservatives are the biggest threat to people like me in America. The only people playing politics with you safety is yourself (assuming you’re actually gay).

&gt;You can honestly fuck off with your ignorance.

132,e86fznn,"The one time Trump actually acknowledged the LGBTQ community was during a rally during the campaign. He said the letters to “LGBT” as if he had never heard the abbreviation before, and he promised that he would protect it from hateful foreign ideologies. He was implying that any sort of threat to the LGBT community came from the outside—more specifically, from Islam.

So the one time he advocated for the community was wrapped up in a dog-whistle appeal to Islamophobia. That’s pretty rich coming from a guy who chose Mike Pence, the epitome of the hateful *domestic* ideology that threatens queer people, as his running mate.

Interestingly, Muslim Americans are now more likely to support same-sex marriage than Christian Americans. In other words, Trump is *completely* fine with homophobia when it comes from within. "

I told you what jihad is.  you just insist it's something else.  there are dozens of quotes from hadith and the quran about jihad, and you using the arabic term for the word ""struggle"" doesn't make it more magical or mystical.  War can be jihad, but so is an argument with a petty asshole on the internet.  it's not holy or divinely ordained or any of that other nonsense.  it's just the struggles of life.

&gt;Thanks for pointing out conflicting scripture and the conflicting meanings of Jihad, already stated that.

you see, buddy, words?  they have meanings.  they don't mean just one specific situation.  the word struggle does not mean holy war.  all religions use this term, to reference all the issues of life.  it's not contradictory just because you repeat it is over and over again.  it can apply to many situations and topics.  you're refusal to think critically or acknowledge context is not my problem.

&gt;You're in a post about a man tortured by a theocracy for reporting on human rights violations. You're quoting passages about tolerance and love from that religeon's doctrine and pointing out events a thousand yeard ago as somehow relevant. 

hold up.  if scripture says one thing, and a state does another thing, why is the scripture to blame, and not the state?  do you even heard yourself?

&gt;Theocracy tortures a man.

so do democracies.  and communist states.  and monarchies.  and literally every type of government in existence.  who's cherry picking now?

&gt;These attrocities and contradictions don't just exist within the Saudi Royal family or Saudi Arabia either. Get the fuck out

and they dont just exist within the governments of Muslim countries, too.  actually, American Muslims are less likely to be violent or advocate torture than any other religious group in America.

&gt;And for the record: Sparta was a matriarchal state

LMAO.  a state where a man had to force rape a woman to claim her as his wife was matriarchal?  ok, let's believe your lie for a moment, that Sparta was matriarchal.  did Sparta's culture spread throughout the globe?  do we still have to rape women to claim them as wives?  no.  the foundation of a worldwide movement to give women the right to own property only became mainstream because of Islam.  that's the first society to spread it beyond a city state or a nomadic tribe.  

&gt;Your statements support the idea of regressionistic Islam because you're pointing to statements of tolerance and culture compared to today's extremist intolerant views. That's what regression means.

all your posts focus on advocating that a group is evil, regressive, destructive, and unable to exist within whatever idea you have about a modern society.  You are literally advocating genocide and elimination of freedom of religion.  who's regressive?

&gt;My very first statement ""I know you're going to cherry pick contradictory statements from the quran"" so what do you do? You quote contradictory statements from the quran and present them as fact. 

you see, you can go to those quotes from the Quran, and check their context.  that's not what cherry picking means, which leads us to you actually cherry picking, and thus projecting onto me:

&gt;""Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things,"" (2:256)

the rest of the sentence is saying ""god knows all"".  it was irrelevant to the topic.  and doesn't contradict the part that says ""you can't force religion onto others"".

&gt;And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger, to the people (assembled) on the day of the Great Pilgrimage,--that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the Pagans. If then, ye repent, it were best for you; but if ye turn away, know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith,"" (9:3).

the term ""the pagans"" is written in Arabic to refer to a specific group.  After this revelation, Muhammad and the Muslims were still allied with other pagan tribes against the Meccan Qurayshi, who expelled the Muslims from Mecca, stole all of their property, and waged a war of extermination against them.  While in Medina, the Meccans waged a siege on Medina, and failed to capture the city. this led to a armistice treaty. After some years, the Muslims allied with a PAGAN tribe, which propmpted the Meccans to attack the tribe.  This is what caused the treaty to dissolve that this line refers to.

context.

&gt;But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practice regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful,"" (9:5).

here's the whole chapter for you:

 1. A declaration of immunity from God and His Messenger to the polytheists with whom you had made a treaty.

2. So travel the land for four months, and know that you cannot escape God, and that God will disgrace the disbelievers.

3. And a proclamation from God and His Messenger to the people on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage, that God has disowned the polytheists, and so did His Messenger. If you repent, it will be better for you. But if you turn away, know that you cannot escape God. And announce to those who disbelieve a painful punishment.

4. Except for those among the polytheists with whom you had made a treaty, and did not violate any of its terms, nor aided anyone against you. So fulfill the treaty with them to the end of its term. God loves the righteous.

5. When the Sacred Months have passed, kill the polytheists wherever you find them. And capture them, and besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every ambush. But if they repent, and perform the prayers, and pay the alms, then let them go their way. God is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.

there is a reason you skipped line 4.  it's because YOU ARE CHERRY PICKING.  I just proved it, clearly and without bias.  You quoted line 3, SKIPPED LINE 4, and then quoted line 5.  you did it intentionally, and with purpose.  this line is used by all of you Islamophobe bigots.  you think that your smart in using this?  your just another sheep, following what your told, because you can't let go of your misplaced hate.  

&gt;Sura 4:82 Do they not ponder on the Qur'an? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much discrepancy.

this line supports my position more than you.  People like you don't really ponder the Quran, you just parrot what youve read on anti-Islam websites.

&gt;Islam is the greatest MODERN threat to human rights and global progress. Events of hundreds of years ago are completely irrelivant. 

Islam has had the same scripture hundreds of years ago.  Also, Muslims have fought and killed more Muslims by far, than anyone else.  where is the threat?  Who's bombing the Muslim world with the strongest army in human history?  why is a majority of ISIS's guns made in America?  Why do Brazil and Mexico and many other SOuth American (non Muslim) countries have higher murder rates than death rates of SYRIA IN A LITERAL WARZONE?  

you clearly aren't here to actually debate anything.  you aren't trying to be reasonable, or rational, or logical.  you just want to spread hate.  I've provided evidence of how you are wrong, how you are cherry picking, and how you just repeat your opinions in each post.  you clearly aren't arguing in good faith.  So go ahead, respond with your points like ""NO YOU!"" and ""ISLAM IS BAD I PROVED IT!"".  you aren't getting another response from me.  "
134,e3g9kkr,"Agreed. However when you consider the savagery of recent attacks world wide, for example the victims of Paris, Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels, Nice, London, Manchester, New York, Moscow, Sydney, Afghanistan, Mumbai, Nigeria... etc. A Catholic priest having his head cut off in his own church, Christian churches being bombed in Cairo, the systemic extermination of Christian and other non muslim peoples populations in islamic nations. The enslavement of Yazidi women who are sold as sex slaves and are brutalized by their masters. The extreme forms of murder and torcher of homosexuals   and women who's only crime was to have been raped. And you can make the mental leap to equate this small example of the last 3 years with right wing Christian extremists then I feel you are wilfully not understanding the issue. Its not the same league, jesus its not the same sport. Buddhist monks in Myanmar kill more people than all the right wing Christian nut jobs but you don't care about that you bring up Brevik because you presumed me to be Christian and therefore try and say all fundamentalists are horrible so like It's all just as bad as each other regardless of the huge disparaging gulf between them. And yes I agree they are horrible but the islamic believers are not considered fundamentalists when they agree that homosexuality is punishable by death because a huge majority of muslims in the world this is what they feel and believe or when a woman should be stoned to death for adultery or if someone leaves the faith they too must be murdered. These are widely held beliefs in islam all over the world. Any other religion would be considered fundamentalists and extremist for even considering these tenets, and yet islam makes them part of the core belief system. This faux equivalency is facile beyond belief. The sheer numbers of attacks the distaine for life, the savagery and the one constant, islam. No it's not irrational to fear islam, it's the biggest threat to western civilisation in the world today. Not just because of several million jihadists but because of the wahhabism influence backed by Saudi money and radicalisation of muslims everywhere. Let's not forget the Manchester bomber was rescued from Libya by the British navy and brought home mirroring his parents escape from Gaddafi in the 1980's when they too were given asylum. Yet he grows up to be a guy who blows himself up at a teenagers concert? To a nation that gave him the very ability to be born in the first place? These are not outlying examples. This is pure islam. As an ideology it's terrifying. A brutal authoritarian fascist system where non muslim girls are groomed, drugged, raped, pimped and sold in their 1000's in towns like Rotherm and Telford and many others. There are muslim gang rape cases going on it 58 British town and city's at this very moment. Sweden has stopped recording rape and gang rape statistics on muslim immigrants because the were involved in over 90% of all gang rapes. The same in Germany mass sexual assaults in Köln as well as other german citys on NYE 2015 and rape statistics are also rising at a frightening rate. A Köln police office leaked a report after the mass attack that trukish men in the Köln police  area were suspected in nearly 70% of all rapes in the year beforehand. These attacks are targeted at mostly white European girls and women, non muslims. These are not extremist these 'men' are following the teaching of mohamed where women and girls as young as 9 are there to be raped and used. 
Islam needs to go through a reformation and enlightenment before it will be compatable with the West. Untill then it has to be kept at arms length and resisted at all cost. 
Imagine a nice green fresh looking apple, you bite into it and its completely rotten on the inside.

135,e1gih6y,"&gt;Alright well you clearly don't care about any legal reasoning amd think you know better than the SC.

You act like the S.C decision was a unanimous vote; it was 5 v 4.  You’d be justified in saying I’m acting like I know better than the S.C if the vote was unanimous.  Four justices sided against.  Sotomayor reportedly,

&gt;dismissed the majority’s conclusion that the government succeeded in arguing that the travel ban was necessary for national security. She said that no matter how much the government tried to “launder” Mr. Trump’s statements, “all of the evidence points in one direction.” Justice Sotomayor accused her colleagues in the majority of “unquestioning acceptance” of the president’s national security claims. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Justice Sotomayor’s dissent. Source: [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-travel-ban.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-travel-ban.html)  
&gt;  
&gt;I see no reason to keep talking past each other here. Go right on trying to read the president's mind.

I’m not reading his mind. Trump’s record of anti-Muslim statements is long and well documented and I’ve brought that up at multiple points only for it to be ignored and met with the snarky reply “ha ha I take it you can read the president’s mind”.  It doesn’t require a mind reader to see that Trump made being anti-Muslim a selling point of his campaign.

Ultimately what this debate comes down to is the motivation for the executive order.  I’ve already given a large host of reasons as to why the explanation that the ban is about human rights abuses and hostility is a load of bunk, and explaining why I think it targets Muslims.  Reasons which you have opted to ignore repeatedly.  I will post them again to give you the chance of a reply:

&gt;**Taken all together, we have a ban that Trump previously called a ""Muslim ban"", that primarily targets Muslim-majority countries, that punishes vast swaths of people for no apparent reason, we have a stated explanation that makes no sense, we have Trump's history of anti-Muslim statements, and lastly further mystifying Trump’s motivation is the fact that we already had a working two year immigration process with background checks. If the motivation isn't some kind of misinformed mistrust of Muslim immigrants, please tell me what it is because it defies rational explanation. Back to the original question, though, an executive order is unconstitutional if it ""has the purpose and effect of disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state law"". Muslim Americans are legally recognized. Given all of the information listed above, by implementing a complete ban on immigration, and taken in conjunction with Trump’s stereotypical rhetoric about Muslims, it becomes clear that the ban lumps all Muslim immigrants together as a danger or threat to our country, even though all evidence points to the opposite. For American Muslims this has the effect of spreading the message that they’re viewed with suspicion by the American government. One could say it has the effect of “disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state law”.**"
136,e1s57lx,"Seems pretty realistic to me

&gt;“Nearly two and a half centuries ago, a band of patriots gathered in Philadelphia to declare that ‘all men are created equal.’ Our nation has changed dramatically since those words were first written on parchment. Generations of brave Americans – from service members to civil rights activists – have fought to expand the promise of equality for more Americans and move our country forward in its march toward a more perfect union.

&gt;“As we celebrate our nation’s independence, we recognize that America’s founding promise remains out of reach for too many families. Too many members of our society are still struggling to find a good-paying job or get the health care they need. Too many women, LGBTQ Americans, people of color, and people with disabilities still face inequality and injustice across our society.

&gt;“Everywhere we look, our most fundamental values are under attack. Thousands of children have been separated from their parents at our southern border. At our highest court, workers' rights are being taken away, voting rights are under assault, Muslim Americans are being discriminated against for their faith, and women's right to choose is under threat like never before.

&gt;“The Democratic Party believes that all people are created equal – no matter who they are, where they come from, who they love, or how they pray. As we celebrate our nation's independence, Democrats reaffirm our commitment to fighting for the values of inclusion and opportunity for everyone.""

137,e1tv6u8,"&gt;  At our highest court, workers' rights are being taken away, voting rights are under assault, Muslim Americans are being discriminated against for their faith, and women's right to choose is under threat like never before.  
  
By workers' rights, they mean unions' right to compel workers to join.  By voting rights, they mean gerrymandering to their liking.  By Muslim Americans, they mean Muslim who want to come to America.  By women's right to choose they mean a woman's right to kill her child.  Their ""rights"" suck.  "

It's possible that the local Muslim guy at the kebab shop is nice to customers. He's a human being who smiles, serves food, and pays his taxes. There's nothing wrong with these things, but the underlying problem is Islam on a religious, political, and historical level. In Quran 3:32, ""...***Allah does not like the unbelievers***."" In Quran 98:6, ""***Unbelievers from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and polytheists will live in the fire of hell. They are the worst of all creatures***.""

(**2**) Islam is not a religion of unconditional peace. In Quran 60:8, ***""Allah does not stop you from acting kind to unbelievers who won't put up a fight over Islam and will leave you alone in your homes.""*** It sounds good if they're going to be ""kind"" to us, right? But notice how peace is allowed with only the quiet ones. In Quran 4:148, ***""Allah does not like the public mention of evil"".*** This is a hate speech law.

(**2**) Islam is not a religion of unconditional peace. In Quran 60:8, ""***Allah does not stop you from acting kind to unbelievers who won't put up a fight over Islam and will leave you alone in your homes***."" It sounds good if they're going to be ""kind"" to us, right? But notice how peace is allowed with only the quiet ones. You're not given the freedom of speech to criticize Islam in a religious debate. You're [not allowed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/16/pakistan-man-sentenced-to-death-for-ridiculing-prophet-muhammad-on-whatsapp) to draw a cartoon of Muhammad. In Quran 9:29, ""***Fight those who do not believe in Allah... until they give the jizya willingly while they are humbled***."" Unbelievers can have peace as long as they pay a tax called ""jizya."" Every mention of ""peace"" in the Quran is tied to certain [terms and conditions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkOPHu1w73Q&amp;t=44s) that ensure Islam is the dominant force.

(**3**) The liberal wants to defend the poor, innocent refugee against the big, bad bully (conservatives). Yes, we criticize the ideology, but we are not necessarily against the individual. It's possible that the local Muslim guy at the kebab shop is nice to customers. He's a human being who smiles, serves food, and pays his taxes. There's nothing wrong with these things, but the underlying problem is with Islam on a religious, political, and historical level. In Quran 3:32, ""...***Allah does not like the unbelievers***."" In Quran 98:6, ""***Unbelievers from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and polytheists will live in the fire of hell. They are the worst of all creatures***."" In Quran 3:28, ""***Muslim brothers must not put an unbeliever above other Muslims. Whoever does that will never be helped by Allah***...""

154,drmlk3r,"&gt; Clinging to my hatred of fascism is something I’m very proud of and Islam is the worlds greatest fascist threat.

then why were the worst fascist leaders all secular and from non muslim countries?

&gt;The evidence for Islamic rape gangs in the UK (and other civilised countries stupid enough to allow unrestricted Islamic infestation) is simply undeniable. 

and in two posts, you've shown me no evidence. if it's so undeniable, you'd be able to show me a government statistic, but here you are, just shitting up words. 

&gt;who hate all women in general (as their faith commands) 

oh look at that, some more lack-of-proof.

oh, really? 

https://www.dawn.com/news/696084/of-aishas-age-at-marriage

she was 17-19 according to many hadith and secular scholars. 

&gt;And to what do you account the intellectual and scientific death in Islamic countries if the Quran is such an enthusiastic supporter of basking difficult questions?

regions rise and fall. europe was the same religion in the middle ages, and they were extremely backwards (least advanced region in the world). they're still christian today, so what changed? 

the muslim world was at the forefront of science in the abbasid and peak of the ottoman empire. what changed? not the religion. 

i think instead of desperately trying to claim its islam, you instead focus on things like all the invasions and lack of government services (like education) and all bombings and puppet dictators. 

you should also know muslims in the US have the second highest rate of college graduation by percent (jews are slightly higher). if muslims hate knowledge so much, why are they hugely successful in the US medical and engineering fields? why are american muslims more likely to reject violence, and vote for liberal politicians?

155,dli4rs1,"Oh wo wir gerade bei dem Thema sind, quote ich mal einen meiner Lieblingscomments:

**Predominantly Muslim Societies Reject Violence at Least as Much as Other Societies**

 - Since 9/11, voices arguing that Islam encourages violence more than other religions have grown louder - most recently in the manifesto penned by Anders Breivik before he gunned down more than 70 people in Norway. In his manifesto, Breivik argues that Islam is intrinsically violent and peaceful Muslims are simply ignoring their faith's injunctions to kill. He cites dozens of European and American pundits to support this assertion. If this popular claim were true, it would logically follow that Islam's adherents would be more likely than others to condone violence, even if most find it easier not to follow through on their beliefs, as Breivik contends.

 - The evidence refutes this argument. Residents of the Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states are slightly less likely than residents of non-member states to view military attacks on civilians as sometimes justified, and about as likely as those of non-member states to say the same about individual attacks.
 
 - Gallup Polling tells us that Muslim-Americans are less likely to agree that targeting civilians is ever acceptable than other religious groups, including atheists! Pew Polling shows that there are only a handful of countries (Afghanistan and the Palestinian Territories, for example) where Muslims were as accepting of non-military groups killing civilians as American atheists!

157,diqt9tw,"If you are actually seeking to understand, then what you need to understand is that you are framing the problem wrong. 

First, as a non-Muslim, I recognize that any criticisms I have of Islam will fall on totally deaf ears within Muslim communities. Me and every other white North America can't change Islam through Critique. 

What goes on in other countries around the world is largely none of my business. Call me a nationalist or whatever, but what I care about is what happens here in my own country, those other countries have to sort out that crap for themselves. 

People that live here and are Muslim, are citizens, and that comes first. They are my countrymen, and are to be defended on that basis. 

When you say 'no reciprocity on the other side', you seem to be equating American liberals defending American Muslim's freedom to worship with how other random countries out there in the world treat their people, and again, I don't care about Tunisia or the public opinion polls in Afghanistan. 

Muslims in America also do not exert any considerable political, social, or economic influence, and public policy isn't 'bending to the wishes of Islam' in any significant way. There is a clear arc which women's rights and LGBT rights are on in the US and in Canada, and the main place from which that is being threated is *not* the Muslim population here. Christian conservatism is still a vastly greater threat to the rights of women and LGBT people here, and that's important. 

Muslims are also a 'racialized' group. The way supposedly anti-Islamic sentiment is unleashed is often as discrimination or even violence against 'Muslim-looking' people. The fact that Sihks and Hindus are some times attacked points out that this is far more an issue of racism than about conflicting ideology. Defending Muslims here is far more about defending people from the injustice of racism, than about defending a religion. Though still the free practice of a religion is a basic thing within the liberalism going all the way back, and that doesn't just apply to which sect of Christianity you want to be, that means religion period, and as such a good liberal has a moral obligation to defend the natural rights of their fellow citizens, and that includes Muslims. 

If what we want is to change the sentiment of Muslims here to make them more accepting of things like LGBT people, then the best treatment is exposure therapy. I heard this heartwarming story from somewhere in Canada where a smallish town welcomed the incoming Syrian refugees by getting all the kids hockey sticks and teaching them to skate. By welcoming them all into the community like that there is no choice but to assimilate to some degree. By becoming friends and neighbours with LGBT people, and dealing with women in positions of authority the sort of views that are endemic where they are from are confronted in them, without any need for an assault on ""Islam"". And if those ideas aren't purged from them, they're kids will be a lot closer to it then them. That's really been the case for centuries of immigrants. By the time you are a third generation immigrant, you are pretty well assimilated and will grow up with views matching your peers. From a purely pragmatic point of view, it needs to be recognized that the more Islam and Muslims are publicly attacked in the US the more the Muslim communities here will choose to close off, and associate less and less with the non-Muslim population for fear of violence and discrimination, which is the total opposite of what you want from the perceptive of seeking assimilation. The more comfortable and able Muslim Americans are to become neighbors and friends with non-Muslims, the quicker the process of assimilation will go.

159,dj1kcmj,"Nah, the left has plenty of experience dealing with theocrats looking to erode civil rights and not afraid to turn to violence to do so.

The microscopic threat a few individuals might entail does not shake the tree of liberty.

If we decided to clean house, regular American far right is a vastly larger danger. Muslims arent looking to take away healthcare, or pass a law allowing discrimination by buisiness on ""religious"" grounds to attack LGBT citizens.

You folks are much more dangerous to health and liberty. 99.9% of Muslim Americans are delightful in comparison.
"
160,djchv2k,"&gt;Does this make sense? Is it too ridiculous?

Yeah, makes perfect sense to me.


&gt;I am not a person of hate because I disagree with Islam or atheism. I would only be a person of hate if that influenced the way I treat them. If that meant that I wouldn't hire them for jobs in the secular marketplace or I would segregate them and treat them differently politically. 

I guess this is what I still have difficulty with. All our scientific evidence points to seeing others as part of a group that is ""wrong"" or ""inferior"", automatically creates bias and prejudiced treatment even if we aren't aware of it.

Ideally I believe that put should value every religion as deeply as their own. Religion is a very personal choice, and we can't KNOW which is correct. We can know which is correct to us and speaks to us and what we believe, but to tell others that they are wrong only naturally causes division and hate. 

Part of the reason hatred of differences is increasing is because we no longer see our beliefs as opinions but rather as facts that others are wrong about. We see this with religion, politics, philosophy, and even personal taste. We have been so caught up in our own circles that we forget we have no more right to our beliefs than others to their own.

I'm as guilty as anyone else. It's really really REALLY hard for me not to disrespect Trump supporters and dismiss them as idiots. I see so much suffering that their beliefs cause, so much anti-science, so much anti-rationality, that it is impossible for me not judge the followers of Trump worse than I am.

Just like you in regards to religion, I will never truly believe that Trump supporters are equally correct as I am. However I know and believe they are not less human then I am. Nonetheless, as someone wants to be just, kind, and open I have to constantly challenge my own biases to avoid doing so. Not being prejudicial isn't something that is natural or comes easy. It's something we have to combat day in and day out.  
For example ""color blind"" people are some of the most racist based on empirical evidence. They just assume that they aren't racist and believe they treat everyone equally which allows that bias to run unchecked.


The only way to combat our prejudice is to admit we have it.

Muslims actually have much greater tolerance for other religions  than Christians. This is a natural consequence of them disagreeing with Christians and Jews but also believing that they are also seeking god and don't deserve to be punished for their beliefs (in life or death).


""In a 2011 study on Muslim-Americans, researchers found that the vast majority of participants said they felt extremely safe prior to 9/11. Following the attack, 82 percent of them felt “extremely unsafe.” The researchers later found many of those studied developed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder from this constant anxiety and abuse.
And a 2013 study of Muslim women in the United Kingdom who had been the victims of an Islamophobic attack found that nearly all of the women “expressed feelings of humiliation, anger, sadness, isolation, and disgust.” Some of them said they became afraid to leave their home because of this.""


http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00911.x/full

Even completely secular critiques show a moderate association with islamophobia. They also found that non- Muslim religious individuals showed greater bias against Islam and less likely to fairly critique them.


""Gallup finds Muslim Americans, however, are among the most integrated religious groups in the U.S. Gallup Religious Tolerance Index, which measures people's attitudes toward religious faiths different from their own and ranks survey respondents by three categories: Isolated, Tolerant, and Integrated people (see sidebar for definitions).

Among U.S. religious groups, 44% of Muslim Americans are integrated, on par with Mormons (46%) and greater than Jewish Americans (36%), Protestants (35%), and Catholics (34%).

When examining religious tolerance globally, the U.S. and Canada and sub-Saharan Africa rate as the most integrated regions Gallup studied. Respondents from sub-Saharan Africa are also most likely to explain the root causes of tensions between Muslim and Western societies as religious. MENA and Asia are the most isolated regions, along with Europe and the former Soviet Union.

Muslim respondents globally are no different from Western societies in their level of integration and openness to people of other faiths.""

""The Muslim populations in France, Germany, and the U.K. are less likely than the general public in these countries to say those with differing religious practices threaten their way of life.""

Yet

""Significant proportions of the French, German, and British publics consider different Muslim practices and relationships threatening. For example, 16% of Germans, 30% of British, and 39% of French say that wearing the hijab - the traditional head covering worn by Muslim women - is a threat to European culture. Similar proportions associate Muslims with terror, as 23% of Germans, 25% of the French, and 34% of the British say that Muslims are sympathetic to al Qaeda.

Overall, however, large majorities of French (90%), British (90%), and German (95%) respondents say they have not experienced racial or religious discrimination in the past year. Among Muslims in each of these three countries, those in France and Germany are significantly more likely than the general population to say they experienced discrimination in the past year.""

""Between 16% and 21% of people in France, Germany, and the U.K. say they would not like Muslims as their neighbors, similar to the percentages of each country's general population that say they would not like homosexuals as neighbors.""

I can’t really comment on that because as soon as you’re born here in America, they do it. So everybody is circumcised, not just Muslims."
162,ez1nxj2,"&gt; when that's the case and it's proven

https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/un-report-on-racial-disparities/

In particular, I'd like you to scroll down to the bullet points about drugs, particularly marijuana, and the unequal rates of car searches. The war on drugs massively increased the prison population.

&gt; Also, it's funny that you include Men in there considering the vitriol men endure from the left pretty often when they bring up these issues (MRAs)

Why is it funny? I am in full support of a lot of MRA talking points. Men do get shafted in a lot of things, and being given harsher sentences than women for the same crimes is one of them. I don't associate with far-left idiots, every one of my left-leaning friends would agree that harsher sentencing for men is unfair. 

&gt; But obviously my summary is going to be a bit lacking in nuance...

Yes, but it's lacking in nuance in just the right ways to try to make the conservative platform look better. Was that not an intentional choice? It took me a paragraph to explain the liberal platform in a way that treated it fairly.

&gt; Funnily enough ... but the communities.

Why should that open my eyes to anything? Having a black president does not automatically make the entire system grind to a halt and reverse. Having black people in positions of power does not immediately fix anything. And if those in positions of power are not interested in fixing anything, it'll stay that way forever.

Interlude: Later on in your response, you make a claim that contradicts the argument I'm making here. I wrote this before reading the second message. My response to your point about immigrant blacks and communist survivors is this: I'm going to need proof of your claim that social support causes economic immobility in the lower class. There are several things that happened in the 70s and 80s that can account for the sudden downturn in social mobility in America. One of them is the start of the war on drugs.

https://www.businessinsider.com/the-american-dream-of-social-mobility-2017-3

Just from casual observation, it seems like the most socially immobile states are 1. former slave states, and 2. red urban states (vs red rural states). California would be expected to have absolutely atrocious social mobility, but it actually has the highest urban state mobility in America. Something I noticed was that the democrat central area of North Carolina (my home state) is ever-so-slightly more mobile than the rest of it.

And I already mentioned that there is a socioeconomic component. As for ""community"", culture is informed by the stressors put on it. For example, you see far fewer parents in middle class communities encouraging their children to go straight into service work out of high school. Why? Because there's no economic stressors that threaten homelessness if they have to support/feed someone not working full time through college. From experience, the reason a higher percentage of poor people in my HS didn't go to college is because they were too busy helping their family stay afloat. If not for Obamacare I might not have made it, as my mom needed emergency surgery and subsequent medication a few years back that would've financially crippled her. 

I digress, but I'm sure that I'll have to hop back to this later. The point is that culture is shaped by its stressors. Why is there more violence in urban poor areas? Is it that living wage is disproportionately higher in urban areas, encouraging drug-dealing and crime? Is it that because of unequal police activity (and laws, take a look at the difference in charges between crack cocaine and pure cocaine), more black people have criminal records and thus are blocked from meaningful employment? Could the unequal police activity and abhorrent school conditions create a feeling of distrust for authority? Could it be a mix of all of these? Is this something that just telling them to suck it up and deal is gonna fix? I don't think it will. 

&gt; I gave you clear examples of what I was talking about and you chose to go for the extremes.

You just gave me that you think the black community is violent. You didn't say why, then asked if you were racist, so I used an example of a racist reason to feel that way and a non-racist reason to feel that way. I'm sorry if it came off as extreme, I did not intend it as such.

&gt; Black families were more likely to be married and united during the slave eras than they are now. It's a fucking outrage that should have every kid born in a dysfunctional family raging.

Everyone was more married and united during the slave eras than they are now. Because there wasn't a lot of choice not to be. Production of offspring was the only way to get new slaves after import was stopped, so marrying off your property was a good idea.

But yeah, the average is 34% and African-Americans have 65%. Fertility is declinining sharply among American women and has been for a while, though. So I don't think they're taking advantage of the alleged government subsidation as much as you'd think.

&gt; yeah, context matters. A religion that literally preaches that the infidels must be killed. It's not just a belief in a sky daddy. it's a belief that women are inferior to men. It's a belief that pushes that Ilhan Omar should be stoned to death for adultery.

We can get into a discussion on Christianity's statements on women and stoning, if you'd like. What's written in the book is, by and large, not what moderates follow. Take a look at WBC or New York's Orthodox Jewish population for some great examples of non-Islamists who follow their holy book a bit too much. Take a look at this: https://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/political-and-social-views/

Muslims are only trailing the US general public by about 11% on acceptance of homosexuality. That's 63% to 52%, hardly enough to make broad judgements about them. Go on to the next page to read about opinions of extremism, after that there's religious practices. 42% of Muslim women in the US never wear a hijab. This view that Muslim Americans are somehow super extreme in their views, as if they lived in the Middle East where it's actually codified into law, is simply incorrect. 

&gt; I'm not sure if you're trying to poison the well

I wasn't, I was exaggerating. You can amend it to ""Go back to Africa!"" if you'd like. Same point still applies. It's racist and anti-American."
163,ete9iu5,"""Anyone outside of country or anti-american, I don't care about."" Okay so we agree, Muslim americans are americans.

""I don't care if they're here, but if they try to change the way our society runs, threaten us, or do anything worse, I'm not backing down. This goes for everyone"" I never objected to this idea? This is what I think as well, if someone is advocating for radical ideals such as universal sharia law I won't defend them. If a Muslim who lives in America aligns themselves with western values then I will defend them. Western civilization is great and I'll do what I can to defend its ideals. Your comment however states ""Muslims as a whole are bad"" which is something I object to. 

Also I don't think Islam is completely innocent, but your comment showed that you had a few ideas about Islam that as far as my knowledge goes simply aren't true. Hell, I'll cede that many Muslims condone violence against gays, I'll cede that many Muslims wish violence upon infidels, and in many countries they're the majority. But in the west, there are a lot of Muslims who are good people and are willing to align themselves with our values, and that's why I take issue with the comment ""Muslims as a whole are bad."" My position is that there are many radical Muslims out there and we should be weary of that, but that doesn't mean Muslims are incompatible with our society, which is the message I was getting from your comment

""And I did comment back"" Well I never got a notification for some reason"
164,frsaysz,"&gt; india is the most dangerous country for women .

More than Afghanistan, where the Taliban doesn't even allow women to have an education, or Saudi Arabia where they can't even step out of the house without a male escort or Iraq which is a goddam war zone, or Syria where they were literally captured and sold as sex slaves at the time of this report, or Pakistan where underage non Muslim girls are kidnapped, raped, forcibly converted and married to their rapists in broad daylight.

Yeah, that makes total sense.

If you had read your own source, you would have known that the entire report is based on opinion of the consulted individuals.

[And not even an opinion based on accurate facts at that.](https://youtu.be/hc42V3WzAwA?t=167) Weird that you didn't know that.

Or maybe you didn't want to.

And I have seen a number of Muslims being bigots to non Muslims and LGBT people. Should I jeer about their ""culture?""

Go to r/islam and filter by keyword. You will have enough material for a lifetime. Of course we both know that you won't. That would be ""stereotyping.""

Your criteria for ""stereotypes"" and their application is weirdly selective.

166,erq2mhv,"The arguments are centered around the  belief that there are good people and bad people.All muslim people  are inherently seen as good as per indoctrination since childbirth.They are good as they follow islam as its good. If all muslims are good then all non-muslims are either ignorant or bad. 

Exmuslims are not ignorant therefore they must be bad and hence against islam. Furthermore since the anti-muslim Americans are also bad(against muslims) they are essentially the same.

&amp;#x200B;

This thought process is subconscious and happens immediately. Thus exmuslims are allies and benefactors of the racist americans. Hence the above commits a false dichotomy fallacy, he generalizes all exmuslims as bad.

&amp;#x200B;

The justifcation is then brought up afterwards. All exmuslims are bad (inherent) =&gt; they are all tools of racists(implied since they are both bad) =&gt; they probably hate the photos(implied through relation)

This in an inherent flaw of the human brain, we are quick to generalize groups of people into black and [white.It](https://white.It) is cognitively easier and holds slight merit since if one lion eats your friend its safer to assume all are dangerous.

Your comment is trying to argue with someone arriving from the point -- All exmuslims are bad --- you are arguing against a 10-20 year old view point hammered into people since birth.

167,ejp9461,"Yeah I understand what you say, but the circumstances today are worse than a war. If muslims (including innovators) united during the time of war then it is even more important to do today. 
Here is why : 

50% of the muslim world population are youth. Islam is the youngest religion in the world. The average age is insanely low. There are close to a billion muslim youth who are being bombarded daily with other ideologies such as liberalism and feminism. It is much much worse than a war. If in the period of war enemies lived across the border. In today’s world, enemies have found their way within your home. The pervasiveness of media in our everyday life has made it soo easy to be influenced by new ideologies. How many parents are unaware of what happening in their own homes. Their kids are playing video games with atheists and communicating with them … And that’s how they get exposed to dangerous ideologies, add this to the fact that islam is ridiculed all over these media … No wonder children have doubts. They don’t know who to believe anymore. Peer pressure makes their situation worse, they don’t want to be the only person who are “different”, they don’t want to stand out, and many of them accept the media narrative and the things they have been exposed to. Some of them have internalised that they should support homosexuality, then they see their religion condemning it. Young muslim girls are questioning the validity of the Hijab, they have internalised that it’s oppressive because that’s what they keep hearing feminists say. No wonder brother that the young leave the religion. This is happening everyday, and everyday we lose thousands of youth (the silent majority) to liberalism, atheism … 

At least back in the day, even at times of war, there was no way for toxic ideologies to get inside your home if you so wished to. Today we don’t have that luxury anymore. What is happening today is an ideological war, and that is far far worse than actual war. This is why I agree with brother Hijab. It is actually insane that muslims quarrel and debate between themselves, while this haemorrhage of youth is happening under their noses. 

I also was surprised brother Hijab didn’t mention this Hadith that makes end to the discussion :

Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, ""I guarantee a house in Jannah for one who gives up arguing, even if he is in the right; and I guarantee a home in the middle of Jannah for one who abandons lying even for the sake of fun; and I guarantee a house in the highest part of Jannah for one who has good manners."""
168,ek717g6,"&gt; Then you also have the studies that came out that listed India as the most dangerous country for women.

That study was a joke, and a bad one at that.

Are you seriously going to tell me that India is somehow *worse* for women than Afghanistan, which is controlled in large parts by the Taliban, ISIS controlled Iraq and Syria, where women were captured and sold as sex slaves, Saudi Arabia, where women are forbidden to even step out of the house without male supervision, and Pakistan where up to a thousand underage non Muslim girls are kidnapped, forcibly converted and forcibly married to their kidnapper in broad daylight?"
169,ehctpho,"It's classic in-group out-group tribalism. 

For anti-gun leftists, *guns themselves* are practically an out-group--they're dangerous, mysterious objects possessed by dark magic and evil spirits, which requires a member of the priestly class--police, soldiers, other members of the elite sanctioned by Our Lord and Saviour the State--to cleanse them and make them safe. In fairness, only the most overly-emotional, irrational gun haters buy into this, that guns themselves are the out-group which ought to be banished from Our Tribe, though such people do definitely exist.

The more common sort of person is someone who believes *gun owners* are the out-group, a group of people who deserve no recognition from the tribe, no protection from the tribe, and could very well be an enemy of the tribe who need to be driven out of existence.

Hence why anti-gun leftists can be in favor of banning guns (or, more realistically, banning legal gun owners) while being against the Muslim Ban while thinking they hold consistent beliefs: because Muslims (certainly Muslim-Americans) are member of the in-group, but guns/gun owners are not. Therefore Muslims deserve protection of the tribe, gun owners do not. 

I draw this conclusion based on my interactions with conservatives while debating immigration. Their stance on immigration violates many of their stated principles, yet they see no hypocrisy or contradiction in their own beliefs because immigrants are not in the conservative in-group and hence are worthy of no protections derived from other conservative principles."
170,dy7t5dr,"&gt; What the hell are you talking about? This is a perfect example.

perfect example of what? no one has criticized islam or muslims yet in this part of the thread. i'm pointing out what Azlan is actively targeting. 

&gt;I never even said anything about exclusively male genital mutilation

you brought up genitals dude. what a horrible game of semantics you're playing. 

&gt;you are a dangerous fanatic yourself.

and there it is. thank you for exposing his bigoted you actual are. 

&gt;You insisting that mulims who commit genital mutilation aren't real muslims doesn't matter at all. It's o true scotsman.

i'm pointing out facts. hadith considered reliable forbids it. FGM is done by mostly tribal groups, who are muslim, christian and pagan. and yet YOU insisted it was a muslim thing from the start. that's called a bias, and it comes from a position of bigotry. 

&gt;I don't care what YOU think the scripture says

you don't care what the foundation of the religion says solely because i'm pointing it out? why? what motive do you have to insist scripture says what it doesn't? again, we all know your motive. 

&gt;You are probably not even a muslim. 

i am. born and raised. in a large muslim american community, that is majority american born. i studied the history of islam as my major. i teach history in a school with one of the largest percentage of muslim students. i know islam. you do not. 

&gt;And when did the ""new age fo Islam"" begin, huh?

with the rise of salafism in the 1800s, and the idea of Islamic nationalism. 

&gt;Are you saying that instead of reforming, Islam is going backwards and regressing?

all civilizations go in cycles of progress and decline. or prosperity and stagnation. islam is not a civilization. the majority muslim states are currently on the receiving end of imperialism. muslims outside of this region (and even within it but that's a whole different discussion) do not share the same philosophies and viewpoints with those inside this region. it's a diverse religion that is decentralized. no mosque has authority over another. every muslim can pick up the quran and come
to their own conclusions without a leader or scholar. 

&gt;How do you zealots come up with this drivel?

it's called history. it's sad you consider academia zealotry. 

 &gt;What are you even trying to say? How are American muslims different? There is just one kind of muslim in US?

https://niskanencenter.org/blog/muslim-americans-are-more-likely-to-reject-violence-intolerance-than-many-americans/

american muslims also have the second highest rate of higher education by religion, only jews gave higher rates. 

&gt;70% of muslims in US voted for Bush Jr. 

i can't find a source on this. but muslims were a conservative voting bloc starting with the reagan era...when EVERYONE was voting ""conservative"". if anything, this shows that muslims are swayed by american culture (in the US) more than anything else. because Reagan and the Republicans were doing A LOT of shitty things to middle eastern countries. 

also, ALL muslim MPs in germany voted in favor of gay marriage. muslims tend to vote more socialist in general. here's a study about muslim voters that occurred in 2016, not almost 20 years ago.

"
171,dvpopxl,"&gt;The US has 27 rapes per 100,000 and Hong Kong has 1.4. So that must mean that Buddhists rape less than Christians. We can't let Christians into our country

You're being very dishonest.  I have **repeatedly** said that I do not want to stop *all* Muslim immigration.  This distinction in assault levels is due to Christianity being a much more sexist and violent religion than Buddhism, thus warranting greater skepticism toward the former.

&gt;I just think it's dubious to make a generalization about one culture being more prone to rape or homophobia.

It absolutely is not.  All cultures are not equal.

&gt;Like you said, Muslim Americans are more tolerant than Christian Americans. It has nothing to do with their Christian-ness or Muslim-ness.

That's because America has immigration restrictions that select for which people (Muslims included) we allow into the country.

&gt;I did respond to that. I said the Native Americans did fight back and killed a lot of settlers. They just didn't have suicide vests at the time.

Admittedly, I could have been more clear and detailed in answering, so see my other reply for my refutation to this.

&gt; I guess I just wonder what you think a rational response to genocide should be.

Calling the situation in the ME ""genocide"" is ridiculous.

&gt;And I still don't see why that matters really, I tend to agree with Russel Brand here. We fetishize suicide bombings.

I answered this.  Martyrdom in Islam is rewarded greatly in the afterlife, and someone with no value on their life is impossible to dissuade.

&gt;American Indians had blown themselves up in crowded saloons or whatever, would you think that they were doing it for political reasons or would you think that it was because of their paganism?

If their ""paganism"" directly encouraged and rewarded killing infidels, and they started pushing dangerous beliefs perfectly in line with their holy book, I'd sure as hell would think it was a big part."
172,dvw3dgr,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_banned_from_entering_the_United_Kingdom

173,djuu844,"&gt; It is not about sex so much as about the circumstances in their home country. Update me when these professional gamers are coming from countries where their profession exposes them to life threatening political and social forces and on the same scale as these engineers.

174,dhvi4f3,"I guess my point is that the stigma around Islam exists on both sides of the political spectrum in the states.  If you are a pious, conservative (not in the political sense) Muslim, you are seen different than if you were a pious Catholic, Lutheran, or Jew.  Like the orthodoxy of Islam is somehow much more worse or dangerous than other abrahamic or eastern faiths.  It doesn't help when you have people like Sam Harris/Bill Maher and other popular leftists + all right wing folks going around literally saying ""yeah, but Islam is just *different.* If Muslims really followed their religion to the T, *that bad stuff* would happen.  

But again, I blame it on ignorance and lack of education.  I don't think the majority of non-muslim Americans are truly xenophobic at all, that's not where I was going with this."
175,dhcesat,"Okay, now that’s out of the way, time to address what you’ve thrown in front of me.

&gt;What is stopping subtle racial or socioeconomic discrimination? Because legal action is so costly and timely, it doesn't begin to be a realistic approach for about anyone who does not have a great deal of money. About two years ago, I got fired when it came to light I was out at my job due to some comments about my personal life I made to my coworker. I live in a right-to-work state so they don't have to offer any reason for my firing. I filed a report with the local LGBTQ Equality center, who tells me this is a common practice for this local company, but there is nothing I can do about it because of how strenuous legal action would be---with little chance of success.

Well, once again, you have my sympathy. 

Admittedly, it is difficult to change attitudes to issues like LGBT rights, but what you’re asking of me is a singular solution that does not exist – issues like racial and socioeconomic discrimination are nuanced and complex in the extreme. If anything, escaping victimology seems like the most viable way forward for minority groups. Oftentimes, these people portray themselves as victims of society, helpless to save themselves, in the process demanding the world change by pushing unreasonable demands such as increasingly imbalanced diversity quotas.

Simply powering through the odds using internal support structures and networks might work – a good example of this is women’s involvement in industry during WW2 becoming a significant factor not only in the increasing emancipation of women, but also in securing their right to vote. It proves that the group in concern is more than just a bunch of whining children.

&gt;But that's a gross misunderstanding and simplification---I addressed and refuted your sources, which were fundamentally flawed and acknowledged by many other journalists as being flawed and misleading.

You did not refute my sources, because what you cited either supported my viewpoint or was insubstantial.

&gt;TL;DR (which by the way, is massively insulting and something I never did to you): pay gaps are a mixture of paleo-sexism, unconscious sexism, and double standards.

Like I said, I was short on time. You chose to interpret it as me brushing away your opinion, whereas it was really just a quick summarisation because 1. my phone is shit and was lagging with the long comments and 2. I do have other things to do.

Once again, proving stereotypes wrong is far, far more effective than campaigning about them without adjusting your own behaviour otherwise. Also, you are suggesting that a 24% reduction in labour costs is worth less than working with only men, which is absurd given the huge numbers that especially large companies deal with – within the EU-28, [labour costs on average accounted for 23.9% of business expenditure]( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Wages_and_labour_costs#Labour_costs). This works out to a roughly 6% decrease in budget, which is ridiculous when these institutions are dealing with millions of dollars; to put that in perspective, a typical healthy operating profit margin is ~25%.

The monetary incentive far, far outweighs the social one.

&gt;But you are aware that SJW is a term used by the right to describe anybody who is socially leftist, yes?

SJW is the term used to describe someone who is part of the social justice movement. You can be socially left without identifying with values typically seen in social justice culture.

&gt;Then you should be aware of multiple things, the first being that casual malingering is pretty damn rare.

Sure. But the effect it has thanks to the vocal individuals who engage in this behaviour is certainly anything but insignificant.

Because it is drilled into your head that anybody could be ‘triggered’ by your use of language, you end up with ridiculous concepts such as jazz hands/snapping fingers, removal of material from college courses that could potentially be ‘triggering’ (especially literature), language policing on an unimaginable scale, [you get the gist]( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/05/trigger-warnings-can-be-counterproductive). The problem I have is that people who pull this stuff have an irresistible urge to change the world around them, and they often succeed, often to the detriment of people simply trying to get on with life.

&gt;Really? Because Trump's victory terrifies me, when it's acknowledged that he's endorsed by actual Neo Nazis and David Duke (and refuses to denounce them) and that he assaults women but that doesn't stop people from voting for him? That terrifies me and emboldens violence against people like me (speaking from experience. People's antisemitism and misogyny has become much more open since he's won).

Well, first of all, the sexual harassment thing is a quote that’s been taken out of context. If people actually bothered to take a look, he says something akin to, “you can do anything with that much money… you could go up to women and grab them by the pussy”. It’s a declaration of his own power, not an admission that he sexually harasses women.

Anyway, Founding Fathers and separation of powers 101: the President’s power is severely limited. People are all fucking terrified of him when in reality, he can’t pull off all the stuff that he intends to, because American government is separated into three branches that perform checks and balances on each other. While how effective this system is in regulating presidential power is debatable, I’d recommend reading up on it more.

Furthermore, instead of providing a stable and reasonable counter-argument to supporters of Mr. Wall-builder, the left insisted on ostracizing Trump supporters, calling them bigots and racists, beating them in the streets, attempting to disrupt their rallies – doing this only solidifies their beliefs. I should be worried, but it’s kinda cancelled out by the fact that the left was asking for this to happen.

&gt;Where on earth is your evidence for this?

[Couldn’t link it because my phone is shit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv8H7_K9qtM)

&gt;Additionally, my point was that your first article, WHICH YOU LINKED AND INSINUATED AGREEMENT was about how Arabic women are all oppressed, and then followed it with a link from an actual Arabic women telling people who aren't Arabic women to not talk about this.

&gt;DO YOU SEE YOUR OWN HYPOCRISY?

The article I linked is written by the CEO of Arab Council Australia. As she writes it, she shows little, if any, regard for what’s actually going on in the Middle East. She says this, quoting it as an example of ‘absolute rhetoric’ by extension implying it has no validity: “Arab or Muslim women are oppressed and subservient to men. Or that Arab and Muslim girls are forced into early marriages.”

This is not the case.  The Middle East experiences [startlingly high levels of rape and sexual violence]( http://www.themedialine.org/featured/rates-rape-sexual-violence-high-middle-east/) with IPV being as high as 40%, and [early marriage](http://www.girlsnotbrides.org/region/middle-east-and-north-africa/) is also disgustingly prevalent.

My point was that these individuals stigmatize dialogue that would be genuinely useful – and here is a privileged woman in the West doing exactly that. By attempting to separate the association between poor women’s rights and the Middle East, she is actively hurting women’s rights activism in those areas.

This is not hypocrisy; this is you failing to understand my point.

&gt;So you admit that you are only for your own confirmation bias, because as I said, Lacee Green isn't associated with the left, but with American libertarians (right, center-right).

&gt;Also, your discussion of ""real victims"" is ironic since it sounds exactly like Lacee Green as well as Republicans who doubt rape victims and say shit like ""legitimate rape.""

I fail to see how this has any association to political orientation. Laci Green remains one of the most subscribed to SJWs on the Internet iirc, and just because she doesn’t necessarily get associated with the left doesn’t mean that she isn’t an SJW, and it doesn’t mean that SJWs don’t listen to her intently and agree with her.

And that is an incredibly inaccurate generalisation to make. 

Almost dangerous.

I am in full support of those who experience significant trauma, and condemn those who attempt to imitate victims in an attempt to earn social brownie points and to forward their own agendas. Laci supports victims that endorse her political agenda, and condemns those who don’t.

One of these is reasonable, and the other is an obnoxious mask of deceit and lack of empathy.

Don’t confuse the two.

In this response, you have decided to be personal and invidious without enough support to back it up, so I think you need to reconsider your approach. You failed to properly read almost everything you sent me as ‘evidence’, you failed to properly read any of my arguments, and you proceeded to engage in highly charged outbursts that were not conducive to discussion.

If you’re going to be impolite in a discussion, at the very least, make sure you’re flawless in your execution.

Plus what about millions of hindus converted and murdered in 1947  where is data about that ?  

#YOUR favorite source wikipedia

This is how well Pakistan has treated Hindus but you would rather praise rapists of your ancestors than having spine 

victims of kidnapping and forced conversion to Islam.[226] A member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan claimed in 2010, though without official record, that around 20 to 25 girls from the Hindu community, along with people from other minorities like Christians, are abducted every month and forcibly converted.[227] Many Hindus are continuing to flee Pakistan even now due to persecution.[228] Krishan Bheel, a Hindu member of the National Assembly of Pakistan, came into the news recently for manhandling Qari Gul Rehman after being taunted with a religious insult.[229]

On 18 October 2005, Sanno Amra and Champa, a Hindu couple residing in the Punjab Colony, Karachi, Sindh returned home to find that their three teenage daughters had disappeared. After inquiries to the local police, the couple discovered that their daughters had been taken to a local madrassah, had been converted to Islam, and were denied unsupervised contact with their parents.[230] In January 2017, a Hindu temple was demolished in Pakistan's Haripur district.[231]

A Pakistan Muslim League politician has stated that abduction of Hindus and Sikhs is a business in Pakistan, along with conversions of Hindus to Islam.[232] Forced conversion, rape, and forced marriages of Hindu women in Pakistan have recently become very controversial in Pakistan.[233][234]

In 2006, a Hindu temple in Lahore was destroyed to pave the way for construction of a multi-storied commercial building. When reporters from Pakistan-based newspaper Dawn tried to cover the incident, they were accosted by the henchmen of the property developer, who denied that a Hindu temple existed at the site.[235] In January 2014, a policeman standing guard outside a Hindu temple at Peshawar was gunned down.[236] 25 March 2014 Express Tribune citing an All Pakistan Hindu Rights Movement (PHRM) survey said that 95% of all Hindu temples in Pakistan have been converted since 1990.[237] Pakistanis attack Hindu temples if anything happens to any mosque in neighbouring India.[171] In 2019, a Hindu temple Pakistan's southern Sindh province was vandalism by miscreants and they set fire to holy books and idols inside the temple.[238]

Although Hindus were frequently soft targets in Pakistan,[239][240] the rise of Taliban forces in the political arena has particularly unsettled the already fragile situation for the minority community. Increasing persecution, ostracism from locals and lack of a social support system is forcing more and more Hindus to flee to India.[241][242] This has been observed in the past whenever the conflicts between the two nations escalated,[243] but this has been a notable trend in view of the fact the recent developments are due to internal factors almost exclusively. The Taliban have used false methods of luring, as well as the co-operation of zealots within local authorities to perpetrate religious cleansing.[244]

In July 2010, around 60 members of the minority Hindu community in Karachi were attacked and evicted from their homes following an incident of a Hindu youth drinking water from a tap near an Islamic mosque.[245][246] In January 2014, a policeman standing guard outside a Hindu temple at Peshawar was gunned down.[236] Pakistan's Supreme Court has sought a report from the government on its efforts to ensure access for the minority Hindu community to temples - the Karachi bench of the apex court was hearing applications against the alleged denial of access to the members of the minority community.[247][248][249]

In 2005, 32 Hindus were killed by firing from the government side near Nawab Akbar Bugti's residence during bloody clashes between Bugti tribesmen and paramilitary forces in Balochistan. The firing left the Hindu residential locality near Bugti's residence badly hit.[250]

The rise of Taliban insurgency in Pakistan has been an influential and increasing factor in the persecution of and discrimination against religious minorities in Pakistan, such as Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, and other minorities. Hindu minorities living under the influence of the Taliban in Swat, Pakistan, were forced to wear red headgear such as turbans as a symbol of dhimmi.[241] In July 2010, around 60 members of the minority Hindus in Karachi were attacked and ethnically cleansed following an incident when a Hindu youth drank from a water tap near an Islamic mosque.[245][246] In January 2014, in an attack on a temple, the guard was gunned down.[236]

Some Hindus in Pakistan feel that they are treated as second-class citizens and many have continued to migrate to India.[239][251] According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan data, just around 1,000 Hindu families fled to India in 2013.[252] In May 2014, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, revealed in the National Assembly of Pakistan that around 5,000 Hindus are migrating from Pakistan to India every year.[253]

Many Hindu girls living in Pakistan are kidnapped, forcibly converted and married to Muslims.[254] According to the Pakistan Hindu Council, religious persecution especially forced conversions remain the foremost reason for migration of Hindus from Pakistan. Religious institutions like Bharchundi Sharif and Sarhandi Pir support forced conversions and are known to have support and protection of ruling political parties of Sindh.[255] According to the National Commission of Justice and Peace and the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC) around 1000 Christian and Hindu minority women are converted to Islam and then forcibly married off to their abductors or rapists. This practice is being reported increasingly in the districts of Tharparkar, Umerkot and Mirpur Khas in Sindh.[255] According to another report from the Movement for Solidarity and Peace, about 1,000 non-Muslim girls are converted to Islam each year in Pakistan.[256] According to the Amarnath Motumal, the vice chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, every month, an estimated 20 or more Hindu girls are abducted and converted, although exact figures are impossible to gather.[254] In 2014 alone, 265 legal cases of forced conversion were reported mostly involving Hindu girls.[257]

In 2010 also, 57 Hindus were forced to convert by their employer as his sales dropped after Muslims started boycotting his eatable items as they were prepared by Hindus. Since the impoverished Hindus had no other way to earn and needed to keep the job to survive, hence they converted.[258]

Many Hindus voluntarily converts to Islam for easily getting Watan Cards and National Identification Cards. These converts were also given land and money. For example, 428 poor Hindus in Matli were converted between 2009-11 by the Madrassa Baitul Islam, a Deobandi seminary in Matli, which pays off the debts of Hindus converting to Islam.[259] Another example is the conversion of 250 Hindus to Islam in Chohar Jamali area in Thatta.[258] Conversions are also carried out by Deen Mohammad Shaikh mission which converted 108,000 people to Islam since 1989.[260]

In September 2019,Hindu teacher was attacked and three Hindu temples were vandalised in Ghotki over blasphemy accusations.[261]"

They are the worst of all creatures.""*** The moderate Muslim [believes in this passively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxA9i7zFGKA&amp;t=5m37s).

182,ektjhly,"&gt;	But you DO agree that Muslim Americans are, and have been facing a tremendous amount of Animus after 9/11?

Are there lives more difficult because of unfair presumption, stereotyping, and xenophobia? To some extent, sure. I don’t think the country could go through kind of attack we experienced without something like that naturally rising. I’m not excusing it, or justifying it, but it’s a natural reaction to a pretty horrific event that seem to be guided by an extremist ideology. 

Let’s also not forget that in the days following that attack, pretty much everyone in national politics, indeed across the world, made very clear statements that we should not judge the entire Muslim population against the actions of these crazy people. George W. Bush said precisely that in his first address to the nation days after the attack. In fact, that was one of the few things that people on both sides of the political aisle actually lauded him for. 

You keep talking about a race war as if this is something that every single person whose political compass rests slightly east of Bernie Sanders is itching for. Can you please acknowledge that that’s just absurd? I’m a conservative. I have no interest in a race war, I have no hatred or fear or anger toward either Muslims, minorities, or foreigners in general. I do believe that we have the right as a sovereign nation to dictate and control our borders, and that we need to follow the rule of law when it comes to who we let in, how we let them in, and how many we let in.

I suppose we will have to agree to disagree about her glibness regarding this topic. I just find it rather funny That this woman has said multiple anti-somatic statements in the past, it’s pretty fast and loose with calling people white supremacists and other incendiary terms, but she gets a pass because… She’s on your side? Don’t you think it’s a little fucked up?"
183,eegukpg,"Muslim Americans are more progressive than evangelicals. Republicans frequently attack muslims in the media, there was a recent attempt in Texas to kick out a muslim republican from a political organization on the basis that he was muslim. That's how I'd explain it."
184,e5lo0ml,"It's not *always* Muslims, but there are reasons why its Muslims such a disproportionately frequent amount of times. The reason is Islam.

Firstly, Islam condones the rape of children. Muhammed is considered to be the perfect man, whose actions are an eternal model for Muslims to base their life upon. It is forbidden in Islam to criticise or disagree with the actions of Muhammed in any way, the punishment for this has always been death. Muhammed raped children. The prevalence of child marriages in Muslim majority countries is directly linked to this. Of course, this doesn't mean *all* Muslims are child rapists, just that it is reasonable to expect a higher incidence of child rape among Muslims because there is an easy moral get-out-of-jail-free card they can play. The gangs of racist Muslim rapists are almost always community based, brothers, fathers, grandfathers, cousins, family friends. When one of them brings up the topic of raping children, you would expect at least one member of their family/community group to strongly object on the moral grounds that raping children is wrong, however for Muslims the argument can always be made: ""That's just western bullshit bro, they always want to attack us and our prophet, they say the things the prophet did was wrong cos they're all racist bro"". There is also a Quranic law stating that Muslim men may rape the women of other nations they have enslaved, ""those whom your right hand possesses"", and hadithes where Muhammed helps inspire his generals to fight by boasting of the joy to be had in raping ""the blonde haired, blue eyed women of Byzantium"". 

Secondly, out of all religions Islam is the most hostile to non believers and intolerant of other beliefs. Anyone who has read the Quran will be able to tell you just how much of that book is *obsessed* with ""infidels"". And I truly mean *obsessed*. The Quran encourages racism against non Muslims on almost every single page, tribalism and hatred of outsiders are naturally baked in to most religions, but in Islam this bigotry is made explicit. The lack of religious and cultural freedom in Muslim majority countries is directly linked to these ideas. A great example is what happened to Ahok, a non-Muslim man who was legally elected to become mayor of Jakarta. Just like London has a Muslim mayor, Jakarta was to have a non-Muslim mayor. However, Quran verse 5:22 clearly states that Muslims should not follow non Muslim leaders, that they should not take nob Muslim friends and a whole host of other KKK-tier racist shit. The 5:22 movement sprang up to violently oppose Ahok's election. Many Western apologists spoke up in Ahok's defence (actually in the Quran's defense) they said that verse 5:22 had been misinterpreted, there was context to consider and translation errors, and really verse 5:22 actually means *the exact opposite* of what it explicitly states. Ahok echoed the sentiments of the western apologists and was subsequently charged with blasphemy, found guilty by Indonesia's supreme Court and sent to jail - because how dare he suggest that the Quran encourages pluralism, tolerance and ecumenicism? 

I would say the third main reason is the misogynistic view muslim men like to have of Muslim women, that they are modest, ""pure"", virginal and not sullied and filthy like the sexually liberated western women and girls. The misogynistic metaphor that seems to be quite popular is that non Muslim girls are like unwrapped lollipops, sticky and covered in flies and dirt. 

So, to sum up, I'd put it down to three different things: Islamically permitted child rape, Quranically mandated hatred of non Muslims and Islamic hatred of women.

EDIT I remembered the surah:ayat wrong. It was actually Quran 5:51, not 5:22 as I had stated.

https://quran.com/5/51

O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people."

It's possible that the local Muslim guy at the kebab shop is nice to customers. He's a human being who smiles, serves food, and pays his taxes. There's nothing wrong with these things, but the underlying problem is Islam on a religious, political, and historical level. In Quran 98:6, ***""Unbelievers from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and polytheists will live in the [fire of hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxA9i7zFGKA&amp;t=5m37s). They are the worst of all creatures.""*** In Quran 3:28, ***""Muslim brothers must not put an unbeliever above other Muslims. Whoever does that will never be helped by Allah...""*** Muslims are commanded to favor their own kind in business or politics. At the end of the day, the ""[nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A76DLK20L4o&amp;t=4s)"" Muslim guy will obey his mosque and place his own family and other [Muslims over you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RScj18u_QCM).

187,dyxosqq,"######How to debate a liberal:

(**1**) Islam is not a race. There are [Chinese](http://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/03/13/87fffe94-bc18-11e6-b1a9-d0a597083a8f_660x385.JPG) Muslims in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. There are [white](http://moroccoenglish.com/2013/07/26/norwegian-family-converted-to-islam-after-being-influenced-by-listening-to-quran) Muslims in Europe. There are [black](http://8482-presscdn-0-13.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ISLAM-NOT-RACIST-MEME.jpg) Muslims in Somalia. The liberal wants to call you a ""racist,"" but Muslims are not just of the Arabic race.

&amp;nbsp;

(**2**) Islam is not a religion of unconditional peace. In Quran 60:8, ***""Allah does not stop you from acting kind to unbelievers who won't put up a fight over Islam and will leave you alone in your homes.""*** It sounds good if they're going to be ""kind"" to us, right? But notice how peace is allowed with only the quiet ones. In Quran 4:148, ***""Allah does not like the public mention of evil"".*** This is a hate speech law. You're not given the freedom of speech to criticize Islam in a religious debate. You're [not allowed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/16/pakistan-man-sentenced-to-death-for-ridiculing-prophet-muhammad-on-whatsapp) to draw a cartoon of Muhammad. In Quran 9:29, ***""Fight those who do not believe in Allah... until they give the jizya willingly while they are humbled.""*** Unbelievers can have peace as long as they pay a tax called ""jizya."" Every mention of ""peace"" in the Quran is tied to certain [terms and conditions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkOPHu1w73Q&amp;t=44s) that ensure Islam is the dominant force.

&amp;nbsp;

(**3**) The liberal wants to defend the poor, innocent refugee against the big, bad bully (conservatives). Yes, we criticize the ideology, but we are not necessarily against the individual. It's possible that the local Muslim guy at the kebab shop is nice to customers. He's a human being who smiles, serves food, and pays his taxes. There's nothing wrong with these things, but the underlying problem is Islam on a religious, political, and historical level. In Quran 3:32, ***""...Allah does not like the unbelievers.""*** In Quran 98:6, ***""Unbelievers from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and polytheists will live in the fire of hell. They are the worst of all creatures.""*** In Quran 3:28, ***""Muslim brothers must not put an unbeliever above other Muslims.

188,dwb54x8,"&gt;As could be expected Silja‘s argument has proven to be quite controversial. Jewish and Muslim leaders have criticized the bill, calling it an attack on religious freedom pointing out the fact that Jewish and Muslim boys are often circumcised. And The President of the Commission of the Bishops’ Conferences of the European Community has condemned it on the same grounds.

Religious freedom means being allowed to worship whatever god you want. It doesn't give you the permission to do anything you want as long as your religion says it's okay. Circumcision is genital mutilation, no more, no less."
189,dvnbs6k,"I think I answered most of this in my other reply to you, but just a few things;

&gt; It was one of a kind; the USA is not exactly easy to attack, 

The US is ridiculously easy to attack. In fact, ""they"" don't even have to send people here to do it. Easier to radicalize people who are already here. There have been several terror plots broken up here by Homeland Security and the FBI (and the next time someone talk about ""Muslim jihadists in America"", point out that most of those wins come as a result of tips from American Muslims). We just don't hear about them. I think the reason we haven't had more attacks here is because of a combination of factors. One, we have cut off much of their support by making the Taliban fight us there. Two, the stepped up security here. Three, most of the radicalized concerts here went to Syria to fight for DAESH. And four, Muslim Americans are *Americans*. When they get wind of a plot, they blow it in"
190,dtzorbl,"&gt;Marx, who is a close counsellor of Pope Benedict calls the bill an attack on religious freedom pointing to the fact that Jewish and Muslim boys are often circumcised. 

Bíddu, eru múslimastúlkur ekki oft umskornar líka? Hvort ætli herra Marx telji það einnig vera árás gegn trúfrelsi?"
191,dr0rn2y,"&gt;Again... Source? I did a one minute search on this and found the opposite, and Evangelical Christians in the US are the most anti-homosexuals (36% in favor).

Exact opposite of what? That Islam is more accepting of homosexuality overall? Or that *Muslim Americans* support homosexuality (btw, that is to say only about half)?

&gt;Non-Christians highly support homosexuality, with ""shares of religiously unaffiliated people (83%) and members of non-Christian faiths (76%)"" [2].

Reason number one why we should abolish religion.

&gt;Muslim Americans are slightly in favor of homosexuality acceptance in society. ""And about half of U.S. Muslims (52%) now say homosexuality should be accepted by society"" [1].

Again, only half of Muslims support homosexuality. Tell me again that Islam is a better religion and more accepting? Not convinced that Islam is a problem? Read on.

&gt;Evangelical Christians are completely opposed to homosexuality. ""Most Mormons and evangelical Protestants still say homosexuality should be discouraged by society – in line with the teachings of many of their churches – but 36% of both groups say it should be accepted."" [2]

Reason number two why we should abolish religion.

_______________________________

I'm saying that Islam is a bad religion and does not deserve respect for the following reasons:

a) Muslims in Islamic countries view westerners [as such](http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2011/07/2011-Muslim-West-16.png)

I don't think I like how they view us. Maybe it's why they attack us all the time. Ever think of that?

b) The support for Sharia law in Muslim countries is [overwhelming](http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/04/gsi2-overview-1.png)

Sharia law, if you don't know, is quite oppressive in nature.

c) Some of the populations of Muslim countries [support the actions of ISIS](http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/11/FT_15.11.17_isis_views.png)

Let's analyze this, shall we? (parentheses denote potential radicals, excluding first number)

Radicals in Israel: 85,470 (170,940) / 8,547,000

Radicals in Jordan: 283,680 (378,240) / 9,456,000

Radicals in Palestinian territories: 273,000 (455,000) / 4,550,000

Radicals in Indonesia: 10,444,000 (46,998,000) / 261,100,000

Radicals in Turkey: 6,360,800 (15,106,900) / 79,510,000

Radicals in Nigeria: 26,040,000 (37,200,000) / 186,000,000

Radicals in Burkina Faso: 1,492,000 (5,222,000) / 18,650,000

Radicals in Malaysia: 3,430,900 (7,797,500) / 31,190,000

Radicals in Senegal: 1,695,100 (3,852,500) / 15,410,000

Radicals in Pakistan: 17,388,000 (119,784,000) / 193,200,000

Total radicals / total Muslims: 67,492,950 / 807,613,000 = 8.36%

Total potential radicals / total Muslims: (67,492,950 + 236,965,080) / 807,613,000 = 37.70%

This is only taking into account support for ISIS. Do you want me to do support for Sharia law? This took me at max 10 minutes.

How many Christian terror groups can you name off the top of your head? I have 3 Islamic terror groups. Now 4. They keep coming to me by the second.

If you don't have yourself a copy of the Qu'ran, [here's the link]https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/homosexuality.aspx) to a website with accurate citations on the matter of homosexuality. There are several in the Bible, too. Again, why religion should be abolished as a whole. But how many Christians actively throw gays off of roofs or burn gay villages."
192,djylz7d,"Well, I do think that Muslim girls should take off their hijab. And I even think that many (but not all) Muslim girls are forced to wear hijab. But note that I don't attack hijabi girls, nor do I advocate or condone attacking them.

&gt; some ex-Muslims think this way.

So what? Still no double standard."
193,djymw7q,"Why are you pretending like I asked about your opinion? If this is how you think, great. 
But I hate to break it to you, but not all ex-Muslims think like you.

There are some ex-Muslims (mostly women) who believe Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab, despite Muslim women stating themselves that they love wearing the hijab.

Some ex-Muslims (again mostly women) who think emotionally who are still in the state of mind where they think the hijab represent nothing but oppression. That is understable considering they were probably forced to wear the hijab, but what they fail to understand is that not all Muslim women were forced to wear the hijab. 

&gt; never said that. or implied that. why do you straw man? is it because of your logic?

Then please explain what you meant by this: 

'You should wear the hijab in the west, because there are sexually hungry men who can attack you for not wearing the hijab''
(wtf)

Are you actually implying that Muslim women wear the hijab to only cover themselves from ''sexually hungry men'' If you think Muslim women wear the hijab solely for this reason, then I think you need to educate yourself about the hijab.


&gt; Then they should get that.

It's not as easy as it sounds, especially when ex-Muslims defend the digusting acts of islamophobic people. There's a differene between Muslim girls who are being forced to wear the hijab, and Muslims girl who love to wear the hijab. But it seems as though some ex-Muslims don't know the differene (mostly ex-Muslim women).


&gt; No we don't. stop presuming.

I think you meant assuming. Anyway, no one is assuming. Obivously not all ex.Muslims claim Muslim girls are lying, but some do to further their ex-Muslims agenda. 


&gt; The only people who don't take is seriously are emotionally charged, sentimental cowards who can't face intellectual reason. Those who deny death. Those who are so greedy and eager to keep on living they are wasting the only life they get.

Well you have to udnerstand one thing: just because you think Islam is evil, oppressive, and violent, not everyone thinks the same way, including westerns and the rest of the world.

Some ex-Muslims fail to understand this. You actually proved my point by calling those who don't agree with your views ''sentimental cowards who can't face intellectual reason''. You are being hostile against atheists and westerners because you thought they automatically agreed with your anti-Islamic views because they don't agree with Islam.

194,di4tcj1,"Because ideas have power. Trump has created a narrative where the idea that Muslim Americans are the enemy is not only something believe, but something believed by and endorsed by the highest level of the government. Now if you're some psychopathic dipshit who hates Muslims, or a particular Muslim, or non whites, people in general or if you see someone who appears Muslim who has something you want you can attack them and feel like a hero. 

That's what you very when you spew ignorance and hatred all day. You tell the ignorant and hateful that they're right. That what they want to do isn't immoraland detestable, but heroic. When you're the fucking President shitheads listen.

Incidentally, this is exactly the same thing ISIS is doing. Making killing people something heroic rather than monstrous."
195,dhm2guc,"maybe it's also because muslim-americans are allowed to wear hijabs, burkas, and stuff. in france they have a ban on religious symbols and muslims aren't allowed to wear hijabs in public places. so some muslims there view it as an attack on their identity "
196,dhvo0go,"&gt;EXACTLY! Which is why it was his parents that are at fault for bringing their dead son into it. He had no say and that is an outrageous thing to do to one's own child let alone a decorated veteran.

Trump was attacking Muslims and his base was frothing at the mouth with their blind hatred of all things Muslim. The DNC, to counter that, brought the Khans on to show everyone that Muslim Americans are as patriotic as any other American and have even given their life in service to the country. Is this wrong? Was Captain Khan supposed to rise from the dead and make the case himself? 

I mean, the republicans brought out the mother of the soldier who died in Benghazi to speak at the RNC. How is that any different? Did any democrat or liberal attack her as viciously as Roger Stone attacked the Khans? I am starting to think that you too share the belief that Captain Khan was a sympathiser. It is one thing to say 'Hey don't bring up your son to attack Trump' but it is reprehensible to accuse a man who died in service of being a sympathiser just because he was Muslim. That is grossly unfair and morally wrong. 

&gt;No, we just don't allow your faux patriotism to be used against us. Why don't you go burn some more American flags and pal around with Black Lives Matter and then get back to me about how patriotic the left is.

We are not the ones who shamelessly denigrated a veteran and his family. Is BLM part of the military now? What do they have to do with patriotism and supporting the troops? Ah the American flag. It will adorn your vehicles, clothes and mugs but that will not stop you siding with the man who shat on the memory of a purple heart veteran because his family didn't kiss Trump's feet. 

&gt;I think it's a real shame that Trump has Ivanka in the white house and not Eric or Don Jr.

Wouldn't it still be nepotism if Eric or Don Jr were as involved in the Trump administration as Ivanka currently is? Since you don't seem to have a problem with nepotism per se, is your objection to Ivanka because she is married to a ~~Jew~~ globalist? 

&gt;Lobbyists are gnats. Drain the swamp of corrupt politicians and the lobbyists have no power. I don't care if this is at odds with Trump's definition or not.

As I suspected. Trump is merely a figurehead for all of you to project your insecurities and desires onto. It doesn't really matter what he says or does as long as you can proudly exclaim 'Libtards BTFO' and 'Fuck globalist scum!'. "
197,dhvoohm,"&gt;Trump was attacking Muslims

Sorry, I think you have this one wrong. Muslims have been attacking the West.

&gt;and his base was frothing at the mouth with their blind hatred of all things Muslim.

Blind hatred? Seems harsh. Most of us just want them to go back to the Middle East and leave us in peace.

&gt;The DNC, to counter that, brought the Khans on to show everyone that Muslim Americans are as patriotic as any other American and have even given their life in service to the country. Is this wrong? Was Captain Khan supposed to rise from the dead and make the case himself?

Actually, yes that is wrong. One example is an outlier not the norm. What percentage of Muslim Americans join the armed forces? [ABC news](http://abcnews.go.com/US/5000-muslims-serving-us-military-pentagon/story?id=35654904) tells me a little less than 6,000 Muslims are in the military. [Pew Research](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/01/06/a-new-estimate-of-the-u-s-muslim-population/?utm_source=Pew+Research+Center&amp;utm_campaign=65c3bb5fd7-Religion_Weekly_Jan_7_2016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_3e953b9b70-65c3bb5fd7-400104481) tells me there are 3.3 million Muslims living in the United States. I've always been shit at math so I'll let you figure out the percentage if you want but I can tell it isn't very high. So if we're going to equate military service to patriotism the Muslim community in the United States as a whole is not really very patriotic. One honorable deceased vet does not change that.

&gt;I mean, the republicans brought out the mother of the soldier who died in Benghazi to speak at the RNC. How is that any different? 

Hillary Clinton called her a liar prior to the Convention. Also, as you know, Benghazi was going to be an issue in the campaign. It was relevant. The parents of a random Muslim vet who was dead was not relevant to Trump. It had no bearing on his ability to do his job or his integrity. The same could not be said of Hillary Clinton in the reverse situation.

&gt;Did any democrat or liberal attack her as viciously as Roger Stone attacked the Khans?

[Does wanting to beat her to death count?](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/07/liberal-writer-gq-magazine-pat-smith-like-beat-death/)

&gt; I am starting to think that you too share the belief that Captain Khan was a sympathiser. It is one thing to say 'Hey don't bring up your son to attack Trump' but it is reprehensible to accuse a man who died in service of being a sympathiser just because he was Muslim. That is grossly unfair and morally wrong.

I don't doubt Khan's loyalty to America. I do have doubts about his parents however.

&gt;We are not the ones who shamelessly denigrated a veteran and his family.

No, you're just the ones who make light of things like Fort Hood, Orlando, San Bernadino, etc and claim there isn't a problem while people die. I'm glad you have such moral integrity not to denigrate someone though.

&gt;Is BLM part of the military now? What do they have to do with patriotism and supporting the troops?

Law enforcement deserves the same respect and it is just as unpatriotic to attack them for doing their job as it is to attack the troops for doing theirs.

&gt;Ah the American flag. It will adorn your vehicles, clothes and mugs but that will not stop you siding with the man who shat on the memory of a purple heart veteran because his family didn't kiss Trump's feet.

I never asked him to kiss Trump's feet. Making a coherent argument is something I would appreciate though. All I ever heard from Khan was REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE and pathetic appeals to the Constitution while Americans have legitimate reason to reconsider Muslim immigration.

&gt;Wouldn't it still be nepotism if Eric or Don Jr were as involved in the Trump administration as Ivanka currently is? Since you don't seem to have a problem with nepotism per se, is your objection to Ivanka because she is married to a Jew globalist?

My objection to Ivanka is primarily her views in immigration and her influence with her father. Don Jr and Eric clearly don't have the same pull with their father as well as holding different views than Ivanka.

&gt;As I suspected. Trump is merely a figurehead for all of you to project your insecurities and desires onto. It doesn't really matter what he says or does as long as you can proudly exclaim 'Libtards BTFO' and 'Fuck globalist scum!'.

And Muslim-Americans are not widespread or visible enough for most people to have that dispelling effect of ""nah I know some, they're good people"".

""Hey at least Xtians have advanced past these _downright medieval_ dumb dumbs!"""
202,fi0n0so,"**Short Answer** : *forced conversions*

**Long answer** : 


**INDIA**

In an invasion of the Kashmir valley (1015), Mahmud of Ghazni plundered the valley, took many prisoners and carried out conversions to Islam.In his later campaigns, in Mathura, Baran and Kanauj, again, many conversions took place. Those soldiers who surrendered to him were converted to Islam. In Baran (Bulandshahr) alone 10,000 persons were converted to Islam including the king. Tarikh-i-Yamini, Rausat-us-Safa and Tarikh-i-Ferishtah speak of construction of mosques and schools and appointment of preachers and teachers by Mahmud and his successor Masud. Wherever Mahmud went, he insisted on the people to convert to Islam.The raids by Muhammad Ghori and his generals brought in thousands of slaves in the late 12th century, most of whom were compelled to convert as one of the preconditions of their freedom. Sikandar Butshikan (1394-1417) demolished Hindu temples and forcefully converted Hindus. Christianity thrived along the west coast during the 15th and 16th centuries following forced conversions carried out by Portuguese colonists.

Aurangzeb employed a number of means to encourage conversions to Islam. In a Mughal-Sikh war in 1715, 700 followers of Banda Singh Bahadur were beheaded.Every day, 100 Sikhs were executed and not even one of them apostatized from Sikhism.Banda Singh Bahadur was offered a pardon if he converted to Islam. Upon refusal, he was tortured,and was killed with his 5 year old son. Following the execution of Banda, the emperor ordered to apprehend Sikhs anywhere they were found.

18th century ruler Tipu Sultan persecuted the Hindus, Christians and Mappla Muslims. During Sultan's Mysorean invasion of Kerala, hundreds of temples and churches were demolished and ten thousands of Christians and Hindus were killed or converted to Islam by force.


**BANGLADESH** 

In Bangladesh, the International Crimes Tribunal tried and convicted several leaders of the Islamic Razakar militias, as well as Bangladesh Muslim Awami league (Forid Uddin Mausood), of war crimes committed against Hindus during the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. The charges included forced conversion of Bengali Hindus to Islam.

**INDIA** 

In the 1998 Prankote massacre, 26 Kashmiri Hindus were beheaded by Islamist militants after their refusal to convert to Islam. The militants struck when the villagers refused demands from the gunmen to convert to Islam and prove their conversion by eating beef.During the Noakhali riots of Hindus in 1946, several thousand Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam by Muslim mobs.

**PAKISTAN**

The rise of Taliban insurgency in Pakistan has been an influential and increasing factor in the persecution of and discrimination against religious minorities, such as Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, and other minorities.

The Human Rights Council of Pakistan has reported that cases of forced conversion are increasing.[96][97] A 2014 report by the Movement for Solidarity and Peace (MSP) says about 1,000 women in Pakistan are forcibly converted to Islam every year.

In 2003 a six-year-old Sikh girl was kidnapped by a member of the Afridi tribe in Northwest Frontier Province; the alleged kidnapper claimed the girl was actually 12-years-old, and had converted to Islam so therefore could not be returned to her non-Muslim family.

In May 2007, members of the Christian community of Charsadda in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan, close to the border of Afghanistan, reported that they had received letters threatening bombings if they did not convert to Islam, and that the police were not taking their fears seriously. In June 2009, International Christian Concern (ICC) reported the rape and killing of a Christian man in Pakistan, for refusing to convert to Islam.

Rinkle Kumari, a 19-year Pakistani student, Lata Kumari, and Asha Kumari, a Hindu working in a beauty parlor, were allegedly forced to convert from Hinduism to Islam. They told the judge that they wanted to go with their parents. Their cases were appealed all the way to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The appeal was admitted but remained unheard ever after.

Sikhs in Hangu district stated they were being pressured to convert to Islam by Yaqoob Khan, the assistant commissioner of Tall Tehsil, in December 2017. However, the Deputy Commissioner of Hangu Shahid Mehmood denied it occurred and claimed that Sikhs were offended during a conversation with Yaqub though it wasn't intentional.

Many Hindu girls living in Pakistan are kidnapped, forcibly converted and married to Muslims. According to the Pakistan Hindu Council, religious persecution, especially forced conversions, remains the foremost reason for migration of Hindus from Pakistan. Religious institutions like Bharchundi Sharif and Sarhandi Pir support forced conversions and are known to have support and protection of ruling political parties of Sindh. According to the National Commission of Justice and Peace and the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC) around 1000 Christian and Hindu minority women are converted to Islam and then forcibly married off to their abductors or rapists. This practice is being reported increasingly in the districts of Tharparkar, Umerkot and Mirpur Khas in Sindh. According to another report from the Movement for Solidarity and Peace, about 1,000 non-Muslim girls are converted to Islam each year in Pakistan.  According to the Amarnath Motumal, the vice chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, every month, an estimated 20 or more Hindu girls are abducted and converted, although exact figures are impossible to gather. In 2014 alone, 265 legal cases of forced conversion were reported mostly involving Hindu girls. A total of 57 Hindus converted in Pasrur during May 14–19. On May 14, 35 Hindus of the same family were forced to convert by their employer because his sales dropped after Muslims started boycotting his eatable items as they were prepared by Hindus as well as their persecution by the Muslim employees of neighbouring shops according to their relatives. Since the impoverished Hindu had no other way to earn and needed to keep the job to survive, they converted. 14 members of the another family converted on May 17 since no one was employing them, later another Hindu man and his family of eight under pressure from Muslims to avoid their land being grabbed.

In 2017, the Sikh community in Hangu district of Pakistan’s Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province alleged that they were “being forced to convert to Islam” by a government official. Farid Chand Singh, who filed the complaint, has claimed that Assistant Commissioner Tehsil Tall Yaqoob Khan was allegedly forcing Sikhs to convert to Islam and the residents of Doaba area are being tortured religiously.According to reports, about 60 Sikhs of Doaba had demanded security from the administration.

Many Hindus voluntarily convert to Islam for easily getting Watan Cards and National Identification Cards. These converts were also given land and money. For example, 428 poor Hindus in Matli were converted between 2009 and 2011 by the Madrassa Baitul Islam, a Deobandi seminary in Matli, which pays off the debts of Hindus converting to Islam.Another example is the conversion of 250 Hindus to Islam in Chohar Jamali area in Thatta.Conversions are also carried out by Deen Mohammad Shaikh mission which converted 108,000 people to Islam since 1989.

Within Pakistan, the province of the southern Sindh had over 1,000 forced conversions of Christian and Hindu girls according to the annual report of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan in 2018. According to victims’ families and activists, Mian Abdul Haq, who is a local political and religious leader in Sindh, has been accused of being responsible for forced conversions of girls within the province."
203,ffy3xql,"Ah, the classic memes. Did you read the article, or the questions of your misused poll?

&gt; An additional 7% say suicide bombings are sometimes justified and 1% say they are often justified.

A soldier jumps on a grenade to save his comrade. Being the first to charge a hill, knowing your death will aid in your nation’s victory. Kamikazis. There are hundreds of examples in which every culture thinks a noble death is a good thing. But when MUSLIMS do it, oh no watch out. 

The question itself states that, “In times if war, are suicide bombings justified.”

&gt; including 40% in the Palestinian territories, 39% in Afghanistan, 29% in Egypt and 26% in Bangladesh.

Other than Egypt, which has a a lot of social and political rot, all those countries deal with constant war. So when people are being bombed from above the clouds, it makes them angry.

We're the ""worldwide"" part. So, 3% of Muslims in Canada think this is okay to **suicide bomb civilians OFTEN**.

Can you tell me what 3% of 1.5 million people is? That's 45,000 people. **45,000**. That's not widely rejected.

The poll was conducted by Pew research. Another poll shows more American Muslims believe that killing civilians can never be justified then Christians. Seems to me these polls are contradicting everything you say. 

The issue is not a religion, it's the economic status. Obviously, Muslim Americans are more educated and economically stable then Muslims in the Mideast. This is why we don't see 3 and half million Muslims in the U.S killing people every day. However, we do see radical rightwingers going to places of worship and shooting the place up."

&gt;the vast majority of them would be fucking miserable places to live.

Imperialism does ruin lots of places, doesn’t it? 

&gt;The vast majority of muslims do support Sharia Law, Pew did a study on this

No they didn’t. They took a survey across dozens of rural regions across the muslim world. This survey is a huge meme and is misread by bigots all the time. More specific surveys reveal a much different story, like this one, showing Muslim Americans are more “American” In their stances than Christians and even Jews.

“Seems” is the key word here. It “seems” because you actively go look for it. But statistics show very different things, especially considering that the US has bombed more Muslims than Muslims have bombed everyone else. That’s pretty fanatic, right? But you’ll use some double speak to excuse an entire govenrment from doing horrible things to specific groups of people as not fanatic.

Sure this is based off an old TV show but... it's problematic. Sure no one thought it was problematic back when it was *popular* but times change, people change and mature and cultural sensitivity is now more a thing than ever. Think back on all the offensive moments on old movies and TV shows -- if someone decided to pull off the yellowface from *Breakfast at Tiffany's*, wouldn't we be calling that out as problematic?

This is still problematic, and fetishizes a religion and culture in a time period where many people *from that religion and culture* are in danger around the world. Jeanie is said to be from Iraq -- Baghdad, I believe -- a country that is war-torn and still suffering. A country that has *directly suffered* thanks to American Imperialism and pseudo-colonization. As a Muslim woman who *traveled* to Iraq recently, it's something that hits hard every day.

I watched throngs of widowed women and mourning mothers, all dressed in black, clinging to the mausoleums of the martyred descendants of Peygambar Muhammed (PBUH), tying scraps of shirts and veils to the metal screens separating the people from the burial mounds. Those fabric scraps are often *all that's left* of the victims of bombings and drone strikes and attacks.

In this day and age, turning Djinn -- an integral part of Islamic culture and Islamic lore -- into a costume because of an old TV show is *still gross and problematic*. Muslim Americans are at risk of being killed every day, are at risk of having their citizenship status revoked under the administration's new task-force, are not protected by this government. We grow up on the stories of Djinn and Ifrit, even non-Arab Muslims. I still sleep with a Qur'an near my head because it's said to scare the Ifrit away.

Furthermore, just because something *else* is problematic -- TF not being able to foundation match customers -- doesn't mean *this isn't* problematic. People have the right to decide multiple things are problematic or focus on one instead of the other."

wrong.  because if it included internet attacks it would be in the thousands. 

and even if it was using those numbers, there are more jews than muslims in germany. so let capita, id still be correct. 

&gt;You gonna accept that Muslims actually have more in common with those right wing nationalists

except that 95% of bigoted attacks aren't committed by muslims. 

when muslims do something like start the world wars, commit genocide close to anything nationalists have done, or bomb an entire region for several decades, then maybe this claim would have some merit. but history and current events have shown us otherwise. 

&gt;spout propaganda so you can have a pat on the back from other emotional liberals?

oh no, the liberal boogeyman!  

i'm a libertarian, american born muslim who has immigrant parents. i know far more about muslims than you can read on ironically named websites. i majored in the history of islam. i teach immigrants in a dense middle east community in the US. 

also, statistically:

https://niskanencenter.org/blog/muslim-americans-are-more-likely-to-reject-violence-intolerance-than-many-americans/

muslims in the US are more liberal, less anti gay, and less violent than any other religious group. they're the most educated except
for jews.

The US has 27 rapes per 100,000 and Hong Kong has 1.4. So that must mean that Buddhists rape less than Christians. We can't let Christians into our country, or at the least, have to be more wary of them. Is that cultural relativism? I just think it's dubious to make a generalization about one *culture* being more prone to rape or homophobia. Like you said, Muslim Americans are more tolerant than Christian Americans. It has nothing to do with their Christian-ness or Muslim-ness. 

&gt; I have (see the point about American Indian genocide), and you didn't respond.

I did respond to that. I said the Native Americans did fight back and killed a lot of settlers. They just didn't have suicide vests at the time. And I still don't see why that matters really, I tend to agree with Russel Brand here. We fetishize suicide bombings. I guess I just wonder what you think a rational response to genocide should be. If American Indians *had* blown themselves up in crowded saloons or whatever, would you think that they were doing it for political reasons or would you think that it was because of their paganism? 

EDIT: Didn't see your other comment addressing this. "
215,dsa5fhn,"&gt; Is Africa exporting that hateful ideology around the world via state-funded schools that teach that intolerance?

No, and neither is the middle east, except for Saudi Arabia, which is allowed to do so, and encouraged, by the US, who is Saudi Arabia's best ally and biggest enabler.  So what now, when you realize that a secular state that has separation of church and state in it's constitution is selling record amounts of weapons to the biggest exporter of this ideology?

&gt;Africans inflicting mass-casualty events in gay night clubs?

Nope, they just break into the houses of people they think are gay, and they're never seen from again.  but I guess since gay nightclubs are outlawed in these Christian majority states, it's suddenly less bad?  Are you even trying to use your brain?

&gt;Or are you desperately trying to reach a false equivalence to absolve Islam of its place as the primary purveyor of intolerance in the world?

I'm not the one ignoring very basic facts to push a hateful ideology like a massive hypocrite.  ""Hating gays is bad, but it's ok to hate Muslims, because I say they're intolerant!""  

Here, let me provide you some more facts, about how Muslims in America are far more tolerant than any other religious group, and less like to advocate violence than even Jews.

In Germany, ALL Muslim MPs voted in favor of same sex marraige.

Muslims overwhelming vote for democrats in US elections, as well.

so...where are they being hateful?  Where they are being bombed?  where the hateful Muslims are being armed to the teeth with weapons ""Made in America?""

Try again."
216,dt14v5g,"&gt; Radical atheist, that's the first time I heard the phrase.

Because there is no agenda that wants to demonize a faction of atheists to take over their land or resources.  There USED to be, what with things like adding ""Under God"" to lots of things because communists were atheists.  but hey, you can call it whatever you want, as long as you realize they killed more people than anyone else in the name of atheism.

&gt;You used the word 'correlation' and 'causality', but I don't think you understand the word. Let me clear a couple of things here.

I was using the terms ironically to mock your use of the word, but good job letting that go over your head.

&gt;I still don't see what is the correlation in what we are talking about.

because you don't want to see it.  I repeated myself several times at this point.  When Muslims commit terrible acts, no matter how minor, it's Islam.  I'm pointing out that terrible acts, even worse acts, can be committed by anyone, and Islam is irrelevant.  you are insisting schools that teach the Quran are radicalizing.  do you understand yet?

you combining my points into a mish mash doesn't invalidate what I actually said.

&gt;But the very fact remains, ISIS is ISIS because they read the book.

again, only because you know nothing.  ISIS is what ISIS is because of several factors, primarily the, I don't know, 10+ years of bombing and war the US waged against the homeland of ISIS members in the name of oil, angering a bunch of young orphans who grew up only knowing war?  let's not forget the endless supply of arms given to them by our government and it's allies, the drone strikes Obama committed across several states, the deletion of Democracy in places like Egypt...that's just off the top of my head.

but yes, it's just this one book.  Even though where this book is considered divine, ISIS hasn't existed for most of it's history.  But please, ignore the very recent history that every adult should know about and the fact that violence begets violence.

hey, look at this: Muslims in America are more likely to reject violence, and separation of Religion and state even more than Christians or Jews.

https://niskanencenter.org/blog/muslim-americans-are-more-likely-to-reject-violence-intolerance-than-many-americans/

but Muslims in America have the same book.  It's not a different book.  it's the literal exact same one.  

I'm gonna go ahead and be smart and blame those decade-long bombing sprees for radicalization, not a book that says ""God is Great"" often."
217,drazsn2,"&gt; the bad ones would be told to shape up.

what a stupid line of reasoning that doesn't make any sense at all and completely ignores the fact that the Muslim world has been bombed, exploited, and their radicals armed to the teeth by foreign nations.

If someone bombed the US, installed puppet dictators into random states, and armed the alt-right with endless supplies of guns, it would be the exact same.

&gt;However, the ""moderate"" muslims still have disgusting beliefs, so they're not.

YOu don't get to dictate what their beliefs are.  You're just some tool on reddit trying his best to rationalize and spread his hate.  

&gt;I want a world where women and gays are treated equally, and that is not a muslim belief.

Isn't it?  American Muslims tend to agree with these things, at least legally.  Also, there are plenty of Christians who treat women and gays horribly.  Jews as well.  

The difference being the Quran doesn't damn gays directly, nor does it damn gays for having the emotional response of being homosexuals.  The issue was always rooted in the act, which is lumped in with Adultery.  

The Quran even says if they repent, forgive them, and only punish adulterers (and thus, gay adulterers) if there are 5 people to witness their crime.  It's intentionally difficult for such an event to occur.

the line being:

(4:16) Punish both of those among you who are guilty of this sin, then if they repent and mend their ways, leave them alone. For Allah is always ready to accept repentance. He is All-Compassionate.

This is the only line, and it is also translated to say ""punish both men"", because the verses before this line already discuss what to do if women are involved in adultery.

But other than that, there is very little.  There are hadith where the prophet says to punish those who do what Lot's people did, but the story of Lot is about widespread hedonism, which included homosexuality, but was not the main focus of the issues the cities had.  

also, Muslims vote left a majority of the time in the US, and are more ""western"" in the US than CHristians and Jews, according to this:

218,dqbxao4,"I don't think there will be many non Muslim buyers for this Barbie. And I don't know if little Muslim girls are allowed to play with dolls like that, hijab or not. I think this will bomb hugely. "
219,dqeunai,"Obama is out of power.  Obama did help bring tens of thousands of Muslims to the US.  The largest Muslim area in the US is in Dearborn, Michigan.  There are smaller neighborhoods throughout the US.  Sharia is used by many as a private legal way to settle disputes in the US.  In the UK there are many areas that are Islam dominated and have unofficial Sharia patrols.  Young non-Muslim girls are targeted for exploitation in the UK and the police look the other way.  In Sweden the city of Malmo has grenade bombings almost every week, and 80% of the violent rapes are committed by Muslim immigrants who bring their Third World Culture to Sweden.  

There are 57 Muslim countries in the world, and each one is a nightmare in its own unique way.  Most Muslims dream of escaping to non-Muslim countries, but strangely, they want to set up the same failed system of Islam in the new countries.  

Which Western elites are pushing Muslim immigration?  It seems to be all of them.  For what purpose?  They seem to want to divide and conquer the native populations by distracting them with the illogical flamboyant violence Muslims are famous for.  Across Germany on New Years Eve in 2015/2016 women were attacked in ten different cities.  The police and media kept quiet for days as people reported the systematic attacks on the internet.  Who wanted to send a message to the women of Germany that their life of freedom and going out at night was over? "
220,dnovqj1,"Dude the most radical Christian sect in America is the westboro baptist church and the worst they do is picket funerals and sue people.

But I'll humor you show me a study that says over 25% of Non Muslim Americans are open to bombing civilians and I'll concede.

221,dokx3yl,"&gt; Yeah most seem okay with suicide bombing saying it is ""sometimes justifiable""

American Christians believe that it's 'sometimes justifiable' to target civilians too, but don't let that get in the way of your narrative.

222,dolq4c0,"I'm not saying you should hate Muslims, but what you should hate is Islam.

Muhammad was a pedophile, who married one of his wives at 6, the Qur'an says you should treat all Muslims like your brothers, but you should slay the non believers. Only Muslim women are forced to wear hijabs, burqas, niqabs because it's a symbol of ownership. Being gay is punishable by death in Islam, Sharia law doesn't let women drive, Muslim girls are often victims of FGM, they're obsessed with bombing people and Muslim migrants are raping, throwing acid and killing all over Europe. "
223,dm41e5y,"sure, let's.

islam is fluid, and becomes like the culture it's a part of. if that culture is bombed for a century, it becomes violent. "
224,dmqu3tx,"But they are bombing several countries, and many do believe women don't have any rights, i'd say just as much as Muslims who think this.  The difference being they don't have totalitarian control given to them by, and here is where this all gets ironic, Christian countries.

You can claim secular governments comprised of mostly christians isn't christian, but there is a reason they target the Muslim world and have difficulties getting away with attempting to bomb the christian world.  South AMerican drug cartels are full of ""christians"" doing far, far worse than any Islamic radical groups have, and they haven't been bombed.

See the problem here with your false dichotomy?  When I apply YOUR logic to Christians, it ends up being far worse.  Good thing this line of logic is completely wrong, right?  

also, Muslim Americans are less likely to advocate violence than Christian, and even Jewish Americans.  They are also more for separation of church (or in this case, mosque) and state than Christian Americans.

225,digafpm,"&gt; but it's been a blight on the world for some time now.

a blight triggered by european/american imperialism. if being bombed for a couple decades pisses off a bunch of people and drives them to violence, then maybe you should stop bombing them. it's like beating a dog, and when the dog bites back, you blame the dog. 

&gt;The non-centralization is also a huge issue

it's actually the opposite, and don't use mlk to further your political agenda. black on black crime is still extremely violent, and without islam (actually african americans who convert to islam statistically commit less violent crimes). muslims in the us, for example, aren't being manipulated by the saudis, for example. an isis mosque in iraq has no power over a mosque in south africa other than internet posts. 

&gt;a lot of the ideology must destroyed or absolutely reinterpreted.

you are not in a position or knowledgeable enough to make this claim. islam is fluid and has a hue variety of interpretations, schools of thought and law, traditions, ect. islam fits into the culture it's in. muslim communities have been in the us and europe for decades (longer in the us). the us for example, american muslims are less violent than american on muslims.

226,dgvdgdu,I have to admit young Muslim boys are extremely brave when they have a bomb strapped to their chest.  This is bravery I cannot fathom.
227,ftd371b,"Yes. Julie Bindel a radical lesbian feminist (who is extremely based and pinkpilled) was the **first** journalist to write about the Muslim trafficking gangs in her work against prostitution. https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/three-girls-drama-child-sexual-exploitation-rochdale-blackpool-pimping-a7739006.html, https://unherd.com/2018/06/dont-hear-gang-grooming-girls/.


In my experience, the radical feminist opposition to trafficking gangs is the only non-hypocritical one. We oppose the sexual abuse of girls by anyone. Working-class and poverty-class radical feminists in the UK often have had so much first hand experience of how Muslim men and boys treat girls. We also do not deny that ""our"" men and boys are usually fucked up abusers of girls too. We are preyed on by all sides. I have friends and family who have been prostituted and my mother's friend was murdered by a john then the pimps covered it up. Most working-class girls I know were sexually abused before the age of 18. Men are the problem. Men and boys encouraged through their Islamic culture to treat certain girls as easy prey are encouraged to act abusively and show their true male nature. It is important to remember these men sexually abuse their Muslim wives, daughters and sisters horribly too. As do men of all cultures. Culture doesn't cause male violence, it encourages and allows it. If it was purely an Islamic problem, Muslim women would be the same but they are usually lovely even though they were also taught white/non-Muslim girls are idiot sluts. Misogynistic cultures produce worse men on average but there is no safe type of men anywhere because better cultures merely try to train male nature out of them and that usually fails. I say male nature rather than ""male socialisation"" or ""toxic masculinity"" because male animals with penises sexually and violently abuse females, babies and females of other species routinely in the same depraved ways as human males. Even when the culture shames men who abuse girls, most men and boys will seek it out when they can get away with it. You can see true male nature in the most popular videos on porn sites: these are screenshots by Suzzan Blac with all nudity blurred http://theviolenceofpornography.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-destruction-of-innocence.html http://theviolenceofpornography.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-strangulation-of-women.html.


If you get to know men who get outraged about Muslim pimps, you'll find out pretty quickly they are so angry because they don't feel like *they* can get away with abusing teenage girls like those men can. Also the Asian gangs usually prostitute their victims to white/non-muslim men including policemen, which is one of the reasons white men covered it up for them when women and families were fighting to stop them. A man I knew who was up in arms about Muslim rape gangs was recently arrested for sexually abusing a 14 year old girl. Tommy Robinson himself is a wife-beater. These men are not outraged at prostitution and sexual abuse itself. They seek out and defend teen porn of girls brought into prostitution by trafficking gangs and single pimps in exactly the same way by men of all kinds. 


Rachel Moran speaks about her experience as a prostituted child and how men were *more* excited to learn she was 15 and enjoyed raping her more because of it. I'll copy excerpts but the whole piece and her book Paid For are a must-read if you're interested in this topic:

&gt; In order to be most highly in demand in prostitution, you don’t need to be the prettiest flower in the field; you just need to be among the youngest. And what you can or cannot do with your body is irrelevant; it just matters that it hasn’t been on the planet for very long.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; One of the commonest questions that comes through on any brothels phone line is ‘What age is the youngest girl you have?’ I could not count the times I have been asked that question, and I defy anybody who has answered a brothels phone to tell the blatant lie that it is not the commonest question they’ve been asked too.


&gt; Whenever any evidence of teenaged prostitution is revealed the pro-prostitution lobby move immediately to put forth the preposterous assertion that this town is somehow different or unique. The attitude is always either ‘thirteen-year-olds, good Lord, who ever heard of such a thing?’ – or ‘thirteen-year-olds, good Lord, we could clear up this situation if we legalised prostitution!’ – as if somehow the demand for adolescent bodies would vanish if only we’d make the sale of adult bodies okay!
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Usually, however, they will simply deny that adolescent prostitution is widespread, or that adolescents are much in demand in the first place.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; Their purpose is consistently the same; it is to deny and refute the sick and twisted nature of what actually goes on in prostitution. The truth they don’t want to you know is that men who pay for sex will most often opt to pay for a fifteen-year-old over a seventeen-year-old, a seventeen-year-old over a nineteen-year-old, a nineteen-year-old over a twenty-one-year-old, and so on and so forth.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; Now, let me be very clear about this – I will be called a liar for having asserted the above. It will be said that I am trying to demonise punters, that I am telling lies about their preferences and proclivities. I wish I was. In my first year in prostitution, when I was fifteen-years-old, I was used by countless hundreds of men; I truly couldn’t say how many. I saw up to ten men a day so you may do the maths for yourself (the thoughts of doing that calculation disturbs me). As I stated in my Examiner article back in February, **men were so obviously aroused by my youth it made them climax very quickly, so I soon learned to tell them how old I was in order to shorten the whole ordeal**. I made it a policy; it was one of the first things I said when I got into the car – not that I needed to bring up the subject because it was usually one of the first questions asked of me.
&gt;
&gt; In all those hundreds of men, one man, just ONE, turned his van around and brought me back to where he’d found me.

(That man came back when she was 16 to rape her ""legally"".) Rachel talks on TV you can find on YouTube https://youtu.be/J_-IzBtDmWA and organises with prostitution survivors such as Fiona Broadfoot who was a trafficking victim in Bradford https://youtu.be/d14Kqd8Xm0k. Julie Bindel and Harriet Wistrich work with survivors in the legal system to actually help victims of prostitution. They have fought jail sentences for women who killed their pimps and rapists. They worked with Fiona to get rid of the legal requirement for victim's prostitution charges to be given on job applications.

228,fhr3sa5,"lets take a step back and try to see if a different perspective makes any sense.

why will a woman, who will not give most men the time of the day, forsake all her relationships, cut off all ties, lie to parents and BFFs, run away with a stranger?

i have a theory.  it is 'cost of marriage'.  every child knows marriages are costly. put yourself in position of a girl whose parents are not in a position to finance a costly marriage.  there is always talk about 'choti ki shaadi ke liye bandobast'.  a girl would go on a guilt trip.  no one likes to be a burden.   hence a girl tries to solve the problem her own way.

i would say that muslim boys are quick to pounce on the opportunity, and less ethical.  besides, most intercaste eloping where the girl stays hindu, end up with one or the other kind of murder.  so far i have not heard of any occurence of muslim boy being killed by parents of hindu girl.  so hindu girl considers eloping with a muslim boy the best option.

in some corner of their mind, the girls are aware they are being played.  they want to be played.  it is projected as love jihad, but girls are complicit.  they want to save their parents from financial misery, at the same time not going the fast track to widowhood.  for a sensitive hindu girl, eloping with a muslim boy is the best option.

we can change that.  let us ask ourselves one question.  between my daughter marrying a hindu boy of a different caste, and marrying a muslim, what would i prefer?  and then accept inter caste marriages.  in case she will marry a muslim, the girls parents will have no say in her future.  when a girl marries a hindu boy, her parents should stop interfering in her life, starting from how the marriage is conducted."

You'll have to go watch the long investigative report that got her forced out of Parliament at risk of losing her citizenship.

&gt; (did she also fake genital mutilation?)

In light of all of the other lies, it's foolish to just assume she's telling the truth. Nothing else in her story has been remotely corroborated. 

&gt; it's reasonable to have some concern about immigration, especially from islamic countries. unless you ignore the proven difficulty of integrating large, self-segregating groups of immigrants.

Sure, but that's not what's being claimed. The claim is that it's already done, that Europe has been overrrun, that Muslim demographics are going to cause a civil war in France, etc. You're using what's known as the motte/bailey fallacy. You have to defend the absurd claims not the ones you've massaged into being soft. 

&gt; and news from all over europe of things that wouldn't normally happen, such as the sexual assault epidemic in germany on NYE or the rotheram scandal. do you think immigration had no easily visible negative effects on life in rotterdam, brussles or malmö?

Have you somehow missed the massive numbers of recent rape investigations that have been covered up in the Catholic Church, in major sports institutions, at major universities, at federal agencies, etc.? This is a glaring demonstration of bias. Take Rotherham for example. To conclude this is remotely unique is bananas. A major US university and the US Olympic program recently got caught protecting the molestation of HUNDREDS of professional, teenage athletes. And you also need to consider another important element, when the victims of these crimes are discriminated groups, police agencies often don't care. There's a never ending list of black murder victims in the US, for example, who don't even gain enough attention to bother law enforcement. 

&gt; except that it was written quite shortly after the prophet's life, giving muslims less wiggle-room. the prophet was a violent, expansionist, polygamist, pedophile warlord, whereas jesus was a victimized, masochistic hippie virgin. it's fantastically easy to draw ISIS-like doctrines from the qur'an and the hadith, just read the bloody book. the same is not true for most other big religions. the old testament is arguably worse than the qur'an (containing genocide), but far less prescriptive, more self-contradictory and moderated as well as contradicted by the new testament.

All of that can be true, and it's simultaneously true that Christianity only recently ended its fascist imperialism and that Muslim Americans are more progressive than white Christians. By your logic that should be impossible."
232,f0vkl19,"Allright, fair enough. Maybe my life story will give you more context on why I am so passionatly anti islam;

I was muslim from birth till 24 years old. I started studing Arabic History and Muhammed’s life when I was 20 which gradually let me see the truth about Islam and Religion in a whole as just recycled man Made Ideology over thousands of years.

When I could no longer deny Muhammed’s terrible deeds like pedophilia, rape, slave owning, his racism against blacks and all the murder and oppression I left Islam. When my family found out they disowned me and my cousins nearly beat me to death. In the Hospital staff neglected me contantly as I was an apostate.

When I came out of the Hospital to find my home village in hostility towards me and after enough death threats I decided I would flee as far away from islam and muslims as I could.

I came to Greece to find safety but as I was placed in a refugee camp with mostly muslim refugees I was again surrounded by people that hated me, for I was not shy to admit my aposty when asked about my faith. I spend almost a year there in which I was beaten up 3 times, stabbed once and robbed countless of times. When I asked for help from fellow refugees people said I should not have provoked them.... Again proving in Islam being an unbeliever amids Muslims is enough provacation to kill you.

Next I was shipped of to france, Belgium, and then Germany in which all those Asylums I was prayed on by muslims.

At last one and a half year ago I got a kind of Visum in lack of better Words to live in The Netherlands. Within months I was beaten up again by muslim youth in a city called Gouda, which is basicly run by Muslim street thugs by now, for not greeting back with a Salaam....

I am now heavily involved with politics and am seeing the EU rapidly becoming a Sharia occupied hellhole.

France, Belgium, the UK and Germany already have huge problems with muslim immigrants, entire cities (Paris) are becoming ghetto’s where Gays and non-Muslim girls are harresed and beaten up.

Every day more and more people see the destruction that Islam brings to the West and I fear it will become A religious war in our life time."
233,eodwoa3,"She didn’t say the us military was equivalent to al Queda, that’s nuts.

She did say the us military was responsible for hundreds if not thousands of deaths in Mogadishu, Somalia, her home country. This is objectively true. She did point out that the US has a real problem killing innocent people and no one pays attention to it.

Interesting to note that Trump currently is seeking to pardon literal war criminals, including a former SEAL who was turned in by his teammates because he murdered numerous civilians for fun. 

She technically said that about 9/11, but her comment was taken entirely out of context. She said that because a small group of people did a bad thing, millions of people had their civil rights taken away (true). She was discussing how Muslim Americans are constantly treated as if they personally caused 9/11. Ironically, the backlash proved her point because a bunch of people accused her of supporting 9/11 because she’s Muslim. Even if she did (she doesn’t), no politician would be that fucking stupid.


It’s very important to understand that things you hear about ilhan Omar and rashida tlaib are part of a larger strategy.

Antifa exists to defend and combat the oppressed against fascists. Again you promote this morally bankrupt notion that the right calling for genocide and oppression is the same as the members of the left being willing to use violence to protect groups that the right wishes to murder and oppress.

236,ek6uiwf,"Devaluation, Ancestral Eugenics, ridding the world, ridding male empires of the undesirables

 and that is what Islam sees when they see homosexuals and they hang them and behead them

Hitler did it, he murdered homosexuals and he got his idea of Eugenics from the Americans who tried to prove all women and black people were intellectually inferior to the white male

and Americans got their idea of Eugenics from Darwin, and he got his idea of Eugenics from Aristotle

who propagated the idea the female was so inferior to the male, she was actually a deformed male and he said anyone who was born with deformities should be eliminated from male empires, cos they are only a drag on them

and Mohammed said himself, pre Islam men buried the majority of their new born daughters alive because they had a preference for sons..

The cult of manhood is toxic to anyone born outside of it.

Islam is not concerned with protecting their children, Islam is concerned with protecting their Islamic ideology and all their traditional customs that come with it..

cos the glue that binds all male empires together is oppressing women and girls

Muslim girls are expected to wait on their Muslim brothers hand and foot cos that is their role in Muslim societies and that is what props them all up..

237,eh99dtv,"Ah, so they have to use statistics from only 2018 in order to confirm their beliefs. They would be correct if the question was specifically ""Can you spot the greatest risk of an extremist murder in 2018?"" or if the title was ""The Real Culprits of 2018"". I used the ADL's data on extremist killings from 2008-2017 since it's more genuine to the real-World average to use a decade rather than selectively choosing last year only. The percentage of extremist murders that Muslim Americans committed is actually higher than what I recalled reading, 26% versus 23%. Considering White Americans are 73.3% of the population and commit 74% of extremist murders (I combined 71% right-wing and 3% left-wing even though all of the right-wing and left-wing extremists probably aren't white) and Muslim Americans are 1.1% of the population and commit 26% of the extremist murders, math will tell you that the average Muslim American is 22-23x more likely to be an extremist murderer than a White American. Here's the ADL's data: [https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-report-white-supremacist-murders-more-than-doubled-in-2017](https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-report-white-supremacist-murders-more-than-doubled-in-2017)"

Also, why is this such an issue for Germany? The US has the same immigrants, and getting them in higher rates, and doesn’t have a problem. Muslim Americans are actually less racist and anti jewish than American Christians.

245,e021pbn,"50k? lol.. maybe 50k from the US taxpayer. they are free for women.

In western nations, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other Muslim countries women can contact their nearest woman's group or NGO for help and if they claim they feel that their husband will be abusive if he finds out she's not a virgin, she can get a free hymenoplasty to hide the truth from him. THIS IS WHAT THE UNITED NATIONS HELPS TO FUND.

Of course, if you live in a country like Sweden, the taxpayers will fund the hymen restoration surgery: ""Surgical reconstructions of the hymen, a fold of skin found at a woman's vaginal opening, are being performed by both public and private practitioners in Stockholm, a new report shows.

The study has caused alarm among local health officials and politicians, who were previously unaware that such operations took place at all, let alone at tax payer-funded health clinics.""

Even the Saudis are on the UN gravy train and can't come together to get rid of these clinics:

The subject has become notable enough to spark public debate among Saudis, with some preachers issuing religious proclamations about the permissibility of such surgeries. One notable fatwa by the prominent Islamic preacher Sheikh Salman Al Ouda argued that hymen restoration procedures were acceptable given the serious consequences some women faced in the event of questions emerging about their virginity.

""In such a case, it is permissible for her to do it in order to protect herself as well as her life and future. This is a grave social matter that may end up in the murder of women,” Al Ouda said, citing a United Nations study that found that 5,000 women were murdered annually in so-called honor killings. Even fear of death can't stop these girls from slutting around before marriage!

These clinics are in EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. And they're free! She just has to lie and says she thinks her husband will get mad and hit her over finding out she lied about being a virgin. In France it's an epidemic where muslim girls are slutting around like there's no tomorrow then getting their hymens repaired to fool the beta provider that marries her. The United Nations steals money from American taxpayers who then give money to women's groups who then fund women wanting to repair their hymens so they can deceive their husbands.

246,dyar60u,"&gt;I'm of indigenous heritage

i dunno.  it's hard to believe you.  especially if you're Israeli.

&gt; i find islam to be highly offensive to human dignity

that's because of arrogance and Israeli propaganda.  

&gt;i find the only god is allah"" bullshit to be bigoted against indigenous peoples

that's because you are clearly not an intelligent person who can understand even the most simple of concepts.

&gt;some of the most oppressed people on earth.

yep, your vague, broad group of people totally had a uniform history across the globe.

&gt;muhammed is literally lying about the gods of my idignenous ancestors.

because we all know, if you spread goat shit on your face, the sun god will make your crops grow!

&gt;i find that bigotry offensive.

people can believe whatever they want.  

&gt;Islamic govts seek to force Islamic ideas on all, even amongst non-muslims. it is bigoted for that

Islamic governments do not dictate what Islam is.  Islamic governance is against Islam itself, as the Quran forbids forcing religions onto people.  not even in any poetic way.  simply ""There is no compulsion in the religion.""  It's a very well known quote from the Quran.  Someone who's so offended by Islam should know it.  Governments are always hypocritical, and every group of people on earth, even your vague indigenous people, have done hypocritical shit in the name of power.  It's called being human.  blame Islam all you want, that just allows the hypocrites free reign to continue their bullshit while you whine about a janitor that bows 5 times a day or whatever.

&gt;I'm going to bet that the shitty muslim govts have experts that are better versed in islam, than you, internet rando.

oh, something as widespread as Islam can only be known by governments?  Governments KNOW islam, doesn't mean they act as Muslims.  I was born and raised Muslim, in the US.  I studied the history of Islam as my major, and I teach in a huge American Muslim community.  I know more than you do, where you learn Islam from looking at a minority of governments in Islamic history.

&gt;Islam is a bigoted untruth spread by a violent murdering con-man

Muhammad was at war ONLY with the Meccans, who banished all Muslims from Mecca, stole the property, and then waged a war of extermination against the Muslims.  During the entire conflict, both sides claimed about 1000 losses.  1000 dead in about 10 years since the Muslims were forced into armed conflict by the Meccans.

2000 dead total.  over 10 years.  These were barely battles.  Mecca surrendered without a battle even. The peak of Muhammad's control was...just Mecca and Medina.  That's it.  All expansion of the Muslim Empires happened AFTER muhammad's death.  Muhammad did not even allow his property to be given to his family after he died, it was dispersed among the community.  He also remained in his average house in Medina, and allowed his companions to rule the 2 cities.

again, thank you for exposing your ignorance for me :D

&gt; female sex slaves that he raped repeatedly for decades

source?  oh right.  there isn't one.  Muhammad directly and indirectly freed over 60 thousand slaves in his lifetime.

&gt;it is well documented he was a slaver and owned female sex slaves, these are facts.

everyone had slaves.  You either had slaves, or were a slave.  that was the nature of the world 1400 years ago.  The Quran actually demands that slaves give consent before having sex with their masters, a huge reform that Muhammad brought to the region that effectively ended the acceptance of raping slaves.  Look up Mut'ah, you ignoramus. 

&gt;look at Sikhs, or Zoroastrians, similar ethnicities/""race""/genetic backgrounds to muslims in different areas, yet not oppressing like the muslim govts? why is that?

Sikhs arrived within the Muslim world lmao.  They were directly inspired by Islam.  

Zoroasters did try to oppress Muslims.  but the mosques appealed more to the lower classes of Persia, and Zoroastrianism was a very elitest religion that oppressed the lower classes, which made Islam appeal to them greatly.

some religions are just more logical.  you gotta learn to deal with that.

&gt;maybe it is because it all comes down to ideas and not race like you so ignorantly assume

you can still be a bigot.  you keep insisting the term ""race"" matters.  semantics, my friend.  you are a foolish, hateful bigot who hates just to hate, but you think it's ok because it's technically not racism.  

&gt;maybe you just dont understand islam?

oh the irony.

&gt;being in a ""muslim"" country is literal hell on earth for non-muslim lgbt and religious minorities

just like everywhere else on earth until...like...the 80s?  not even, in regards to lgbt, who basically only started being openly accepted like...10 years ago.  

also, all Muslim MPs in germany voted to legalize gay marraige.  All Muslims in the house or reps in the US supported gay marraige.  Muslims support gay marraige in the US more than Christians, and even Jews!

https://niskanencenter.org/blog/muslim-americans-are-more-likely-to-reject-violence-intolerance-than-many-americans/

&gt;there is a difference from what is supposedly in a book and the way it is actually practiced

there are literally thousands of ways it's practiced...

&gt;with all the oppression at the hand of literal muslim govts staffed with people who are better experts in the religion than you it is hard to believe that oppression isnt part of the religion

and what do you base this off of?  your desire to have a reason to hate?  the book is right there, translated into many languages. you can read it yourself.  but you won't.  because you aren't the reader type.

&gt;that and the fact that the punishment for apostasy is actual death in the religion it sounds like a bullshit religion to me

only a law in a minority of Muslim states, and no scripture at all even hints that apostasy should be met with death.  There are dozens of hadith where people left Islam and Muhammad did nothing, most famously:

""A bedouin came to the Prophet and gave a pledge of allegiance for embracing Islam. The next day he came with fever and said (to the Prophet), ""Please cancel my pledge (of embracing Islam and of emigrating to Medina)."" The Prophet ignored the bedouin three times, who left the city.  He turned (to his people and said), ""Medina is like a furnace, it expels out the impurities (bad persons) and selects the good ones and makes them perfect.""

&gt;it is literally a religion of bigotry

can you show me a single line from the quran, a single one, that backs this claim.  Pointing to governments does not work, as governments have done lots of good and lots of bad.  There is a reason there are still, to this day, a variety of Religions within the Muslim world.  As you said, Zoroastrianism still exists, Druze and Sikhs appeared WITHIN the Muslim world, Christianity and Judaism persists (until WWI is when all this changed). 

But India has actually purged religions like Buddhism.  China has outlawed all non-chinese religions except for Buddhism for most of it's history.  Europe literally purged the entire continent of non-Christians several times (the crusades, Constantine's forceful conversions, the reconquista, and even the holocaust just targeted white people who weren't the correct religion.  and lets not forget how European non-muslims killed 9 out of every 10 person in the Americas, killed 95% of native Australians, and literally raped Africa into a decades long genocide.

The Muslim governments have had their share of evil acts, again, because they're human.  but the atrocities of the Muslim world pale in comparison to literally any other civilization on earth.  

and if you knew anything about society, history, culture, humanity...anything other than fear mongering Israeli propaganda has indoctrinated you with, you'd already know all these very basic facts about the Muslim world.  "

248,dvhij6a,"I studied classical Arabic.  you did not.  transgressors is used at different points in the Quran.  this verse refers to murderers. there is a reason that for the last 1400 years of Islamic history, this section was used in Islamic Law in regards to murder, and the Muslims didn't simply put every single criminal death across the entire Muslim world.

also, to expose your ignorance, Sharia translates to ""law"".  Saying anything against Sharia law is saying something is against ""law law"".

Because having 80% of people say they are Muslim and having 80% of Muslims follow the teachings of Islam are two very different things.

250,dpsnm0b,"&gt;Why do you accept the fact that the you can see how likely it is some law will pass on how much mony is spend lobbying?

Hard to crack politicians in a First Past the Post system

&gt;Also why are guns and murder totally fine on tv but not a boob?


Well, that's tough since on paper, it shouldn't be that big of a deal. However, America historically has been more of a sexually prudent nation. (Remember, the majority reason most Gentile or Non-Muslim Americans are circumcised here is traditionally going back to the idea of circumcised penises making a man less likely to masturbate). Although society itself is slowly changing to a less prudish nation, it's still different than most of the world.

Technically, cable television is 100% allowed to show nudity. FCC regulations on nudity only apply to terrestrial television (over-the-air) networks such as ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS and Fox.   There's a reason you can see nudity on a show like Game of Thrones. 

However, cable networks survive off advertising and advertisers historically don't like ""racy"" television and will pull advertising in certain situations. That's where Standards and Practices, a part of most non-premium cable networks comes to play. Standards and Practices makes their own networks self-censor to please advertisers. But this is also changing. 

&gt;And why the fuck is the word fuck is bad

Historically, curse words in general in the US were severely frowned upon. Some words have eased up on its taboo (ass, bitch, whore) while some words haven't (cunt). However, fuck seems to exist in this weird grey area. 

For example, in films, fuck can change what your rating in your film is depending on the context. PG-13 films can typically throw out 1-2 fucks without getting an R rating (17 years old and older only without supervision) unless in a sexual context which is always an R.  This again has to do with American prudism. 

"
251,dn3l45b,"&gt;Many white christians only oppose gay marriage, but unlike most muslims, they don't want gays killed.

Thousands of white Americans believe gay people should be killed for being gay, and those are just the ones we arrested for murdering a gay person for no reason other than the fact the person is gay, the number who want to do it is surely higher. Do you have a source to show that a higher % of muslim Americans are violent, or believe something violent should happen to them,towards gays v white Americans?"

"
254,dhp8mcy,"How many Muslims do you know, though? Muslim-Americans are pretty moderate and judging billions of people from a few prominent media incidents which come to mind is like me pretending all Christians are like the mom from *Carrie* or something.

I tend to see fundamentalism as a social problem, like crime, best explained by living in more desperate contexts where it flourishes. Plenty of Muslim nations were pretty egalitarian in terms of gender and whatnot before proxy wars which destabilized them leading to more extreme groups filling that power vacuum. And there are tons of areas with majority-Muslim populations with all sorts of different ways of living and organizing themselves. I think once we consider ourselves to be at war with an entire ethnicity or religion, we're getting close to that brand of apocalyptic extremism that really fosters some pretty awful treatment of human beings.

&gt; If wanting your nation defended from barbarians with incompatible ideologies makes you a loony zealot bigot, then I guess I am one.

Well yeah, me too. ISIS/ISIL are active warriors against civilization. They're destroying relics and history which have existed for thousands of years—if everybody was like them those things would have been destroyed long ago. They're murdering their own people for ""apostasy"" and imposing schools of thought which require rigid, unbending application of scripture—can't do that unless there was more diversity of thought and living allowed before. They're imposing restrictive dress and repressive courtship practices on women—can't do that unless they had more freedom before. A paramilitary, fundamentalist group like ISIS flourishes in limited areas of sudden instability in the same ways that we have paramilitary groups in the US with drastic plans, but the institutional resources to combat them.

Cause again, I know a bunch of Muslim people and this ""AYAYAYAYA"" beheading caricature is really unfair to them. Most people of any religious stripe compartmentalize the more brutal and uncompromising aspects of their scripture and history; they're not different in that regard. Plus most of this extremism popped up in the last few decades; it isn't inherent to the faith."
255,dgve271,"exactly, all kids are tied to their parents and their community for economic survival. The difference is that the rules most western parents set at least by now are quite different to the rules most muslim parents set. 


Just a few decades ago, in most western countries if someone wasn't straight it wasn't accepted by their parents or community, and they would mostly hide it. In the last few years, this has changed, because society has become more accepting to it, and it is often the case that kids can be more open and they will be helped out by someone in their community, from teachers at school to uncles and aunts, and they will certainly be able to walk around dressed however they like as long as their parents don't see them. When the larger community doesn't support the abusive parent, the most damage they can do is have their kids pretend they are straight in front of them. But a few years ago, in the time of don't ask don't tell, lots of kids were forced to live their entire lives as someone they weren't, and it depended largely on how their families handled it. There were parents who tried to accept, understand and help their kids, there were parents who would get angry and just kick them out of the house, and others that would try to ""turn them straight"" like jihadi mike was still doing at least until he became vice president.


Within muslim communities, a large number of behaviours are seen similarly to how homosexuality was seen in the west a few years ago. Of course not by all the parents, and even the most extreme ones I don't think kill their kids, most parents view their kids as theirs to mold in that kind of culture, so they try to ""fix"" them. Murder is likely extremely rare, they just shut them in and get them married.


I dont know enough to speak about what happens to boys. They don't have the obvious dress and movement restrictions of girls. Gay ones likely just hide it, since homophobia is rampant in the muslim community. All gay friends I have visiting or living/studying in munich and berlin tell me the only areas they can't freely hang out in are the muslim neighbourhoods, people will spit at them and call them names. 


Most muslim girls are made to wear scarves when they reach puberty, they won't be allowed to go out with friends unsupervised, or hang out with boys. I live in the Netherlands and see this every day. Groups of girls in scarves, very rarely with a girl without a scarf with them. Even in my university there are tons of women wearing the scarf, it is seen as a sign of acceptance to the muslims not to say anything about it, to support the abuse in their culture. I used to live in a house in a largely social housing neighbourhood for a year, with a school in the back yard. On 2-3 occasions, it was a muslim girl's birthday and they had girls-only parties at the school.

My housemate who has lived there for 15+ years and knows a lot of the neighbours told me of two girls that he knows about that were shut in by their families. One was a young girl, around 12 or so, who was talking with him on whatsup since they were friends since she was about 8, and she would often ask him for advice on small things. Then one day she said something about being scared, that she was becoming a woman and she would have to wear the scarf, that her father was telling her she wasn't a child anymore and things would change. He wrote back but she never replied again, presumably her family took her phone away. The other was a typical case, the groom and his parents lived in the apartment almost right next to my friends', and the parents arranged a marriage with a girl from their country. When she first came here she was very free, even took off her scarf after a few days, she would walk around in the park and go to the super market alone. The guy's dad seemed pretty pissed about it, and after they had their first kid, my housemate told me he heard sounds indicating she was being beaten 2-3 times. He was scared and didn't know what to do about it. She wears a scarf now and has three kids with the guy.


So, you ask how to deal with it. Well the problem is there is no clear way to deal with it. In western countries, culture and communities within each country were relatively homogeneous during the years of cultural change in the past few decades. There were established christian conservative notions of family, but the laws didn't support them, and there was an element of desire for change in society at large. In smaller towns it was difficult, but in bigger cities people could find a lot of others with the same desires as them. The muslim community today on the other hand is very resistant to change, because the fact that our laws don't support their customs and sharia law makes them feel threatened. When banning the scarf is discussed, in their minds it is equivalent to a foreign country in the 50's forcing western women to wear mini skirts and bikinis at the beach, forcing the unification of all-male and all-female schools, a complete moral breakdown in their minds. At the same time, when you see even illegal behaviour, it can be difficult to report it. The police will come by, and very little is usually done about it, since the women don't have anywhere to go and don't want to leave. The abusive husband might be taken to the precinct for the night but he will be back, and whoever made the call to the police might get in trouble and will live in fear of being attacked by him. A guy who is violent like that and considers it his right, or even his duty to beat his wife to ""correct"" her won't react nicely to a christian foreigner telling him how to run his family and calling the cops on him.


So, there are a few solutions, and they are of course extremely hard and expensive, which is why nobody really can help the situation that much. One way would be to have very heavy penalties for these kinds of crime and practical assurances that the victim is supported and the perpetrator is not a danger, so that people are not afraid to report actual crimes. When it comes to the children of extreme parents, our laws can't stop them from raising their daugher to cover herself and taking her phone so she don't talk to boys. Schools can have classes that try to explain things to kids though.

In the west, we didn't really have to fight religion in the last couple of centuries. We don't know how to do it. It is obvious that we don't, because otherwise fundamentalist christianity wouldn't have expanded in the US in the last few years. What happened instead is that other waves of social thinking, dreams and ideas of what life is all about were more attractive, interesting and new compared to stale religion. Communism, liberalism, the sexual revolution, economic growth leading to jobs leading to the ability to live without your parents giving you money, they let westerners get free of the bullshit. It helped that in christianity the oppressed were not as oppressed as they are in islam, we had Queens for example centuries ago. Tell someone in Saudi Arabia they might have a queen and they will die laughing.


In reality the only way to deal with all this is to have people who think of themselves more as Dutch, German, American, etc with muslim ancestry rather than muslims. And of course this is why we are mostly cool with each other and we live almost entirely in peace. The majority of muslims, are kinda like the majority of christians- not really practicing their religion. Many of the 2nd and 3rd generation people don't care about it, being muslim has faded into their cultural background. You can't achieve this if you are dependent on your conservative parents to pay the rent. The economic crisis is breaking up the processes by which all the groups making up each country in the west used to homogenize with each other, this is why everyone is freaking out with muslims"
256,di3ka7c,"Often people want to go for something exotic. In the UK, lots of girls like fucking guys from a different ethnicity. I live in Asia and Ive lost count of the amount of girls who are interested in me simply because I am white. They want something different.

 The guys do too though, although it isnt as easy to get access. Muslim girls are by and large repressed and would get/have been murdered by their family for sleeping with white guys. Muslim males are left free mostly. 

 It is still quite rare to see mixed couples settling down though, perhaps because it is still 87% white in the UK."
257,fzi8cyr,"It looks like there's no actual article here? It just looks like a title, a header, and a picture of an elephant to me.

edit: Found the [article here](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/07/27/opinion/gops-moral-trap/?outputType=amp). I'll paste it as well. 

&gt;There was a time when the Republican Party had the moral high ground. Founded in the 1850s on the principle of restoring the nation’s governing ideals, it stood for equality for Black Americans. For their part, the Democrats were the party of Jim Crow. Later, when the GOP was hijacked by the robber barons, Theodore Roosevelt and other progressives fought to return the party to its founding principle. Even as late as the 1960s, a moral impulse led Republican lawmakers, without whom the bill would have failed, to support the Civil Rights Act.

&gt;Democracies depend on norms — unwritten rules about how leaders and citizens should behave. One norm is forbearance — the idea that political power should be used with restraint rather than weaponized and taken to its lawful limits. Such norms have little standing in today’s Republican Party.

&gt;There was, for example, no constitutional barrier to prevent Wisconsin’s outgoing Republican governor, Scott Walker, in consort with the state’s Republican Legislature, to strip the governor’s office of power before the incoming Democratic governor could take office in 2019. But it violated the longstanding norm of American politics that the outgoing party accept the change in power that comes with losing an election.

&gt;North Carolina’s Republican Legislature pulled the same stunt in 2016, when the state’s voters elected a Democratic governor. Republican state legislatures, assisted by computer models, have also pushed gerrymandering beyond ethical limits. In Wisconsin’s 2018 election, Republican candidates received only 45 percent of the popular vote but won 63 percent of the State Assembly’s seats. In a 2019 5-to-4 Supreme Court ruling, the five Republican appointees on the court held that Wisconsin’s rigged system did not violate voters’ constitutional rights.

&gt;The 1965 Voting Rights Act was designed to end the voter suppression that had long plagued America’s elections. It worked as intended until Republicans began devising schemes to keep minorities from voting. In 2017, North Dakota Republicans enacted a law that requires voters to have written proof of a residential address before they are eligible to vote. The law targets Native Americans who live on rural tribal lands, which don’t have street names and numbers on all of their roads. Here, too, the Supreme Court’s Republican appointees in a 5-to-4 decision allowed the policy to stand.

&gt;The idea of disenfranchising minority voters was hatched by the Republican-controlled legislatures of Indiana and Georgia. Enacted in 2006, Indiana’s law required residents to have a government-issued photo ID, such as a driver’s license or passport, in order to register to vote. Republican legislators knew who they were targeting. Minority group members, young adults, and people of low income — all of whom tend to vote Democratic — are less likely than other Americans to have a passport or driver’s license.

&gt;Since then, roughly 30 Republican-controlled states have enacted voter-ID laws. Some were forced to reenact their law after a court struck down the first attempt. Pennsylvania’s first try required applicants without a government-issued ID to travel to a state motor vehicle office to get one, even though nine of the state’s counties didn’t have an office and the office in nine others was open only one day a week.

&gt;Although Republicans say that voter IDs are intended to prevent voter fraud, there is no evidence for the claim, and their real purpose is clear. As longtime Republican political consultant Carter Wrenn said: “Of course it’s political. Why else would you do it?” Republican lawmakers in Florida and Pennsylvania slipped up and publicly said that their aim was to suppress the Democratic vote.

&gt;Republicans are playing with fire. Voter suppression lengthens the memory of the suppressed. The votes of Black Americans are now all but lost to the GOP. Latinx voters vote 2 to 1 Democratic. Asian-Americans, who not that long ago sided with the Republican Party, are now one of the Democrats’ most loyal voting groups. Muslim Americans are five times more likely to vote Democratic than Republican.

&gt;It could take a generation for Republicans to regain the trust of the nation’s minorities, and the GOP can ill-afford to wait. By then it may be too late. In less than three decades, minorities will be a majority of the US population."
258,e4mt8ml,"That's the experience for MOST people.       
How many Muslims in Afghanistan have you interacted with?    
Muslim Americans are less religious.   As are most Jewish Americans.    Most WESTERN versions of religions are more tolerant.     
The people who interacted with the 9/11 hijackers thought they were just normal people.   They didn't advocate violence.    It would be pretty stupid if they did.     
    
The problem is, the silence majority of people enable the evil of their sects to operate.      
   
When Hitler was executing Jews,  most Germans were against it.   They WOULDN'T condemn him for doing it though.   Nobody spoke out against it.    Most Germans were GOOD PEOPLE.      
      

There are very obviously bad people in every group.  The problem lies in when that group ALLOWs or enables those evil people.      
    
Because we don't know whats in peoples minds;  I look at how they're being taught.      
IF they're raised in places that teach tolerance, and acceptance; It's probably safe to say they're going to be good people.    If they raised in a place where the teaches are,  ""Everyone else is bad,  Kill them""  they're probably not the people you want to live next door. "

260,fwzfemx,"She's pretty based, alright. You can get a good summary of her (and more broadly Danish Social Democrats') political position [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#Political_positions). Some notable stances include:

&gt;In a recent biography, Frederiksen stated: 'For me, it is becoming increasingly clear that the price of unregulated globalisation, mass immigration and the free movement of labour is paid for by the lower classes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Social Democrats voted for a law banning wearing of burqas and niqabs while abstaining during a vote on a law on mandatory handshakes irrespective of religious sentiment at citizenship ceremonies and on a plan to house criminal asylum seekers on a bridgeless island on which they would have to stay at night. Frederiksen also backed the right-wing populist Danish People's Party in their paradigm shift push to make repatriation rather than integration the goal of asylum policy.   
&gt;  
&gt;Labeling economic foreign policies of Europe as too liberal, Frederiksen has criticised other social democratic parties for losing their voters' trust by failing to prevent globalisation chipping away at labour rights, increasing inequality and exposing them to uncontrolled immigration.  
&gt;  
&gt;Frederiksen has referred to Islam as a barrier to integration, arguing that some Muslims ""do not respect the Danish judicial system"", that some Muslim women refuse to work for religious reasons and that Muslim girls are subject to ""massive social control"" and has called for Muslim schools to be closed.

If only our (Finnish) sosdems were like Denmark's..."
261,fopmfr4,"Mette Frederiksen, Prime Minister of Denmark, is Authcenter's girl. 

""Frederiksen is a vocal opponent of [prostitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution). For many years, she has strongly advocated the prohibition of the purchase of sex as in [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Iceland), [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Norway) and [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Sweden).[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-21) In 2002, she opened the debate on the prohibition of prostitution and was behind the 2009 congressional decision that the Social Democrats would ""work for a ban on the purchase of sexual services"".[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-22) Frederiksen also became increasingly sceptical of [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalism) [mass immigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_immigration) as she believes it has had negative impacts for much of the population, a more pressing issue since at least 2001 after the [11 September attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11_September_attacks) which intensified during the [2015 European migrant crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_European_migrant_crisis). She has argued that perception of the Social Democrats adopting the [Third Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Way) and practicing [centrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrist), [neoliberal economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberal_economics) and supporting unrestricted [globalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_globalisation) contributed to the party's poor electoral performance in the early 21st century. In a recent biography, Frederiksen stated: 'For me, it is becoming increasingly clear that the price of unregulated globalisation, mass immigration and the free movement of labour is paid for by the lower classes.'.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-The_Guardian-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-Politico-9)

Under Frederiksen, the Social Democrats voted in favor of a law allowing Danish authorities to confiscate money, jewellery and other valuable items from refugees crossing the border,[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-23) despite harsh condemnation from the [United Nations Human Right Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council)[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-24) and widespread comparisons between the plan and the treatment of [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) in [Nazi-occupied Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi-occupied_Europe).[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-25) Similarly, the Social Democrats voted for a law [banning wearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa_ban) of [burqas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa) and [niqabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqab) while abstaining during a vote on a law on mandatory handshakes irrespective of religious sentiment at citizenship ceremonies and on a plan to house criminal [asylum seekers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker) on an island used for researching contagious animal diseases. Frederiksen also backed the right-wing populist [Danish People's Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_People%27s_Party) in their paradigm shift push to make [repatriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation) rather than [integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_integration) the goal of asylum policy. She has called for a cap on non-Western immigrants, expulsion of asylum seekers to a reception centre in North Africa and forced labour for immigrants in exchange for benefits. Labeling economic foreign policies of Europe as too [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalism), Frederiksen has criticised other social democratic parties for losing their voters' trust by failing to prevent globalisation chipping away at labour rights, increasing inequality and exposing them to uncontrolled immigration.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-The_Guardian-8)

Frederiksen has referred to [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam) as a barrier to integration, arguing that some [Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims) ""do not respect the Danish judicial system"", that some Muslim women refuse to work for religious reasons and that Muslim girls are subject to ""massive social control"" and has called for Muslim schools to be closed.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-26) In an interview with [*Kristeligt Dagblad*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristeligt_Dagblad), Frederiksen called for the ""closure of all immigrant centres"" and for the ""resettlement of immigrants in North Africa"". These statements were strongly criticised by [Morten Østergaard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_%C3%98stergaard) (secretary of the [Danish Social Liberal Party - Radical Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Social_Liberal_Party)) and [Cristina Narbona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina_Narbona) (president of the [Spanish Socialist Workers' Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Socialist_Workers%27_Party)), who accused Frederiksen of [xenophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia).

266,fiug8k5,"Game?
These scumbags have been able to get away with this for over 30 years because of people like you. That's the shitty 'game'.

Their crimes overlooked, because it would cast a bad light on them, hence they were able to groom and rape and abuse girls with no problems. Thanks for that [slow clap]
Maybe there is actually a problem in those circles that makes them somehow excuse their behaviour [as in non muslim girls are infidels and hence worth nothing]. 
Only when we address this can we bring change and make a better society for EVERYONE.

This only came out by accident, otherwise these few that they caught, would still be at it [but there are plenty more that nobody dares to arrest, so have a celebratory cake].

Without people like you, we could really make a difference and arrest **every sex predator regardless of where they are from** and whatever they belief, this would help to keep us females safe. 

You can't keep something this serious quiet, just because it goes against your narrative. And you also can't downplay it and come up with idiotic whataboutism.

 In the UK it is actually illegal to commit a sex crime, that's why we arrest [white] sex criminals normally. The problem is that these guys weren't arrested for a looooooooong time because they were Asian and muslim.

**These Asian sex grooming gangs exist, it's not racist to highlight this!** [Especially not, if we are serious to end this sort of thing], but it sure is **sexist** to ignore them to the detriment of young vulnerable girls.

In order to change something you have to acknowledge it first, not cry and shout ""waississm""!"
267,f6i6j2e,"It's true the police would not have let this happen to Kate Middleton. And it's true that Muslim girls are sexually abused at high rates and it's underreported like most demographics. We're still stuck with a problem.

1. Most of the rape gangs were Pakistani, in fact, from one specific region.
2. Most of the victims were white girls living in poverty.
3. The rape gangs did NOT target girls of any other race save for a few Sikhs, and that was motivated by hate, too. The Sikh community made it very clear that they would stop it by any means necessary and fucking good for them- they did.
4. There is no equivalent of Chinese, Jamaican, Nigerian, or white men running gangs pursuing Pakistani girls, or any girls of a different race. Not at the same scale. Sure, there are criminals of other races that do violent and misogynistic things, but it's not all the same phenomena. 
5. The police and authorities went out of their way to protect the Pakistani rape gangs, to avoid upsetting the Pakistani community at large. THAT IS STRUCTURAL PRIVILEGE.
6. For any Pakistani activist in the UK who breathlessly claims to be gobsmacked and appalled about these ""bad apples"" I'd like to point out that the authorities did nothing about them because they were afraid to piss off Pakistani activists, clerics, politicians, and voters. That doesn't make them responsible for the rapes. But it does mean that they need to consider their privilege and the moral responsibilities that come with it. What message were the activists giving off when authorities covered these men's asses? 
7. The more people try to point to classism, sexism, and whataboutism, the angrier others get. Can you blame them?

Pakistani rape gangs targeted white girls because they were on the extreme end of bigotry that is found within the community at large. They were not stopped and are only sorta being addressed now because they do carry political privilege. They worked for this privilege to defend their own rights, and now they need to consider the rights of others along with it. This means taking a hard look in the mirror, a lot of community talks about how to do better, self-accountability, and hearing things that aren't pleasant. No dilution."
268,exr5yy3,"&gt;Frederiksen is a vocal opponent of [prostitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution). For many years, she has strongly advocated the prohibition of the purchase of sex as in [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Iceland), [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Norway) and [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Sweden).[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-17) In 2002, she opened the debate on the prohibition of prostitution and was behind the 2009 congressional decision that the Social Democrats would ""work for a ban on the purchase of sexual services"".[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-18) Frederiksen also became increasingly sceptical of [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalism) [mass immigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_immigration) as she believes it has had negative impacts for much of the population, a more pressing issue since at least 2001 after the [11 September attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11_September_attacks) which intensified during the [2015 European migrant crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_European_migrant_crisis). She has argued that perception of the Social Democrats adopting the [Third Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Way) and practicing [centrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrist), [neoliberal economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberal_economics) and supporting unrestricted [globalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_globalisation) contributed to the party's poor electoral performance in the early 21st century. In a recent biography, Frederiksen stated: ""For me, it is becoming increasingly clear that the price of unregulated globalisation, mass immigration and the free movement of labour is paid for by the lower classes"".[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-The_Guardian-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-Politico-9)  
&gt;  
&gt;Under Frederiksen, the Social Democrats voted in favor of a law allowing Danish authorities to confiscate money, jewellery and other valuable items from refugees crossing the border,[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-19) despite harsh condemnation from the [United Nations Human Right Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council)[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-20) and widespread comparisons between the plan and the treatment of [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) in [Nazi-occupied Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi-occupied_Europe).[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-21) Similarly, the Social Democrats voted for a law [banning wearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa_ban) of [burqas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa) and [niqabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqab) while abstaining during a vote on a law on mandatory handshakes irrespective of religious sentiment at citizenship ceremonies and on a plan to house criminal [asylum seekers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker) on an island used for researching contagious animal diseases. Frederiksen also backed the right-wing populist [Danish People's Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_People%27s_Party) in their paradigm shift push to make [repatriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation) rather than [integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_integration) the goal of asylum policy. She has called for a cap on non-Western immigrants, expulsion of asylum seekers to a reception centre in North Africa and forced labour for immigrants in exchange for benefits. Labeling economic foreign policies of Europe as too [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalism), Frederiksen has criticised other social democratic parties for losing their voters' trust by failing to prevent globalisation chipping away at labour rights, increasing inequality and exposing them to uncontrolled immigration.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-The_Guardian-8)  
&gt;  
&gt;Frederiksen has referred to [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam) as a barrier to integration, arguing that some [Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims) ""do not respect the Danish judicial system"", that some Muslim women refuse to work for religious reasons and that Muslim girls are subject to ""massive social control"".[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-22) In an interview with [*Kristeligt Dagblad*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristeligt_Dagblad), Frederiksen called for the ""closure of all immigrant centres"" and for the ""resettlement of immigrants in North Africa"". These statements were strongly criticised by [Morten Østergaard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_%C3%98stergaard) (secretary of the [Danish Social Liberal Party - Radical Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Social_Liberal_Party)) and [Cristina Narbona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina_Narbona) (president of the [Spanish Socialist Workers' Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Socialist_Workers%27_Party)), who accused Frederiksen of [xenophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia). However, her statements were praised by [Sigmar Gabriel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmar_Gabriel) (former leader of the [Social Democratic Party of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany)) in an op-ed for [*Handelsblatt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handelsblatt).[\[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen#cite_note-23)

Some aspects of Latin American crime have in fact developed religious overtones. The cult of *Santa Muerte,* based on the Catholic Lady of Guadalupe, is popular in Mexico among criminals, as is heavy emphasis on traditional Mexican Catholic symbols such as votive candles and tattoos of the Lady of Guadalupe. They do this to try and garner divine protection, despite the obvious hypocrisy. So just because they're doing things which go against their religion does not mean religion is not involved in some way.

The bigger issue is that the Mexican cartels don't bring Christianity *directly into their criminal actions* or use it to actively *justify* them. [The Islamic groups in question do just that:](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rotherham-grooming-gang-sexual-abuse-muslim-islamist-racism-white-girls-religious-extremism-a8261831.html)

&gt;As a teenager, I was taken to various houses and flats above takeaways in the north of England, to be beaten, tortured and raped over 100 times. I was called a “white slag” and “white c***” as they beat me.

&gt;They made it clear that because I was a non-Muslim, and not a virgin, and because I didn’t dress “modestly”, that they believed I deserved to be “punished”. They said I had to “obey” or be beaten.

&gt;Religious indoctrination is a big part of the process of getting young men involved in grooming gang crime. Religious ideas about purity, virginity, modesty and obedience are taken to the extreme until horrific abuse becomes the norm. It was taught to me as a concept of “othering”.

&gt;“Muslim girls are good and pure because they dress modestly, covering down to their ankles and wrists, and covering their crotch area. They stay virgins until marriage. They are our girls.

&gt;""White girls and non-Muslim girls are bad because you dress like slags. You show the curves of your bodies (showing the gap between your thighs means you’re asking for it) and therefore you’re immoral. White girls sleep with hundreds of men. You are the other girls. You are worthless and you deserve to be gang-raped.”

&gt;This hateful religious hypocrisy strikes people to their very core. But it’s far from unique. My main perpetrator quoted scriptures from the Quran to me as he beat me. 

They're often hypocrites and they're not following explicit shariah in terms of when it is appropriate to have sex outside of marriage, but many of them add a very explicitly Islamic theme to their actions. Regarding the European sex rings, the concept of covered Muslim women as pure while uncovered kuffar women are available for everything and *deserve* to be abused is obviously religious in nature and the cultural ideas about women come directly from Islam.

Comparing Mexican cartels to these cases is very ignorant considering the above facts. There are numerous criminal groups in Muslim countries which no one blames on Islam because they, while being Muslims, do not bring religion into it, just as the Mexican cartels don't.

The rape gangs explicitly bring religion in as a justification and cultural support for their behavior. "

282,dvoj9xq,"It's not a stick to beat up the muslim world, is it? It is the need to discuss how to protect British girls (whatever colour) from predatory and criminal sexual exploitation. Would I let me daughter live/rent in a predominantly muslim area? Not a fckn chance, unless she is chaperoned everywhere, like devout muslim girls are. Is she at risk from men generally? maybe, but the chances are worse in some places than others. Remember that girl who was sexual assaulted three separate times in central london? She was finally helped by passerby's because she was unconscious in the street. It used to be that being alone wasn't a GUARANTEE of being attacked."

286,dmqw77k,"&gt; So your choice has the material implications of not having healthcare for others.

Yep. 

&gt; Lol your choices are judged by their consequences, not whatever you dream up.

I'm not a strict believer in the ""Means Justify the Ends"" type of mentality. Also the consequences of my actions are that Muslim immigrants rights are violated, Muslim Americans are betrayed, and it sends a clear message to every other vulnerable minority in this country ""Your lives come second."" That in my opinion, is an unacceptable consequence.

&gt; You're the problem when people say people need to hold themselves responsible.

...How?

&gt; Your choice compromises healthcare for a ton of people, yet you don't care.

Never said I didn't care. Only that I refuse to betray the rights and trust of other people. If the consequence means that people don't receive universal healthcare. Then so be it. 

The future implications for even making such a compromise also need to be taken into account. If the rights of so many people can so be bargained. So can universal healthcare. Whose to say that those people will even have healthcare 10 years for now. 

Healthcare should be a decision we make in this country amicably. It should be a decision that lasts. It shouldn't just be some hail mary. In your scenario. Universal healthcare will be as 'temporary' as the Muslim ban. In that case, it's not even worth fighting for. It's a poison pill solution.

&gt; Yes, this is exactly my point.

Would you kill a man to harvest his organs and save 5 people then? The problem with these types of questions is that once you start applying the logic in other scenarios, then people begin realizing why individual rights are so highly cherished.

&gt; Yes it matters whether you did it for criminal liability. Just cuz your actions have indirect consequences, doesn't mean you're not responsible for your actions.

You're right to a very limited extent. You are responsible for your actions. But being passively responsible and being actively responsible are not the same thing.

For example, lets look at you. Instead of donating 20 bucks to make sure a child in sub-Saharan Africa or Haiti has enough food to survive, you probably spent it go to the movies. Are you now responsible for that child's death or that child starving? Because using your own logic, you would be.

&gt; Your ""integrity"" is nice; so would healthcare for millions of Americans. Interesting you chose your own personal feelings over others in this hypothetical scenario.

It's not about my personal feelings you sociopath. It's about the feelings of your fellow human beings whose rights are violated, it's about the feelings of your fellow citizens who are torn apart from their family, it's about the lives of refugees whose lives are now lost because their chance to escape to America was torn away from them, it's about the feelings of the many different groups in our country who are now wondering whether their rights, their safety, their freedom, is now up to be ""bartered"" with.

You need to learn see the bigger picture. "

294,dh5w4ba,"&gt; It means Afghanis are committing 6 times more violent crime towards the person than average

again, you seem to be ignoring logic here.  it means if one afghani commits a crime, because the numbers of afghanis are so low, it looks like a huge boost in the percent. just because you don't understand this simple statistical concept, doesn't mean anything. 

&gt;when we are talking about proportions.

exactly, so that means proportions are meaningless in this case. just because you cling to the numbers that push your agenda dishonestly, doesn't mean shit. it's still a very small number of people committing  the crimes. proportion is irrelavent outside of bias propaganda. 

the link you've given is a long read, and i'll look at it when i get home, but already can see your biases based on the fact you only referenced morrocans, while other groups don't fit your claim. 

&gt;I'm curious where you're from because criminality amongst second generation immigrants is a well established issue in European countries like the Netherlands/France

then why is it the opposite in the US, who have more muslims, and have had them for longer than europe?  i'm from SE michigan in the us, which has huge populations of latinos, african americans, and the most densely populated middle eastern population in the US (and possibly the world outside of the middle east) that has been established since the 50s, along with other large middle eastern communities in new york and southern california. 

and what actually happens in the US when middle eastern people/muslims immigrate to the us, is they reduce crime rates, increase property values, and intermarry. i grew up in middle of it. many family members are intermarried. many of my friends are half middle eastern. many of them are born to immigrants, but only speak english. 

actually, american muslims tend to reject violence more than non muslim americans. 

https://niskanencenter.org/blog/muslim-americans-are-more-likely-to-reject-violence-intolerance-than-many-americans/

so it seems like the xenophobic culture of europe is more to blame on how immigrants MAY turn out. considering america has no issue with them. my guess is european natives tend to refuse to hire non natives. hell, europe has had these exact issues with eastern europeans, even though, say, polish communities in the us thrive, but don't in western europe.

296,e3usudo,"Muslim American here. I really hope people will start realizing that their fellow Muslim Americans are THE best asset this country has in defeating extremists, especially Wahabbists. Muslim communities have already outed extremists and regularly reported red flags to authorities. Instead of the “deport all Muslims” rhetoric, realize that we are not going anywhere and it’s time to suck it up, make some friends, and work together to make extremism irrelevant. The best way to defeat extremism is education and opportunity. Discrimination and ostracizing only feeds extremism. 

Extremists hate “us” too and would just as soon shoot  non extremist Muslim than they would a non Muslim. They especially have a penchant for hating Shi’ite (which is what I am) the most. We’re all the enemy to them. We can only defeat them together."

That is a true American there. That is a beautiful sentiment that our current political climate, quite frankly, doesn't deserve. But the tribalism in this country has encouraged ""patriots"" to boo this person, to think of him as an enemy. Similar to the circumstances that allowed us to accept imprisoning a bunch of innocent people based simply on their race, there is a huge portion of this country that wants to deport all the muslims, all the hispanics.

300,fvakmc3,"&gt;so many young muslim-americans being drawn to the likes of buttar/sanders, in many cases because either they, their families or people like them have suffered for years with no end in sight, plenty of it at the hands of the united states government

I bet only a small % of muslim Americans are people who arrived from Iraq and Afghanistan since the war started. If you then include the people whose families had seen loss due to action of American military. The number would be even smaller. So, you are talking about a tiny fraction of American Muslim population. 

\&gt; why wouldn't a young iraqi or afghan-american whose family may have been  displaced or even killed find it offensive that people who were  responsible for such pain &amp; suffering are still members of elite  society with their actions swept under the rug?

Most of these folks were living under Saddam or Taliban's regime. Whatever negative impacts their families had due to NATO wars, it has to be seen in the context of being ruled by brutal dictator or brutal extremist religious regime. 

\&gt;  muslim-americans may be a small demographic &amp; the sanders campaign  was really fucking disingenuous towards them, but plenty of them were  attracted to his campaign for a reason

It's very good. 

It's my suggestion that when reading it, you try to put yourself in the shoes of the writer. When I do that I get insight into why something like WWII happened. 

I don't believe the Nazis were ""evil"" that's propaganda, rather, I believe they believed. Evil people are easy to deal with but people who believe they are right and the good guys are hard to deal with. 

Religious people are a great example of this. 

I used to go to the gym with a bunch of muslim guys from the mideast. I'm a psychotherapist and used to have a lot of muslim American inmates. I had a muslim serial killer, and learned all about the religion from reading the Koran and Hadiths. 

Muslim Americans are typically ex inmates and people who live in the ghetto. They like islam because it promotes violence and isn't ""white"" in their eyes, etc. 

So, I tend to view islam as a ""war religion"" designed to recruit negative people to serve rich people and justify very crude behavior. 

However, my actual muslim buddies from the gym were very sweet people. We used to have the best convos about the US, culture, etc. I could see that if one of them did something based on the commands of that religion, it would be done from ""the heart"". So, they might kill people because it's ""what mom would have wanted"" and because I'm a ""good guy"". 

This is much worse than the inmates I knew looking for an excuse to cause chaos. 

So, when reading the Nazi stuff think that these guys really meant it and thought they were right. For me, it's good knowledge about how to identify potential trouble on an individual and mass basis."
302,fkqvsh7,"Oh, wow- this thread got out of hand very quick. I should have made a much more robust argument to begin with, because I don’t think either of us really knew where we were coming from as a result of my offhand comment. 

I think I see where you’re getting at now. 


So I’d like to begin with a fairly uncontroversial statement- acts of violence or terror can be committed as a result of a variety of religious doctrines. [Here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168016646392) is where it must also be said that muslim-majority countries have much higher rates of violence. The question I think we should be preoccupied with answering, however, is why certain groups or religions spawn violence. An immediate answer that would seem to make sense is- well, the content of the religious doctrine. So let’s examine that to begin with and see how it holds up. 

For the sake of argument and simply because the thread has focused on it so much already, let’s talk about the doctrine of Christianity and Islam. 

Both the Bible and Quran promote violence to non-believers, to those who go against the doctrine, and to certain groups. They are quite similar in their promotions of violence. (There are some arguments that the Bible may be even more violent than the Quran, though those studies are fairly subjective or rely on computers to find key phrases, which could have a good amount of error. Regardless if one is slightly more or less so, they are highly comparable in ideas of violence and of peace, and it is exceedingly easy to use excerpts from each to promote violence towards groups.). Many religious texts share similar violent sentiments- so what’s going on here? What is the cause of violence, if not the raw text itself? I’d like to offer up an explanation. 

Impoverished and unstable parts of the world are inextricably linked with violence. Many muslim-majority countries are war-torn. The death toll in Muslim-majority countries is much higher than Christian-majority. There are many potential reasons for this- and some reasons why this idea alone is slightly misleading. 

It could be a result of colonialism- “What can account for the violence among Muslims? One obvious possibility is the history of colonialism with its legacy of artificial boundaries imposed by European colonial powers, an issue that has arisen explicitly in the numerous conflicts between Israel and its neighbors as well as in the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.”

It could be exacerbated by interventionist policies that do not function well in practice- “Another more recent source of problems is the interventionist policy of major powers, generally with a Christian majority, such as the Soviet Union in Afghanistan from 1979 and the US and other Western powers in several countries after 9/11. As a result, seemingly stable dictatorships have been replaced with unstable semi-democracies in a number of Muslim countries, such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya.” (This is not to say that democracy or intervention is bad, nor that dictatorships are good- simply that they cause high amounts of conflict and instability, which in turn leads to violence). 
A note of particular significance is that, although muslim countries are much more linked with violence, this statistic may be misleading in the sense that most violence is muslim-on-muslim. This is a civil war in many ways, and I think that’s relevant to the discussion because the prominent idea for the muslim ban is that muslims, if let into the US, will cause violence in the name of religon to non-muslims based on the war-torn state of many muslim-majority countries. This is a faulty conclusion to make. In the US, in fact, Pew research studies found that people following Islam are exceedingly similar in progressive thought to Americans of other religions- and sometimes even [moreso](https://www.niskanencenter.org/muslim-americans-are-more-likely-to-reject-violence-intolerance-than-many-americans/). 

Some potential food for thought here would be the relationship between immigration and violence- do immigrants and refugees increase it? A [meta-analysis](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092026) suggests likely no, and possibly even a reverse effect emerges, though how this effect happens isn’t fully understood yet. Please note that each study included in the meta-analysis came to many different results based on the huge variety in each community, area, or group. This is also not the be-all-end-all of this discussion- as the researchers themselves point out, there are possible flaws and further study is needed. Their conclusion, though, reads: “What is the average immigration-crime relationship across our sample of studies? Is it positive, negative, or null? Is it strong or weak? Overall, our narrative review reveals that the most common outcome reported in prior studies is a null or nonsignificant association between immigration and crime. Indeed, sixty-two percent of effect-size estimates reported in our sample are not statistically significant at the 0.05 level. At the same time, although statistically significant effect-size estimates are less common than null findings, it is noteworthy that the majority of the statistically significant results are negative, suggesting that greater immigration is associated with lower crime rates. In fact, our review indicates that significant negative effects are 2.5 times as common as significant positive effects.”

This will be the last reply I make, so I will leave it at this: 

You can rarely simplify violence down to a single prompt or event. Humans are naturally averse to violence and so the making of violence often requires prolonged exposure to it, mental illness, very extreme living situations- or any mix of the above plus a myriad of other potential causes. Islam itself cannot account for violence, and the denial of refugees from situations in which violence breeds does nothing to reduce it. A muslim ban is not a good or just solution. 

I wish you well, man."
303,fg7ar30,"Of course he is. Most Muslim Americans are in the US because they fleed war, occupation or imperialist-backed authoritarianism at home (usually a combination of the 3, see: Muslim Palestinians or Muslim Yemenis)

304,fb6984u,"Over 400000 Hindu pandits were killed or expelled from Kashmir by Pakistan backed jihadists. Also most of the violence in Kashmir is the result of jihadist Violence. The Gujarat riots happened after jihadist blew up a train full of Hindu pilgrims, also 1/4 of the riot casualties were Hindu.  Also in the Bangladesh war of 1971 anywhere between 300k and 3million Hindu Bengali’s were killed by the Pakistani military. Also 50-100 non Muslim girls are abducted in Pakistan every month. The Sikh riots occurred after a Sikh assassinated our prime minister, though that doesn’t justify it.When the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo made fun of Muhammad, Muslims started riots in Bangladesh that destroyed hundreds of Hindu homes and several temples with several Hindus killed and many raped. Also the Muslim rohinhya community in Burma that’s supposedly oppressed has been rounding up Hindu rohingya men in refugee camps and killing them while also forcing their wives to convert and marry them."
305,f0vhkyq,"&gt;This isn't the 'race war', you're probably not even Chinese. 


Lol.
You can't really call yourself a minority in the US if you're Dutch. You would be lumped in the white category. Just like how Chinese, Japanese would be lumped into the Asian category. 


I can tell when other races (especially in America) want to distinguish how different Japanese and Chinese are only when they want to make sure the Asian minority groups don't bind together and deliver 1 voice like...now.


You might be able to distinguish an American born Chinese/other Chinese from each other, so whoopie for you. Not everyone can do that and even if they're able to, it's after interacting/talking with them for a bit. You can't tell 100% of the time just by a brief glance. Just like how Muslim-Americans are discriminated against even though APPARENTLY trumpers only hate the Muslims coming from the Middle East.


And you claimed you've experienced crazy racism from Asian people in LA and then in a another response you said they've been polite as heck to you but treat others very bad. So you're a liar and a liar that can't even provide examples of others treated very bad."
306,eudrsmr,"9/11 unquestionably had an influence on attitudes both within the American Muslim community and without. But this just reinforces my point that American Muslims have moved leftward. The so-called War on Terror didn't just lead to some marriage of convenience with the Democratic Party. It may have been the original catalyst, but attitudes entirely unrelated to the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and the growth of the surveillance state have changed too. 

Do you think it's a coincidence that two of the most progressive members of Congress happen to be Muslim, or that Muslim and former DNC deputy chair Keith Ellison held firmly lefty views? No, it's the result of an upswell in progressive attitudes across the populace. You see it everywhere - not just in the halls of power, but in social media conversations between ordinary people online. 

For example, while you get conservative brozzers from the Middle East making the infamous Lollipop Analogy, you frequently see Muslim American hijabis criticising the argument in feminist terms, saying the analogy objectifies women and withdraws agency from men. It's the same with attitudes towards immigration - you'll sometimes hear Khaleejis complaining about refugees and illegal immigration in a fashion not all that dissimilar to European and American right-wingers. But since a lot of Muslim Americans are immigrants, that feeling does not take hold there. In fact, it's likely part of the reason why so many Latinx are converting to Islam - there's a sympathy that grows between groups facing similar issues that forms the foundation to deeper examinations of belief and practice. 

(These are generalisations, of course. There are plenty of progressive Middle Easterners and conservative Muslim Americans too. But these trends are absolutely true and reflected in the surveys I mentioned earlier.)"
307,ens1lv9,"&gt; That's why Pakistani officials got assassinated for protecting a woman who committed the heinous crime of drinking from the same source as a Muslim.

https://niskanencenter.org/blog/muslim-americans-are-more-likely-to-reject-violence-intolerance-than-many-americans/

Muslim Americans are the least likely group to advocate for violence. They also commit the least violent crimes. 

Also, I provided proof. I’d like evidence to your stories. 

&gt;And why Muslims under the oh so oppressive English gov't managed to get Birmingham schools to stop teaching LGBTQ lessons.

You mean parents don’t want sex taught to their 12 year old children? OH NO HOW OPPRESSIVE. Oh wait a second, you mean non Muslims have been doing the Same thing for decades in the same country, and it didn’t make international news until Muslims did it? 

It really makes you think, eh? Well, not you. You clearly refuse to think. But the rest of us. 

&gt;Somehow every aspect of this world changes over time, and yet religions don't? 

If the scriptures remain the same since the about 700-900s, but the practices only began in the 1800s, then clearly it’s an issue of environment, not religion. 

&gt;That kind of statement can only be made by someone that never took a middle school level history class.

Oh the irony. 

&gt;Even a cursory glance at European history would bring plenty of evidence to contradict that naive statement on the consistency of religion.

Hold up. You just proved me right! If Europeans can change from having the most religiously-bound governments in human history to being secular, and Christianity is not to blame for when the church ruled, then why is Islam blamed when the situation is flipped? 

Could it be that you are just pulling fallacies out of your ass to distract from the fact that you still haven’t provided scripture backing your claim?"
308,enor6qt,"I don't see how this has turned into reasons of religiosity on why he's a cunt.

* He has face tattoos (skin branding, tattooing is forbidden in Islam).
* Sex outside of marriage is a grave sin.
* Therefore sexual assault of a non-consenting minor is an even graver sin.
* No Good Muslim parents are telling their children that non-muslim girls are sluts nor any good religious leader.

I understand that you may dislike Muslims and that's partly due to the west's war on terror sparked by 9/11 but jeez, at least look into the religion, even a little bit before making sweeping generalizations and condemning over half a million of your compatriots."
309,eeaaiac,"from your own link:

&gt;But nowhere in the Quran does God command earthly authorities to execute anyone who has converted from Islam.

and then

&gt;Unlike the Quran, there are conflicting stories and opinions about the prophet’s stance on apostasy.

Hadith/Sunnah have for years had issues with authenticity and legitimacy, let alone the idea that the classical arabic word for apostasy was actually ""treason"".  There are also several hadith that tell stories of people leaving Islam without any consequence, as the articles you linked proved.

&gt;There's a reason why people who want to leave the religion have to flee in fear for their lives.

in how many countries?  go ahead and look it up.  Only 2 have the death penalty for it, Iran and Saudi Arabia.  Iran has not executed anyone for apostasy since 1990, and before that there was the horrors of the Iraq Iran war that makes it difficult to examine.  Saudi Arabia has 2 men on trial in the last 30 years for apostasy, sentenced to death, but not executed yet.

THere is political use of apostasy as a form of control, but it's not common, and not commonly used, and not commonly agreed upon by Muslims in general.  

&gt;No religion specifically says to kill people who leave, it's in the Quran, and I've provided a link for you, this is pretty common knowledge so I'm not sure why you'd think that it doesn't say that.

it's hilarious that you say that, as both links say ""It's not in the Quran"".

&gt;The US isn't a religion, and it doesn't intentionally seek out women and children to kill them, or people that don't believe in their religion.

You missed my point, and the US HAS ignored women and children in their campaigns.  there are always sociopaths who are willing to kill women and children for their own gain, Muslim or American or whatever.  YOu can't dismiss the ACTUAL killed by the US just because you want to pretend the US isn't religious.

&gt;Do you wonder why all Islamic states have been at war with each other since the beginning of the religion

Have they?  When Islam arose, there was the Pax Islamica, followed by the Pax Ottomana.  Even at the most contentious periods of the Muslim history, as I told you, the Muslim world has seen less conflicts than it has since before Islam.

ALSO, everyone on earth has been at war with someone since the dawn of history until the arrival of nukes.  Stop cherry picking facts.

&gt;Islam directly hinders progress, all other religions have been able to slowly adapt to the times except for Islam.

except for most of Islam's history where the opposite was true.  And even in the US , Muslims have the highest rates of pursuing higher education than any other group except for Jews.  they also more likely to reject violence as an answer to political situations than ANY group in the US, including Jews and Atheists.

And it is true that the Qur'an has extremely violent passages calling for the deaths of the Christians and the Jews.

Here are some examples:

\[Qur'an 2.191\]

""And kill them wherever you find them, and drive them out from whence they drove you  
out, and persecution is severer than slaughter, and do not fight with them at the  
Sacred Mosque until they fight with you in it, but if they do fight you, then slay  
them; such is the recompense of the unbelievers.""  
  

\[Qur'an 5:082 Set 23, Count 56\]

""...you will find the most violent of people in enmity for those who believe (to be)  
the Jews and those who are polytheists \[while they are converted to  
Islam on pain of death\]... 

&amp;#x200B;

 \[Qur'an 8:012  Set 28, Count 62\]

""...make firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who  
disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.""

&amp;#x200B;

 \[Qur'an 8:039-048 Set 30, Count 66-75\[8.39\] 

""...fight with them until there is no more persecution and religion should be only for Allah...""  
    
 \[Qur'an 8.65\] 

""O Prophet! urge the believers to war; if there are twenty patient ones of you  
they shall overcome two hundred, and if there are a hundred of you they shall  
overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they are a people who do  
not understand.""

 \[Qur'an 9:005 Set 33, Count 91\]

""...slay the idolaters wherever you find them...take them captives and besiege them  
and lie in wait for them in every ambush...""

\[Qur'an   9:029 Set 38, Count 101\]

""Fight those who do not believe in Allah...nor follow the religion of truth, out of  
those who have been given the Book, until they pay the tax in acknowledgment of  
superiority and they are in a state of subjection.""

313,ebkxapp,"Abstract:

&gt; Since 9/11, scholarly work has demonstrated that Muslim Americans are viewed unfavorably, but existing measures lack enough contextual specificity to capture the unique experiences and situation of Muslims in the United States. Given the central role that Muslims and the war on terror played in the 2016 presidential campaign and election, we fill this void by introducing a new measure that focuses on Muslim Americans, specifically, and then examine its role in explaining presidential vote choice in 2016. Across five distinct surveys fielded on convenience and nationally representative samples from May 2016 to June 2017, we find that anti–Muslim American sentiment is a strong and significant predictor of supporting Trump, even when controlling for a whole host of factors. Our measure of Muslim American sentiment also more strongly and consistently predicts support for Trump, relative to previous measures of anti-Muslim sentiment."
314,e8crg23,"That's because at the time the majority of those Muslim Americans were immigrants and came from professional backgrounds (Doctors, Engineers and Businessmen).

Coupled with the fact that Bush took a hardline against Israel.

But American born Muslims are far more likely to vote democratic.

Regardless though Muslim Americans are pretty 'woke'. They're not as loyal to parties as to policies.

For example the support for Bush dropped to 7%. Mainly because of the Iraq war. But also Muslims overwhelmingly support Obama but due to his actions in the middle east his support dropped from 89% to 68%."

Pop quiz, Greeney. FGM is outlawed in the US. Y'all got anything to say about that?

https://www.adl.org/resources/profiles/act-for-america

&gt;ACT’s legislative agenda traffics in paranoia that vilifies the American Muslim community. One of the group’s primary legislative goals is to restrict Muslims’ religious freedom by propagating the conspiracy theory that Muslim Americans are trying to impose Sharia Law in the United States. ACT demonstrates a weak understanding of Sharia law by attributing the brutal act of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) to the set of religious laws. In fact, FGM is neither mentioned nor religiously sanctioned in the Quran or Sharia law, and it is already federally outlawed in the United States. As part of their efforts to denigrate an entire religion, ACT members falsely portray this disturbing cultural practice as a religious practice.

I see. The only time you've even mentioned it, apparently, is when you claimed it had nothing to do with Islam. And that's a ""disturbing cultural practice"". But y'all actively defend MGM."
317,duftsug,"&gt; but they have the right to do khulu which is basically divorce under the condition to give the mahr back

Yes she can do khulu and renounce her mahr but in many circumstances her mahr is all she has. Today a lot of Muslim women receive the furniture of their home as mahr which under secular law she is entitled to half in the case of a divorce. Under khulu she would be renouncing something she has a right to. 

&gt; So my point is: i know that the husband has more rights then his wife but Islam doesnt make wifes suffer because they have the right to leave anytime

When talking about divorce it is very important to consider that many women do not leave abusive relationships when they have children bc they do not know if they can provide for their children and do not want their children to grow up without a father. Yes Islam may grant women some rights but thats not good enough. Its kind of like saying there's no issue with living under a horrible dictator like Sadam Hussein or Pol Pot bc people had some rights like under Sadam women were allowed to wear whatever they wanted. However, there are so many fundamental rights that they were denied under these dictatorships such as freedom of expression and other democratic rights. Likewise women do not have some of the most important rights like leaving the home freely and when women have less rights than men it has a massive impact on the entire society.

&gt; i meant the muslims here in europe who randomly rape european women and that many exmuslims say, that this is permissible which is not true.

Obviously not all the Muslim men fleeing to Europe are rapists and that nations around the world need to do their part in solving the refugee crisis. Rape may not be permissible but the culture that they are brought up in creates an atmosphere where these types of behaviours can be justified. Firstly, I have seen and heard of numerous occasions where young Muslim men have dated a non-Muslim girl for a time period before suddenly leaving her. I have actually mentioned two of these occasions before on this subreddit where on one occasion it happened to a co worker of mine that was dating a Muslim man and on another occasion it was a guy I knew that dated a non Muslim girl. In all these occasions, these men seek a relationship with the girl bc unlike with Muslim girls she has no issue with having pre-marital sex. In many of these occasions the man will lead her on, and some will even try to convert her, and when it becomes serious he will leave her bc she is not ur standard parent-pleasing, 5x-a-day praying, fasting, modest hijabi. The culture creates an environment where the women that are non-Muslims are seen as unworthy for marriage and unfit to be mothers and so the guy feels no remorse towards what he has done to the non-muslim woman bc he has satisfied his desire and in his mind she's slept with other men so she should be use to it. Likewise, although the overwhelming majority of Muslim men would not rape an innocent women when men are conditioned from a young age to view women through only 2 lenses - one where she is like a lollipop that still has its wrapper on and is clean and untouched and the other where the lollipop is uncovered and there are all ants crawling on it and its dirty - then these men start to see non-Muslim women in a lesser light and hence they have less remorse when their sexual tension takes over. 

&gt; you have to treat the slaves good. give them the same food and clothes as you and you dont have the right to beat them

This is where Islam meets a large contradiction. On one hand it says if you are not going to free your slaves bc you need them then you must treat them well and on the other hand it gives men the authority to sleep with their slaves. This largely problematic bc the line between having to obey your master and the point at which your master is abusing his/her power is not really clarified within Islam. If your master commands you to sleep with him and the Quran says its permissible are you then able to deny. No doubt masters do abuse their power, there's no such thing as good slavery. The whole economy of slavery is built upon the notion of free exploitation. Regardless slavery should have been outlawed by the so-called ""prophet of God"" bc naturally ppl will abuse their power. Consider today where slavery is no longer legal in Arab countries yet it is legal to have servants, usually imported from South Asia. There are many cases where these servants have been mistreated and abused by their so-called Muslim employers. Now imagine these weren't servants and they were slaves, they would be treated even worse. There is also the contradiction that Islam claims humans humans were born free and that they have agency yet it allows slavery - no where in any verse or hadith is there a statement that slavery is a business that should and slaves should oppose their masters. In addition the Prophet himself is a prime suspect of exploiting slaves. His marriages to both Safiyya and Mariah Al Qibtiyya are examples of the misogyny that is allowed within Islam. 

Safiyya was from 2 Jewish clans in Medina that were both massacred on seperate occasions bc they did not believe in the divinity of Muhammad. During this period her father was captured and executed by the Prophet (so much for the Prophet's mercy) and her husband was also killed. Not to mention she probably had many other members of her family killed. The survivors were then taken as prisoners of war and sold into slavery as was the custom of the time. According to Islam Saffiya converted and married Muhammed and consummated her marriage with him within three days. This is view taken by Islam is a load of tosh - a person who has had most of their family killed by someone does not in a period of 3 days all of a sudden fall in love with the man that executed their father along with other family and friends and have sex with that man. She was obviously coerced into converting and marrying him bc as a slave you don't really have much of an option and marrying the prophet and converting would mean she would no longer be a slave. According to the Sirah of the prophet, even the prophet's other wives were unsure of her loyalty and were worried she may avenge her family (bc that is he natural thing to do as a human). 

As for Mariah she was offered as a gift along with another Coptic girl as a gift from the ruler of Egypt. She was described as being immensely beautiful. The prophet then took her as his own wife and gave the other girl to a companion. If this prophet was truly an example to mankind he would not have accepted 2 slave girls as gifts, he would have set them free and not taken the prettier one as his own and it shows how slaves were exploited at the time. There was nothing to suggest Mariah wanted to become Muslim and was yearning to marry the prophet. When Muhammad is portrayed as the greatest human to walk the earth, millions of Muslim boys are named after him and is described as an example Muslims must follow, its no surprise the Muslim world is suffering from the rampant misogyny that is prevalent. The problems in the Muslim world are not exaggerated by most ex-Muslims, they are obvious and can be easily linked to the religion which creates the foundations from which these problems have come from       "
318,drq3an7,"I'm being semi-facetious; I'm well aware that many circumfetishists do know circumcision is harmful, but owing to the conflicting (to put it verly lightly) attitudes on it that exist internationally and the otherworldly legal grey area it involves, they're able to operate with impunity, and can exert a unique level of manipulation and plausible deniability with their lies. That's why Morris repeats claims as bald-faced insane as ""100 to 1"" and ""over half of all men"" (or can, in one paper- this one openly co-authored by the editor of the infamous circumfetishist site Circlist- [benignly describe circumcision styles that make the penis shorter.](https://i.imgur.com/oo5cg2W.jpg)) He's faced basically no chance of legal repercussions and seemingly no chance of academic sanctions, and for the position he's in with the topic of circumcision (though the fact he has no medical background likely also gives him some freedom- much less of a chance of malpractice accusations), he can say all he wants. A psychopath in a virtually untouchable position of power, or one unlikely to face any repercussions can be inclined to say all he want, and that's what we see with Morris. And the power he's been able to exert is one which involves sexually maiming people, mostly children, in one of the most fundamental, personal and ultimately permanent ways. Circumcision apologism/promotion is an obvious magnet for some incredible psychopaths, and the chances of repercussion are basically as minimal for a man like Morris as it is for an anonymous sadistic pedophile convincing parents to circumcise their children over the internet.

I'd argue that Morris' fanaticism and insanity [has actually helped turn Australians against circumcision](https://intactivistsofaustralasia.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/minority-reporter-how-brian-morris-fought-a-personal-war-against-the-human-foreskin-and-how-he-lost/). He's apparently been referred to as the most hated man in Australia at one point, and I'd imagine most Australians familiar with him think he's a deranged crank. You might ask why he's done so much damage to his own cause with his behavior, I think in addition to him simply being insane, he's been able to do enough- and it could also just be a game for him, and he clearly just gets off on claiming the things he does. His behavior hasn't stopped his work from being actively cited in AIDS research, used by the manufacturers of Circumplast, being endorsed by [Edgar J. Schoen](http://intactwiki.org/wiki/Edgar_J._Schoen), or recently [co-authoring a pro-circumcision paper with Douglas Diekama](http://circwatch.org/doug-diekema-and-brian-morris-join-forces-who-made-the-biggest-mistake/), a member of the AAP's 2012 circumcision Task Force.

Morris is likely just taunting people with his admission, and that's likely been part of his motive for liking blatant circumfetishist material on social media (that Circumsexual Pride page got hammered by Brother K and other intactivists following his like- it did nothing to deter him). Although it is certainly useful in arguing against circumcision proponents (especially those who'd cite him), it's unlikely to do much to hurt his reputation any time soon.

OTOH, it could be just a lapse, hence why I said ""semi-facetious""- Morris really could believe circumcision is not harmful, be conflicted over the possibility is, wants to believe it is etc. A psychopath having a lapse of admission/reason is really not unheard of.

One thing you can give Morris credit for, he knows not to say anything (openly) favorable about female circumcision, of which he's said basically nothing. But if [this email is accurate](http://intactwiki.org/wiki/Brian_J._Morris#Female_Circumcision), Brian Morris also believes female circumcision does not harm sexual functioning, and is open to the idea of it having ""health benefits."" If he came out about this though, his career would be destroyed for sure. And the fact it would take this, and not everything else known and documented about him is another testament to the grotesque international double standard on FGM and MGM.

Even his favored Circlist maintained for many years [a page that was favorable to female circumcision](http://archive.is/rqfR6); which they likely took down after finally realizing how this made them really look, and eventually [largely came out against the practice.](http://archive.is/FAe2f) Though they still [maintain a page that focuses primarily on voluntary female circumcision](http://archive.is/Nv9xy), they see nothing wrong with (involuntary) symbolic clitoral pricking, and seem favorable towards (involuntary) clitoral hood reduction:

&gt; These sober figures make nonsense of the pages and pages of hysterical writings claiming, in a mixture of anti-circumcision fervour and islamophobia, that Muslim girls are mutilated. At least half, probably more, either have nothing at all done to them or else receive a purely symbolic needle prick. Those that are operated on have their clitoral hood reduced, an operation that women in the West are queueing up to pay big dollars for. The latter group are the lucky ones, since their sex life will be greatly enhanced. (Just as it will be for their circumcised brothers). "
319,dr9rzl1,"&gt;I think you are still underestimating political Christianity, including and especially in Europe.

I'm not underestimating it, Russia is one classic example of using Christianity as a political tool. Even the head patriarch, Kiril, is intermixed with the business of politics. Maybe some other countries I can muster up, would be in the Balkans - Hungary seems to be another big nation, using Christianity as a political tool. Perhaps even Poland. 

&gt;So yeah, many people in many Christian dominant countries are not really aware of their Christian bias nor the fact that Christianity plays a major role in the politics of their countries. I think that at least in Muslim countries, they are somewhat more aware - depending on the country.

I think most the Arab countries are aware, there is and isn't a bias in Iran, and I would say in Turkey a good portion of people don't even know the Quran from a hole in the wall. The conservatives hear quotes from politicians, Imams and elsewhere and act as if they are experts in Islam. 

&gt;However the fear of people of Christian dominant countries of Islam is real and justified for them (destruction of our way of life, liberties, etc..).

This is partly the fault of the individuals in Christian dominating countries, who have alienated previous immigrants to their country. Turks immigrated to Germany in the older days, despite those Turks who have fully assimilated, speak the German language fluently, and act ""German"" in every possible way - they are still alienated and not accepted as being Germans. What does alienation produce? 

Contrast this behavior with the United States, where most individuals of Muslim background who assimilate; fit into American society and act ""American,"" they are considered to be American by their peers. Let's also examine the fact that Muslim Americans are mostly successful individuals, who earn higher incomes than the American average salary - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_States#Education_and_income , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_States#Integration , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_States#Islamophobia

Europe has failed to assimilate their migrants from Muslim regions, partly because they did not allow these migrants to fully assimilate in the first place (Turks in Germany for instance). 

&gt;Re the Shah I was referring to the father, not the son. He was contemporary to Ataturk and had the same plans - modernise and westernise Iran, just like Turkey - nationalism etc...

I honestly don't know much about Reza Shah, but I don't have good opinions of them from what I know. I know he wanted to align his nation with Nazi Germany (one of the excuses from changing Persia to Iran [Land of the Aryans]). 

&gt; Let's not forget that Erdogan's move away from the EU is not only based on the negative aspects of the EU, but it is deeply ideological (not unlike Putin's). 

Let's not forget the decades of toying with Turkey, even many politicians from Europe or retired politicians had claimed, ""We weren't going to admit Turkey into the EU anyways."" Turkey has a right to be wary and against prospects of the EU by the way they treated them.

&gt;and which has resulted in the rise of Islamism - eerily similar to what happened in Iran.

I don't think political Islam has a strong hold in Turkey, maybe you can call me biased, but I don't see it in the same level that Iran had. The Mullahs and the government always clashed with one another, the government tried to silence and suppress the power of the Mullahs for a long time. Iran has been dealing with progressiveness vs Islamism for quite some time. The Mullahs declared victory in 1979. 

Erdogan may be utilizing Islamist ideologies to appeal to a certain crowd of people, and use this ideology to differentiate himself from others - but this isn't the same thing I saw in Iran... Where actual clerics pushed for the Islamization of Iran, unlike Turkey - where a non-cleric named Erdogan is trying to separate his country from previous ideals. 

&gt;That is a failure of westernisation in both cases.

Turkey still has considerable support for their opposing parties, who stand for most the policies of Ataturk. I wouldn't call it a failure, they have failed to limit the power of Erdogan and they have failed by being too submissive. But these ideologies and support still exist, while in Iran it is dead.

&gt;You don't see people in Europe worshipping and ""following"" the dead leaders of the enlightenment movement - they follow and worship freedoms, liberties, democracy and ""western/European"" values. Anyway...

Not Europe as a whole, but I'm sure such behavior exists at least in one country. The Serbs idolize a lot of their war ""heroes,"" for instance.

&gt;where the underlying nations are destroyed to pave way for only one homogeneous nation

This is somewhat changing gears, but wouldn't you consider that as the same thing that occurred in Armenia with the expulsion of Muslim ethnic groups? 

&gt;(I think it's only Cyprus and Uruguay prior to 1991 - one is an obvious case and Uruguay is just an anomaly in my book)

It's obvious because Greeks and Armenians have close ties? I think it's somewhat hypocritical from Cypriots, let's not forget why their northern parts of their Island were invaded by the Republic of Turkey. They were ethnically cleansing Turks. 

I also don't know about Uruguay, just a thought, because of a mutual religion? I don't know, but I think quite a few things in this world can be traced to the topic of religion. 




 









"
320,dplsup2,"&gt;Is it really that hard to admit that the Democratic party is a lot more big-government than the Republican party?

I don't see that. On most day to day issues the Republicans are more big government, in my opinion.

Taxes - I'd consider this a wash. Sure the new Republican tax plan might help some people, but it's going to result in many others paying more due to the removal of the state income tax credit. Moreover I see Trump conservatives chomping at the bit for tariffs, which is just additional government tax on imports. If you think a 20% tariff (tax) on goods manufactured abroad like Trump suggested in the campaign isn't going to *severely* impact the average American, you are completely out of touch with the current consumption habits of the people conservatives are ""supposed"" to care about. 

Government Spending - Probably the left is worse here, but it's important to note ""defense"" (such a bullshit name) makes up 50% of discretionary spending, i.e. spending Congress can actually control, and Republicans keep pushing that through the roof. I wouldn't say either of the two major parties are ""small government"" in any real budgetary sense.

Social Issues - Christian Conservatives are huge moral busybodies that are more than happy to legislate other people into complete submission to their theocratic desires. Ted Cruz pushed for a ban on sex toys. Christian conservatives used to push for laws against sodomy. It's funny to see Christian conservatives rail against Islam so heavily considering they have near-identical views on many social issues. According to a [2015 Pew Research Survey,](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/11/03/u-s-public-becoming-less-religious/) both Christian and Muslim Americans are more likely than other Americans to affirm with complete certainty the existence of God and to pray every day. They are less likely to believe in evolution, less likely to believe that society benefits when women work outside the home and less likely to support same-sex marriage or abortion rights. In their religious devotion and attitudes toward gender and sexuality, American Muslims resemble evangelical Christians and traditional Catholics far more than they resemble secular members of any ideology.

Drugs - Clearly more big-government control from the Republicans here. The war on drugs is almost entirely a Republican created and perpetuated mess, and Sessions and Pence aren't going to do anything but make it much, much worse. Really makes America the ""land of the free"" when we lock up more of our population than any other nation on Earth, more than Stalin in his gulags, mostly for completely victimless crimes because Nixon and his conservatives successors decided ""drugs are going to ruin your life and we'll prove it by ruining your life if you use them.""

Police and Police Powers - Not hard to see where the loyalties lie here. Conservatives are far more likely to support increased power to the police; Trump himself said ""we have to give more power to the police"" during the campaign, signed an executive order making assault on an officer a [federal crime](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/9/14562518/trump-crime-police-orders), supports unlawful [civil asset forfeiture](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/19/politics/justice-department-paves-way-for-increased-asset-seizures/index.html) and [speaks in support](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/07/28/trumps-speech-encouraging-police-to-be-rough-annotated/?utm_term=.b83aaf0127da) of police abuse of suspects, encouraging police to be more ""rough"" and encouraged police officers not to be concerned about preventing physical harm to people being taken into custody. Meanwhile the left has groups like BLM, which despite choosing poor methods and optics have at least brought the issue of the widespread and endemic police abuse in America to the forefront of the news cycle.

Foreign Policy - Don't really think I need a comment here. Trump is a huge warhawk, as evidenced by his operations abroad that have killed American citizens (in [this](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/seal-american-girl-die-first-trump-era-u-s-military-n714346) case an 8 year old girl) and has generally done nothing but ramp up US interference in foreign countries, including increased [drone strikes](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-admin-ups-drone-strikes-tolerates-more-civilian-deaths-n733336), increased [civilian casualties](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-has-already-killed-more-civilians-obama-us-fight-against-isis-653564) and generally is acting like a complete big government neocon imperialist.

Regulation and Subsidies - I group these together because they're both efforts by the government to promote winners and losers in the economy. Regulatory cuts are nice, but *again* conservatives prove they don't practice what they preach by continuing huge subsidies to prop up the failing industries their voters work in. That's not anything close to ""free,"" it's crony capitalism just as much as government enforced monopolies are.

Conservatives are *not* for small government. I'm not saying liberals are either, but at least they're intellectually honest about it."
321,dm7i724,"&gt; I am in favour of tolerant multiculturalism and against French style lacite secularism because it doesn't work

Multiculturalism is even worse. Go see the UK and the numerous cases of Pakistani Muslim grooming gangs that mainly targeted white British girls. Proportionally speaking, as many British Muslims went to wage war for ISIS than French Muslims. Furthermore, though there are certainly a lot of tensions in France with the large Muslim population, polls have revealed that French Muslims are among the best integrated and most secularized Muslim communities in the Western world, notably when measured by acceptance of homosexuality. It's just that if the French system manages to integrate more Muslims than other systems, it also creates a hard rejection by a segment of the Muslim population, so French Muslims are a matter of extremes, well-integrated secular Muslims and extremist Muslims. The British multiculturalist system creates an unintegrated conservative Muslim population, which is also vulnerable to the siren song of radical Islam.

Canada's multiculturalism seems to work for a simple reason: Canada's geographic isolation from the Third World and very strict immigration policy results in only the most educated, most westernized, upper-middle class of developing countries having access to migration into Canada. The result is many people who favor multiculturalism incorrectly attribute Canada's rather successful integration of other cultures into a tolerant liberal mindset to multiculturalist policy, when in fact it's a mere result of cream-skimming from a particularly strict economic migration policy. Bring in the Muslim migrant population that France, Belgium, Germany or the UK have to deal with in Canada, primarily uneducated young man with a more conservative mindset, and we'd have the same problems, or quite likely even worse.

&gt;Despite the ""risks"" you see of tolerating religion in Canadian society, the fact is that 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants(with me being an example) are as religious and secular as the general population, and are becoming less so along with everyone else. 

A survey of Muslims in Canada actually showed that young Muslims are more religious than their parents, or at least give more importance to their religion than their parents. Young muslim girls are more likely to wear the veils than their mothers or grandmothers. It's a completely different evolution from every other ethnocultural community in Canada, which are growing less religious.

The sad reality is that Islam has proven extremely resistant to secularism and integration, no matter what policy the host society adopts. No other religion has this many problems with it."

Read this. Muslims overwhelmingly voted Republican in 2000. Some even thought it was not in the best interest of Muslims to participate in secular democracy. That's an extremely conservative position. There was a massive exodus in 2004, but that was because of the War on Terror, not for any socially or fiscally liberal positions. 2000 is the best metric for Muslim voting attitudes because there was no dominating issue like the wars. I'm a political scientist, and I have studied Muslim-American voting patterns. When polled individually on specific issues, you will find more conservative-minded Muslims. 

Anecdotally-speaking, most uncles that I know through my dad voted for Hillary Clinton, including my dad, but when they discuss individual issues, they are very much conservative. How many older people do you know that think abortion is okay, gay marriage is okay, more taxes are good, etc...? 

Young Muslim Americans are significantly more liberal. "
323,dlphcul,"You can't because of your bad law. Plenty of other, more progressive civilised countries would and DO. There's no irony in me saying they shouldn't be allowed to promote their message. Do you think a member of Isis should be allowed to stand in the centre of an American town and call for the deaths of all non-Muslim Americans? Are you saying you'd come down on the side of Isis if they wanted to stand on a war memorial, with rifles and other weapons, and yell about how they want to kill you and your other Americans?

I'm not sure anywhere I said ""eliminate nazis"". If someone is or wants to be a Nazi, then that's what they'll be. Eliminating the legitimisation of hatred isn't the bad thing you appear to be painting it as. I'm well aware that your ""right to free speech"" allows them to do this, as it would, in theory, allow Isis to stand with weapons in America and call for death to American citizens.

That is why most countries allow citizens the right to free speech, but hate speech is considered a hate crime. Just because your shitty amendment ALLOWS it, doesn't mean it's what's RIGHT. The insistence that they're allowed to continually commit hate crimes in public is what gives rise to these groups."
324,dk7uuit,"That meme poll is thrown around reddit so much, it's so obvious it's the top link at anti-Muslim sites.

the poll was shown to be flawed, especially if you use it gauge the entire 1.5~ Muslims on earth.  Rural Egyptians being asked ""do you think religious law is the best?"" does not reflect anything.  Egypt has it's own issues, and many of them revolve around Islam, yes.  But Egypt reflects only Egypt.  A farmer in Egypt's opinion doesn't matter to me here in the US.

Compare that poll to these polls done of Muslim Americans (there are more Muslims in the US than some Muslim countries, and these patterns of ""western"" Muslims reflect non-immigrant European Muslims as well).

Actually, if you look at Egypt's history, there is plenty of stupid shit Egyptians have done that have been detrimental to Muslims.  They assassinated the 3rd Caliph of the Rashidun period in early Islam, creating a political atmosphere that almost triggered a civil war that would've had multiple sides, which put political pressure on Ali Ibn Talib to take the Caliphate that he saw as being corrupted.

The Islamic university there establishes religious scholars from each region (for example, they say ""bob from Baghdad is in charge of religious interpretations for Iraq), right?  But when it comes to European and North American nations, they appoint scholars from the middle east (usually Egyptian, usually through nepotism) to dictate what rulings they need.  They are mostly ignored, since there isn't really a hierarchy in Islam, and each individual Muslim can simply refer to the quran him/herself.  but my point is Egyptians have tons of issues with they way their social and traditional systems handle Islam.  

&gt;I'd love to see these ""giant communites"" of women successfuly escape their religion in any country where sharia dominates. 

You're saying you'd love to see a community where the law doesn't use religion to impose control over it's population not follow the law?  You want a rebellion, basically?  And if there isn't one, it doesn't count?

Keep in mind that most states with Islamic laws are ones backed and established by NATO states.  Saudi Arabia, the Taliban, Pakistan, most Gulf states, ect.  If they don't have Islamic laws, they have military dictators, like Saddam or Egypt.

Actually, the Arab Spring in Egypt was massively all about secular democracy.  Even though religious political factions were elected (religious people have a right to democracy just like anyone else), the system established was still secular.  But then the US backed the Egyptian Military when they deleted all the Democracy and re-established their own dictatorship.

Stop trying to boil everything down to simple phrases.  Sharia law is complex and varies depending on time and place, and current events and politicians, again, do not choose what Islam is.  The same way America went to war in the name of peace, politicians gonna politic.  The fact that you keep using Sharia as a term, when Sharia literally translates to ""Law"" in Arabic.

So yes, ask someone ""Do you believe in law?"" and they say yes, don't be very surprised.  "
325,dj14w78,"IT had all been the same as before.

Gunshots rang out, blood billowed below on the solemn floor, and a mourning mother in the morning to the night banging on my door; asking, no begging, to know why her son had to die.

The sword drove between the flesh, as the bullet does know, almost silent as solitude took his body over. Yet, I still could not feel death. His death? Yes, but my own, no, never, at least at the hands of another. That's what we expect, until that sword itself drives into our flesh, like a car into a young boy playing in the street.

My war was never on the battlefield that was lost long ago. War will always have a scar on the homefront that those who declare it can never truly feel, as their bones crisp to the satiating need for power or resolve. 

War has always been this way, gutting societies like fishes in an ever-flowing river, until it exhausts. War will never change, it just never changes. No matter how many broken cries go out into what should be a silent night, filled with the flame and shot of all eras, from the bone-brushing ceaseless club to the brazen bullet of a soon to be a bygone era. 

Peace is the cry of all the voices into the night. Remember this next time you watch the evening news and another bunch of Arab boys are blown up by a MOAB or drone, and cheers ring out,""They are dead! They are dead! Freedom is saved""! But never forget the mothers no more, as another batch of young impressionable men is brought into ultimate solitude and the hellfire that should be a precluded prelude to the Olam Ha-Ba.

Why do we fight? We still scream. Yet we let it happen all around us. Every year, every day, another person died, and all of you let it happen! This you must know."
326,diz2e91,"I am definitely anxious about American women wearing niqab, by American I mean those who speak English really well. I think that may elude to them actually having fundamentalist believes. I've seen some niqab (only eye ) girls at big universities and I will never understand why they wear it, especially when hundreds of other Muslim girls are ok with hijab.

On the other hand, I'm not as concerned about the Arabs that come for medical treatment or Iraqi immigrants from the war, it's just part of their culture. Especially the older immigrants, but it's still creepy when they are shopping in full niqab. "
327,dirp719,"&gt; Why, then, is the very idea of sharia so consistently vilified in our country? Why is it used as a culture-war punching bag, such as in the March Against Sharia being staged this Saturday?

&gt; Let’s be clear: America could never have state-sanctioned religious courts. The First Amendment, which prevents government establishment of religion, forbids it.

&gt; But Islamic law can and does already operate in America under state sanction. When Muslim Americans are married according to Islamic law by a state-certified officiant of Muslim marriages, and receive in the process a civil certificate of marriage, they have, in effect, practiced Islamic law under official U.S. sanction.

&gt; Would the anti-sharia agitators keep Muslim Americans from marrying? Would they keep them from praying, distributing charity, fasting during Ramadan? For Muslim Americans already do all these things at the command of their law.

&gt; Sharia is not about amputations and stoning. These extreme punishments carry over from earlier, biblical law, and such sayings of Jesus as, “If your right hand sins, cut it off” (Matthew 5:30). 

[...] 

&gt; At the command of the Prophet Muhammad, Muslims the world over obey the law of the land they inhabit, whether that is Egypt, Israel or the United States.

&gt; Contrary to the right-wing caricature, sharia does not presume to replace American law. It agrees with its underlying values and promotes them.

330,fpkz1da,"So... Muslim Americans are an 'insignificant' vote, but those who support Israeli annexation are a key demographic Biden should be chasing?

Wow, no words.

That aside, under that framework you are suggesting, how is pushing any policy change advantageous during an election? Or any policy, for that matter?

Staying low key and not making any policy commitments might not make you enemies, but it's not going to inspire anyone to vote for you either. You're essentially asking that a politician be as feckless and under-the-radar as possible, with the hope that they just glide into office without upsetting anyone. And assuming they get into office... Politics just don't stop after the election. If you weren't going to voice support for a policy during a vote in fear of making enemies, you probably won't do it after either for the same reason.

Again, Biden won't win anyone over from the Pro-Israeli annexation camp, even if tomorrow he chastised Tommy for being a Hamas apologist. But the 'insignificant' votes that went to Tlaib or Omar are Democratic voters. Chasing the right as the expense of the left is only the kind of thinking that a Republican would have."

Instead, they only allowed idolators to avoid death by choosing to convert to Islam.**[46] Of the four schools of Islamic law, the Hanafi and Maliki schools allow polytheists to be granted dhimmi status except Arab polytheists. **However, the Shafi'i and Hanbali schools only consider Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians to be eligible to belong to the Dhimmi category.[47]**

No one is buying your bullshit Islamic lies. Forced conversions and cultural heritage destruction is rife in the history of Islam.

Even some more cases here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_conversion_to_Islam_in_Pakistan

&gt;Every year, about 1,000 non-Muslim girls are forcibly converted to Islam in Pakistan.[4] The Human Rights Council of Pakistan has reported that cases of forced conversion are increasing.[5][6] According to the Pakistan Hindu Council, forced religious conversions are one of the main reasons for migration of Hindus from Pakistan to India.[7]"

So I am not concerned about extremist Muslim immigration (I'm far more concerned about immigration numbers rather than Muslims in particular). If you don't want your daughter to be a thot, don't immigrate to the west, especially not Canada.

I dated an Indian girl (Hindu not Muslim though. But Muslim girls are thots here too). She had lived in Canada for 2 years when I met her. She arrived in Canada on a student visa. We had sex on the first date. I got the impression that this was a relationship because she started acting like my girlfriend and she didn't want me to see other girls. I agreed. Deeper into our relationship she was talking about wanting to get married by next year, wanting kids. She got a temporary visa after she finished school. I'm assuming she wanted to get married so that she could have permanent landed immigrant status in Canada and have a pathway to citizenship in 5 years or however long it is. But then I noticed signs of likely infidelity on her part. She had some sexy photos on her Whatsapp. And had a sexy bikini photo of her in her phone wallpaper. Meanwhile she was very possessive and didn't want me to interact with other women. I broke it off with her.

These brown women from traditional cultures come here to Toronto and turn into thots man. Toronto is literal cancer. I don't think Islam is ideal. And honor killings shouldn't be allowed. But I kind of understand the Islamic point of view. I was raised Catholic. My mom was a wholesome Catholic woman. Women get corrupted by our modern feminist culture. I gave serious thought to immigrating to the Philippines and getting a good wholesome Catholic Filipina wife. But even the Philippines is getting corrupted by western feminist decadence. I consider myself left of center. But I'm red-pilled about thottery and reject the feminist decadence coming from the modern left. The far-left calls me far-right and nationalist even though I've dated women outside my race and fine with the idea of marrying and having kids with non-white women. It's amusing."

You can say that you'll work hard in service of your family without suggesting what you would expect your partner to do. It would not be sexist to do this, it would only be sexist to expect your partner to always work less than you. However, as has become clear, you only want to get someone to go out with you, and are willing to change your facade in order to achieve this, using the study to come to the conclusion that you should be sexist. However, the conclusion was actually that you should be nice, rather than sexist. The two are not mutually exclusive. You earlier said that you weren't a niceguy, but can you see how presenting yourself as sexist because you think that this is what women want is very reminiscent of it? Again, I'm not saying that you are, just that it would be good to avoid that.

343,ejva5xr,"Well, sometimes girls of different religions can be a good thing if you can bring them to Christ. For example, many Muslim girls are only Muslim because of their culture, not because they've sat down and really believe that God could have no son. I met a girl from Iran before and as soon as I explained to her more and more of the scripture she understood it. She said that no one ever told her any of that in that kind of way. She didn't understand how God could have a son because no one ever explained it to her. 

I have seen Hindu's become Christians as well. BTW, you should pray for India as radical Hindu's are persecuting Christians badly right now. They even put their videos of doing it on YouTube. Also India has already adopted the RFID chip system to buy and sell. 

It will depend on what kind of Hindu she is as far as how her family reacts or herself. Explain to her Christ and why Christ comes first, explain to her that Christ is not a culture thing for you, it's a relationship,  if in fact it is a relationship for you, and then tell her the Gospel. Ask her opinion on it and if she thinks it makes sense. If she says yes BUT then says, here is what the Hindu's say about that, you should have an answer as to what you believe. 

Jesus is not one of MANY gods. He is the only way and that's it. 

She may have never rejected the Lord before. As I said, some girls are a certain religion due to culture. Even if they have rejected a religion in their culture, they may have not rejected the spirit of Christ himself. How can they reject it if they have never come in contact with it? 

She needs to come in contact with someone that has the spirit of Christ, not someone who is Christian because of culture or just finds themselves grown up in a Christian family. Someone with the spirit. Because people of other faiths can see it. If you have the spirit of Christ in you, let her see this. 

If you feel you have strayed from God too much lately and you are on your way to getting back, you may want to introduce her to an elder or even show her someone on YouTube such as Paul Washer, watch a sermon of his together with her, not a sermon on anything for people who have been Christians a while but the Gospel.

I’ve also had firsthand experience with the radical types who see me as nothing more than a nonbeliever. I’m sorry but I will never defend people who work actively against integration and denounce democracy and western values, while at the same time getting the benefits and healthcare. When an imam calls for a jihadi invasion of Europe (happened yesterday in a mosque in Copenhagen, not far from where I live), you cannot expect me to defend his “freedom” to preach shit like that. Some imams and elders have an iron grip on their communities and tell people not to vote, or become friend with Danes etc. I will never defend their rights, and I expect the same from them. They are intolerant, it’s not a prejudice, it’s a fucking fact. Jews or openly gay people cannot walk in that area without abuse.

350,dh42lrt,"My own opinion before I get into facts: America is taking in the educated Muslim from the Arab region, since everyones dream from the east is America. That leaves Europe picking up scraps, meaning lower class, barely educated Muslims. I can back this up by the fact that Muslim Americans are very much better off than European Muslims economically.

Because the 9/11 mentality severely affected the American population, much more than in Europe.
Muslims living in the US fear the US government after the way even alleged radicals were treated. Any hint of a fundamentalist ideology is quickly rejected in the American Muslim community.

This completely contrasts the way British and other European Muslims who have a fundamentalist/radical ideology act, who are much more likely to spread their ideas because their governments don't react the same way that the US does. Think about if someone like Anjem Choudary (A hateful preacher who freely preached for years) existed in the US - they would be arrested immediately. Or the fact that ISIS supporters are on the streets of London. There is no way that the US would ever allow anything like that to occur (even if it was just harmless protesting).
American muslims are almost always much more well off economically, which leads to more secular and liberal views compared to Europeans.

America’s Muslims differ from Europe’s in both quantity and origin. The census does not ask about faith, but estimates put the number of Muslims in the country at around 1% of the population, compared with 4.5% in Britain and 5% in Germany. Moreover, American Islam is not dominated by a single sect or ethnicity. When the Pew Research Centre last tried to count, in 2011, it found Muslims from 77 countries in America. Most western European countries, by contrast, have one or two dominant groups—Algerians in France, Moroccans and Turks in Holland."" (Muslims from Africa still tend to be economically struggling.)

Experts say that the conditions of Muslims in some European countries can create fertile breeding grounds for extremism, whereas societies with more-integrated Muslim populations like the United States are less susceptible.
“In Europe, pockets of Muslims are isolated by country of origin, which hampers integration. That keeps Islamic identity tied to a home country and so the community is more insular. The umbilical cord is still there,” says Shahed Amanullah, who has worked as a senior adviser at the U.S. Department of State

""Part of that lag can be attributed to the types of Muslim immigrants that have settled in the U.S. versus those who've settled in Europe. Many Muslims came to the United States after the Imigration Act of 1965, and included highly skilled and educated workers. The Muslims migrating to Europe, however, have tended to be economic migrants who labored in factories or came as guest workers.”

“ It’s not the influx of Muslims; rather, it’s Europe’s inability to welcome and assimilate immigrants. The resulting racial tension creates a perfect recipe for ISIS recruitment among disenfranchised young men. America is doing it right, and we cannot repeat the European model.”

“most telling of their loyalty and sense of inclusion, according to the Pew report, is that half of all Muslim immigrants display the US flag at home, in the office, or on their car.[6] It is this sense of inclusion that in large parts contributes to the fact that only an estimated 250 Americans have joined ISIS – a number far less than the number of Belgium citizens who have gone to Syria and Iraq.”

“Officials believe that over 5,000 Western Europeans have made their way to Syria to support ISIS. However, the actual number is considerably higher according to the Soufan Group, with several European countries contributing a disturbing number of fighters to ISIS: France (1700), Russia (2400), UK (760) and Belgium (470)[1]. For a country like Belgium with only 11 million citizens, having almost 500 citizens join ISIS is a shockingly high number. Furthermore, large pockets of Muslims are concentrated in cities like Brussels where more than a quarter of Belgium’s Muslim population resides. These heavily concentrated Muslim enclaves.”

That's pretty much like a little tiny colony of muslims within your country, no one goes in or out, and they live amongst themselves with their own little culture."
351,fvz6v0g,"In Pakistan, most of the people are Muslims so we have certain rules we have to follow and one of them is not dancing or singing. Its prohibited but of course people do it and Tiktok has been a major thing in promoting them cuz even men are doing those cringey and western dances so people really hate it here. And girls do it but the thing is Muslim girls are supposed to keep their ""cover"" and girls on tiktok DO NOT  follow the rules so........"
352,fte4ppf,"Yah latinos tend to do better from what I saw. Most cause a lot of them can be light skinned. I don't think dark skinned latinos get much love tho. Every latino I have seen with a white girl has been light skinned (or light brown).

Black guys were in 2 groups. The average ones were alone, but the tall and fit ones just had a lot of sex but no relationships.

one thing I was surprised by was that muslim girls are pretty loyal to muslim guys especially Pakistani girls. Correct me if I am wrong but Pakistani girls tend to stick to Pakistani men more than indian girls stick to indian men. Even just hanging out, I see Pakistani girls hang around Pakistani men while indian girls will try to hang out with other indian girls and non-indian men.

Before I didn't see asian guys with many girls but lately I have been seeing average asian guys with girls above their leagues. Idk if it has to do with the rise of China so asian guys aren't seen as weak anymore or what but yah I have def seen asian guys get higher quality girls lately. But this has been very recent since 2 or so years.
Among the asian guys I have seen Japanese dudes do the best (and maybe Viet). I think cause girls have the image that Japan is nice and modern.

Thats why I think the rise of India is very important because subconsciously when you tell them that you are indian, girls will associate you with India. And if India is poor and dirty and a hell hole then they will already not have a good vibe about you but if India is seen as developed, advanced and powerful then obviously they are gonna have a good vibe about you which will make it easier to get girls.

I think the main issue is that indian guys have this image that they are aggressive and conservative due to how the world sees India. White media promoting every rape that happens in India overtime can have a pretty big effect on the image of the indian group (while they suppress rape news about whites).

The only main solution I see is when India becomes stronger. Personality and individual things matter but so does the group you belong to. There are tons of white douches but because white men as a group are seen in a good light, women can see past the personality deficiencies because they are part of this exceptional group of men. A more powerful india will definitely boost the image of indian men and make it easier for them to get girls, even the average ones that would have remained single.

unfortunately I know too many abcds that hate india more than whites do and don't want to see it improve or don't care to while not realizing how much it would help them.

Idk correct me if im wrong."

And honestly, this is a thing I only see in Muslim men. The thing is nothing in the religion even says that this should be the way the house runs, but somehow it's been misconstrued. I hate it so much."

361,fdysewo,"&gt; Do you have any thoughts to share?

A few.

&gt;  But over the years he has brought up his wife wearing a hijab several times and **he seems to think that it's her decision to wear it.**

Because it is. Literally part of our faith, as I stated above: The woman is the one who chooses to wear it. Nobody else. 

&gt;   Which I feel sorta weird about. I want to respect everyone's autonomy, but I also have to wonder if it's a garment that's only worn as a tool of oppression, even if people are ""choosing"" the oppression. For instance, **if his wife didn't wear the hijab, his family would think she was a harlot.** And even if they didn't, members of their mosque would. And even if they didn't, other Muslims they encounter in daily life would. And he doesn't have a little girl yet, but if he did, and even if the hijab were her choice... Would it really be her choice?

You know literally none of this. I've never worn a hijab and about 50-60% of my female Muslim friends don't. They aren't considered 'harlots.' FFS. If you want to make such broad statements, learn a tiny bit about the religion and don't make assumptions like this.

&gt; I hope my comments don't offend. First and foremost, I respect the autonomy of others, and **I mind my own business.**

....

&gt;  I definitely don't tell others how to live their lives. But I have always wondered how much of a choice that really is. Do you have any thoughts to share?

So here's the thing. In the US, right now, it would be strange for me to walk outside bare chested. Perfectly legal, and within my rights. I mean, why not? I like my body just fine. But I like to keep those for myself and for my wife.  They are special and it makes me happy to be able to share my body with one person alone, just for us, and to buy pretty lingerie only 2 people in the world ever see.  
Women taking hijab or wearing modest dress feel this way about their bodies. *It's theirs.* It is just for them and their partner, if they have one.   Honestly, I get it. I hate being stared at by men and dress pretty modestly in terms of lengths/avoiding fitted clothing because I don't like being catcalled. It's very freeing to not worry about leers on the subway.  
I have a feeling many women of any/no religion understand that position as well. Avoiding the male gaze when it is unwanted is NICE. It's nice to not show off any extra weight gained or lost, and avoiding any comments another woman might make about your body as well.  My mom (and many other Muslim women) don't even shave their legs or underarms, either. It's not considered socially unacceptable, as far as their loving husbands are concerned.  Is shaving your legs and arms so you can wear a dress in public without getting shamed empowering? I would love to feel like I could do that with confidence. 

It's also communicating who you are as a cultural group as well as religion, and another person wearing a hijab or a Muslim man sees you and you are part of that group.

On a more lighthearted note, some are just lazy as all hell and have the worst looking hair under all that. They take them off at home and I'm like, *girl.* Wash that shit. A lot of muslim girls are people of various Asian and African hair types, that is not easy to deal with. 

TL, DR: There's so many reasons you are choosing to ignore. 

Don't put your own assumptions on to someone else. You do not know why someone is wearing a hijab. It's also none of your business.

362,f16cs6s,"If the supposedly muslim girls are not covering their hair, this does not count.

365,evue7vs,"Of course I’m sure non-Hindu girls suffer in India, they are minorities. Where do minorities not suffer? To say otherwise is delusional and completely unrealistic. Also, there have been a few people in India who have gone above and beyond just because they hate Muslims so they’ll even rape and kill these Muslim girls... just like in Asifa Bano’s case. Luckily, the perpetrators weren’t let off just because they were Hindus and cops, and just because the victim was a Muslim girl. A very recent incident just happened as well right now with a 3 year old, who was gang-raped and beheaded by two men. I believe she was a Muslim too because of her name. 

The only good thing about these crimes with Muslim girls happening in India though is that it doesn’t happen in such large numbers. Every time there has been an incident involving a young Muslim victim (especially girls), there have been protests in support of the victim, the perpetrators were brought to justice, media attention (even outside of India), etc. The Asifa Bano case, however, there were also protests in support of the rapists, but still the rapists were brought to justice. No one “won” on both sides considering Asifa Bano is still dead and the rapists were put in jail, but that is a few less rapists on the street. 

The thing about in Pakistan though is that these larger number of non-Muslim girls are often kidnapped, forcibly converted and forced to marry older Muslim men. Along with that, it gets no media attention, so that means more and more victims. Plus, these girls end up being victims not only because these people may or may not hate non-Muslims but because they want to increase the Muslim population. 

The Muslim population in India is flourishing and there is no massive rape/kidnapping/forced conversion or marriage happening in India with Muslim girls unlike with religious minority girls in Pakistan. 

The main difference here is that one happens at a lower rate, gets media attention/outrage and justice gets served (Muslims in India) while for the other it is, majority of the times, the complete opposite (non-Muslims in Pakistan). Only now it is getting at least very little attention because people like me call it out, but barely enough to make a difference. 

My “whataboutism” isn’t a problem because what I, and a bunch of others like me, think clearly makes no difference. If you were to do “whataboutism” that’s a problem because non-Muslims, in general, have been victims under Islamic rule and law today and for centuries. It’s a problem within Islam that needs to be addressed because it STILL happens today."
366,ew3fifi,"&gt; white men are less misogynistic than men of other ethnic groups.
&gt; 
&gt; To say they’re the same may sound nice and polite if you care about the feelings of males of colour but it doesn’t do anything to help women of colour. 

I'm really wary of conclusions like this, and it seems to me that blanket statements such as white men are less misogynistic than males of colour seems quite overtly racist, almost the very definition of racism in fact, whether or not you care about the feelings of men of colour or not - and I don't think it's actually helpful to either white women or women of colour to propogate that view. Let me explain why. 

I'm categorically not one to defend Islam. I agree with you that I think the religion is misogynstic so I will not be making any apologies for Islam. I agree that for many, the main goal is to convert others, proselytize and that there are very specific forms of misogyny in Islam which are backed up by the force of law whether that is in Muslim majority countries, or in Shariah courts in the UK.
Where I disagree is the jump from that to saying this means white men are better than men from other ethnic groups, sigh. 

First of all the conflation between race and religion there is evident but second and more importantly, just because some white men don't use religion to justify their misogyny any more, it doesn't make them any less misogynistic and I do think propogating that view is harmful - when I left Islam, I mistakenly did think that white men were less misogynystic and all it did was make me vulnerable to older white men who ranted about how disgusting the hijab was, while at the same time trying to groom and pressure me (a very young, vulnerable teenager then) to sleep with them for provisions, who groomed me to the normalisation of porn culture and prostitution as just an acceptable part of life rather  than violence towards, and exploitation of women and girls. It's true Muslim girls are 'groomed' into the hijab and modesty culture but in the wider culture around us in the West (which is predominantly made up of white people) we are collectively groomed into accepting porn and prostitution and rape culture. 

That's notable, because what Islam and Muslim men does is it tells girls like me that Islam protects *us* from *that* kind of misogyny by banning porn and prostitution etc. It's notable that men in both communities can never see their own misogyny but use it to basically say 'we're better than that group.'  Their own misogyny is so normalised, it feels like 'liberation' to them but they can see  the misogyny in the other group. As the girl in that scenario, I learned to be wary of both and I can't say that the misogyny of white men was any 'better' than that of Muslim or non white men. It's funny because I also worked and volunteered at various women's shelters, and I would come across so many women fleeing violence from white men who were perfectly content to rage against Islam because of how misogynsitic it is and then coming home only to get drunk  and beat their wives and girlfriends, sometimes almost to death. I mean hell, incel culture seems very heavily dominating by white men who hate women and think women literally owe them sex, and they have backed this up with killing sprees. I wouldn't say that is any 'better' than Islamic misogyny. In Amercia, people voted in a President who boasts about grabbing women by the p*ssy (which is sexual assault) and has the most vile views about women, I wouldn't say that this is insignificant therefore, or that it's any 'better' than Islamic misogyny or misogyny from non white men.  

On top of that, remember that Western societies were overtly of similar misogynstic viewpoints until relatively recently, and views like that don't just go away. For example, marital rape was legal in the UK until 1991, all white judges have said on the record that it's understandable for a father to rape his own stepdaughter because his wife was pregnant and he wasn't getting laid. This year, in the UK, a white judge made a claim that there is no greater right than that of a man to have sex with his wife. Child marriages are still legal in some Christian countries because of this kind of misogyny. 

The difference is that Western countries have had the peace and economic stability to push for human rights legislation, to remove the hold of religion over lawmaking to a large extent, and to challenge misogyny but I don't take this for granted, ever. I believe there is a large subset of people - white and non white - who are and do push to roll those freedoms back and all women - white and non white - need to be wary of that. The difference is that there are specific forms of misogyny in Islam which are still being upheld and practiced in the West, yes, and I think the left in the UK has treated this with leniency because of the bigotry of lower expectations - whilst we were pushing back against misogyny and rape culture in the law, we allowed religious courts including Shariah courts  without much oversight or regulation - when we should have been pushing for the notion that *all* women and girls have the same rights under the law and that Islamic family law practices are incompatible."
367,evkw7k2,"&gt; They invariably live in the West, where the stranglehold of Islam's dominance is weakened and they suffer little to no punishment for airing their non-orthodox views. 

Where the hell do you think Christian reformation came from? There's a reason the liberal west is where Christian progressivism took root. I hate to break this to you, but Christians living in the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia are still *way* behind culturally. It makes no sense to hold this against liberal Muslims as if it's somehow unique. What it actually proves is the broader liberal culture can influence both religions in similar ways. For example, Muslim Americans are more progressive than White Evangelicals."
368,ercsbz2,"Big picture and little picture:
The camp is strictly Muslim - girls are not allowed out unattended, no woman would ever be seen with a man who is not a close relative, etc.  It makes it much harder to have sex outside of marriage and limits the spread of AIDS.  It doesn't mean they're any more or less ""virtuous"", just that the consequences of messing around (for the woman, at least) is honor death.
Big picture:  south of the Sahara the stats for HIV are much higher.  Christian Africa is quite promiscuous (I hate the negative connotations) - I think they're wonderfully fun and sexy, but STDs are a consequence.  Truck drivers were/are a huge part of the issue- their routes were the original superhighways for the virus.  I spent a lot of time hitchhiking and I can see why that's the case."
369,ep47t3k,"&gt;Do you guys hate all the Muslims in India? I mean are you guys friends with a Muslim guy atleast? 

No. Yes, we have muslim friends.

&gt;Also The hatred towards the south Indians because they have not voted for BJP is on the rise. Do you think that South India is pro Christian or Pro Muslim? I don't think so. BJP lost in South India because they have incompetent leaders in the south. There are no star candidates like Smriti Irani or Narendra Modi. The local leader here like H.Raja have made blatant statements like Muslim girls are cheating in the exams because of that Burka. The mainstream media is controlled by the Anti BJP parties and a common man can't think about a National party, instead chose the same old Dravidian party which has been in power for many years. In Kerala it's different. BJP is seen as communal and anti-communist. The movies here in Kerala portrays very well about Communism. So in order to enter Tamilnadu and Kerala, the BJP has to ensure that the local leaders are secular,genuine and adherent to local culture. 

the hate isn't directed because they didn't vote for modi but it was directed because they were shitting on rest of us coz we voted for BJP by saying ""hurr durr muh literacy rate"" which infact is lower than a lot of states that voted for modi. It's a classic stratergy of a coward to play victim when called out. also, we know a tiny minority is secessionist and hate it driven towards them only.

&gt;Also are you guys happy about Lynching? Do you condemn the violence or support the killing of Muslims/Dalits because they carry/consume Beef? 

you got to be stupid to ask such a question. No sane individual support mob lynching. there are memes here and there about it but you expect that from a circlejerk sub posting stuff for shits and giggles. i support legal punishment for eating beef in places where it's banned.

&gt;Regarding Babri Masjid demolition and Gujarat Riots, Do you condemn the violence? 

It wasn't a masjid because there was no prayers offered in its complex for years. it was just a structure, nothing else and there was no harm in demolishing it.  
read what triggered the gujrat riots and come back. riots aren't pretty and no one likes or support them. so yes, any sane individual would condemn violence.

Finally, we don't give a flying fuck what others think of us. stay here and you'll be able to understand when we are joking around and when we are serious. I use ""we"" as i speak on behalf on most oldfags.

It would be simple to frame that radicalization in such a way that it argues that white christian people are the bad guys in this context - because they're creating a population of people who feels no hope for the future and resorts to extreme means.

374,ek6n7ex,"Seattle has seen a 300% increase in anti-Muslim hate crime arrests over that time frame, accounting for the vast majority of the increase.  Some 50 cases out of ~240 perpetrated last year.

That's extremely strong evidence that the difference is reporting, and more importantly, enforcement.  Seattle decided to stop fucking around, and they mean it.  This is a recent change.  There is no evidence that there wasn't the same number of hate crimes in 2014, they just never got reported cause no one thought the police would care.  Now Muslim Americans are believing people would care, and they are right.  Arrests are being made.

But dude, we're talking about a tiny fraction of a tiny fraction here.  There are what, ~2.3 million American adults who self identify as Muslim?  Something like 1.9m in 2014.  

That means just by the averages, you'd expect a muslim American to be the victim of violent crime maybe 7000 times in 2014, and 9200 times in 2018.

While hate crime incidents went from 90 to 240.  240 incidents, out of literally what, 1,200,000 violent crimes last year?  We're talking about super-minority (2.5%) of crimes against a superminority of the population.  We need to focus on big picture stuff.  Figuring out how to stem the increase in overall violent crime again, and hate crimes will go back down too.  Actual hate crimes.  The number of reported hate crimes will continue to rise, due to those improvements in enforcement.  There were probably a thousand such crimes in 2014, we just only heard about 90.  There were probably 1100 such crimes in 2018, we just only heard about 240."

Instead of a headscarf wear a beanie hat and a little neck scarf. Loose and oversize clothing and roll neck undershirts are quite fashionable now so I would work that kind of look. Zara.com trend this season is very modest. That's a good inspiration. 

That would be my temporary solution. Once you move to a more tolerant town you shouldn't have these problems.

380,e8ra1zv,"1. Now that gay marriage is legal somehow conservatives think we have full and equal rights. However, some conservative lawmakers (and right-leaning churches) push discrimination against LGBT individuals. It can come in the form of conversion therapy, refusing service, and even getting fired for simply being gay. Funny how Christian conservatives preach loving one another but have the biggest hindrances when it comes to social justice.

2. I will never understand the hate immigrants get. Yes, I understand there is a legal way but it takes way too long. Deporting people who have been in this country for decades is just morally wrong. Conservatives usually blame illegal immigrants for the debt in this country, but fail to realize they pay taxes and help our agricultural economy. They would rather push anti-immigrant hysteria instead of coming up with a pathway to permanent residency status. Also, a wall is completely useless. Border statistics show El Paso and San Diego to be 2 of the safest cities in the country even though they’re filled with illegals. These people are harmless.

3. Failing to understand the racism and discrimination that black people/POC face. They would rather “boycott” companies that stand with black people, than to understand the real purpose behind these pro - black movements.

4. The way the Muslim community is treated. No, I do not agree with everything Muslims stand by and especially not their anti-LGBT stance, but as long as these people mind their business and don’t hurt me then I’ll mind mine. I am also aware that Muslim-Americans are completely different (and very LGBT accepting) than Middle Eastern Muslims who practice Sharia law. 

5. Their stance on climate change. Yes, climate change is real and it doesn’t hurt to agree. Conservatives would rather be pro-business even if it means putting planet Earth at risk.

381,e3hmc6h,"Honestly I kind of hate watching this stuff. 

I don’t know this town in Arizona but I do know white-ass exurban or rural towns in MN where they’ve never met a Muslim and know nothing about them or Islam except what they’ve heard from Fox and the crazy evangelical groups that go around telling everybody about how all Muslims want to institute Sharia Law. I don’t see what the value is in sending a dressed up SBC in to show them plans of a ridiculous giant mosque in the middle of their town. Is it kinda funny in its absurdity? Sure. 

But what exactly is the point here? To show us all how ignorant these places can be? They elected Trump and will straight up tell you to your face they don’t like Muslims and don’t want them here. No disguise required. We already know. To make these people feel mocked and scorned publicly? That’ll sure help them feel like Muslim Americans are normal citizens who just want to live in peace like the rest of us. "
382,dzw8519,"In general men have more freedom to seek knowledge, venture outside of the home, become independent in Muslim societies. On the other hand women rarely get the same level of freedom.

Women are restricted and treated differently since birth. Even little girls are dressed differently to their brothers then made to wear the hijab which is drilled into their head as an important part of their identity, they are not allowed to go out as much, parents keep a strict watch on them because Muslim culture is very honour based and honour cultures are based around policing women and their actions. There is a psychological aspect to it, where from a very young age Muslim girls are raised to believe they are inferior, less intelligent and less capable than boys and they should be thankful for what ever scraps of good treatment and rights are thrown their way. 

Socially not conforming has serious implications for women. They might be deemed unmarriageable. Their husbands can leave them very easily without them having any recourse, they can face domestic violence without getting any help, their kids can be taken away etc. All of this keeps women subservient because society does not treat “rebellious” women kindly. Since many Muslim women don’t have careers or jobs, it’s difficult for them to survive on their own. 

There are no real implications for a man drifting from the norm. Mo Salah wears shorts above his knees &amp; Muslims love him. As a Muslim woman I got hate from men for the smallest transgression in my clothing. Men can date and marry non Muslim women. Yet I can’t. 

Men don’t face a restrictive lifestyle due to Islam, their every action isn’t monitored and judged. They can ponder over religion, leave it or stay with it no one will care. Women can’t.

384,dt1uuew,"Kindness and tolerance breed kindness and tolerance.  Hate and intolerance breed hate and intolerance.  I won't get into what's true and what's misconception about Islam or talk about what percentage of Muslims are this or that.  For the sake of argument let's assume the worst for just a moment:  The current generation will eventually grow old and die.  As will the next.  And so on.  If each generation in turn sees the people and cultures they have been taught to hate being nothing but kind and tolerant towards them, it gets more and more difficult to pass that hatred on to the next generation.  It's human nature, at least in part, to like people who like you.  It's also human nature to hate people who kill your loved ones, level your cities, and destroy everything you know and cherish. Remember that Christians and Jews were committing some of the most horrific atrocities imaginable not very long ago at all. Personally, I think the continued effort ensure that Muslim girls are educated will shift the entire culture.  It shifted western culture quite a lot.

My personal opinion is that organized religion, in general, is almost always a negative force in the world, but I don't think it will be going away any time in the next millennia or two.  Fading maybe, but not going away.  We can keep butchering each other or we can figure out how to live together in peace and love one another.

&gt; Even as representations of Arab and Muslim Americans appeared to be improving, their real lives told a different story. Hate crimes, workplace discrimination, airline discrimination and mosque vandalism have all increased exponentially. According to the FBI, Muslim Americans are five times more likely to be the victim of a hate crime today than before 9/11.  A 2012 survey by the Arab American Institute found that 55 percent of Arab American Muslims have experienced discrimination and 71 percent fear future discrimination.

&gt;  I've never heard any of them talk about discrimination.

I've come to realise on this forum that you can easily spot when someone knows they are bullshitting when they frame a statement, not in any factual sense (such as the statistics above) but rather based on what they have personally claimed to have heard. 

The advantage of the rhetorical trick is that it is, of course, impossible to dispute what you have or haven't heard. So the person gets to make whatever statement they like and make it sound like it is backed up by something. Of course it isn't. What you have or haven't heard is entirely irrelevant, as there are nearly an infinite number of reasons why what you have heard is not representative of what is happening.

So I hope that explains why I'm just going to ignore anymore ""I heard""/""I havent' heard"" comments from you. 

&gt; Except that's demonstrably false because white women in France and Quebec are required to follow the ban.

Europen people have been wearing clothing that covers the face for centuries, including to commit crimes such as ski masks, without this being made illegal. It only became a 'problem' when with the influx of Arabian and Persian immigrants. Then something had to be done.

Interesting read though, but a lot has changed since then thankfully. The nationalist party that was labeled literal Nazis in 2006 will most likely be the largest party in the election next year.

It's certainly true that Swedish feminism is in love with Islam for some reason. It must be defended at every cost. The article mentions Gudrun Schyman, founder of the feminist party, who *is* influential for real and probably the single most destructive individual in Swedish politics the last two decades. She laid the foundation for this attitude that 'there is no honor/culture related violence'. Everything stems from patriarchal oppression and Islam has nothing to do with it.

The Feminist Party declared this year that they didn't have a plan (or need) for aiding immigrant women who were abused or controlled at home and accused Swedish men who support such aid for veiling their racism in concern for Muslim women. The violence of Swedish men is far greater too of course.

I mean, I've had Muslim friends, classmates and an Iranian girlfriend. A lot of Muslim girls are oppressed to some degree. Anyone who's met a Muslim knows this. They'll tell you themselves. These feminists won't accept that though. Rich, white, gender studying bitches who has never lived in a non-white area. They'd rather actively hurt Muslim women if it hurts white men too.

&gt; If 3% of the population produces 90% of a specific crime, there's a problem within that community. This doesn't exist anywhere else in Europe except in UK because UK is the only country with significant Pakistani population. You have a perfect controlled experiment right there.

First off. Again, it's not 3% of the population doing that. Unless you are suggesting that 100% of people of Pakistani descent are child groomers. 

Secondly. I can't say whether or not it exists in Europe. But the fact of the matter remains that it isn't just Pakistani descended Muslims doing this in the UK. There are white British men doing it too. And blacks.

You claimed that Pakistanis do it because of their culture. I simply asked why do the white ones do it then.

That triggered you and here we are.

 &gt; Most foreigners in Asia are white. And this isn't a controlled experiment because it's a self selecting group. Pedos go to certain Asian countries for that specific reason. It's not like a random sample of white people went there and produced this discrepancy.

Where did all this controlled experiment lark come from?

Whites in Asia are as much a self selecting group as Pakistanis in Britain. Also, they go to Asia under the pretence of charity and teaching English etc. 

&gt; On other hand, a fairly random sample of Pakistanis moved to UK. This wasn't an organized move by people who planned on gang raping kids, it was a mass movement of millions of people.

No. Britain doesn't have a fairly random sample of Pakistanis. Most Pakistanis in the UK have roots in specific parts of Pakistan. Mostly Punjabis and Kashmiris.

&gt; Baby rapists are truly in a category of their own, I've never heard of anything like this and you have to admit it's extremely uncommon.

Maybe if the weren't white you would have heard about it.

&gt; Nobody is saying there are no organized white pedos

Except for you:

&gt; This doesn't exist anywhere else in Europe except in UK because UK is the only country with significant Pakistani population

&gt; is it just an insane accident, a statistical anomaly that ***all*** of these organized grooming cases are Pakistanis

&gt;  How could so many Pakistani gangs get caught without any white gangs getting caught?

Despite the fact I showed you one? lol

.
&gt;The fact you managed to find someone from the other 10% doesn't disprove my hypothesis.

What hypothesis? You wrote:

&gt; Is this the result of poverty or shitty cultural values based on idea that if a girl is uncovered and/or non-muslim, you can do with her however you please?

In reference to Telford. I simply replied: 

&gt; These white Brits did similar. Was that the result of ""shitty cultural values based on idea that if a girl is uncovered and/or non-muslim, you can do with her however you please?""

You asked a question and I asked one back. You fucking moron.

And I just have to say as well your first question wasn't a yes or no one. Dipshit.

&gt;&gt;Tell me what you think drives the white ones to do it, if the muslims are driven by their culture.

&gt;As I already explained, there are perverts and rapists among every population. So there's a baseline level of abuse one can expect due to the fact there's a small percentage of people with biological proclivity to do this kind of thing. Among those people there are those who will refrain themselves if the environment they're in doesn't tolerate this in any way shape or form. Among non-Muslim Birtons abusing helpless girls is more of a taboo than it is among Pakistani Muslims because there is a belief that non-Muslim girls are less worthy because they're seen as immoral for not being modest, not covering themselves, going out partying, etc. In their culture, a girl or a woman who behaves like that deserves what's coming to her. Now that doesn't mean every single man will behave like a monster because most people are decent. But those who might be tilting towards that kind of behavior feel less restrained due to this cultural belief.

Where are you getting this deep insight to pakistani culture. And got it white people are biologically programmed to fuck people against their will.

&gt; There's no empirical reason to believe this. How could so many Pakistani gangs get caught without any white gangs getting caught? And not only are they not getting caught in UK, they're not getting caught anywhere in Europe or the west (since we all share western culture and crime patterns among us are fairly similar). This is a really, really weak argument.

You are a really simple fellow aren't you. It's not a difficult concept and of course their is no evidence.

Pakistani immigrants were able to evade the law for decades, with a poor understanding of the local language and culture. 

If we were talking a decade ago. We wouldn't have had this conversation. And you would have those stats that you're pushing. Not because there wasn't pakistani men gang raping children. But because they evaded the law.

Is it not possible that native white Britons are more adept at evading the law or even suspicion? 

And PS. if their are no case of child grooming in Europe does that not suggest that white Britons have a child rape culture? Given the fact that they do constitute 16% of all cases. Where mainland Europe according to you has none.

In order to end rape culture we have to fight against EVERY part of it, not just the non-religious parts. Why does spreading rape culture somehow become alright just because it’s religious? 

People are getting raped RIGHT NOW due to the rape culture spread by religion. Muslim girls are getting raped because of religious teachings. Mormon girls are getting raped because of religious teaching. Christian girls are getting raped because of religious teaching- child marriage still happens in the US and it’s almost entirely religious, mostly fundamentalist Christians.

But the fact that other religions do it too doesn’t make it alright for Islam to do it. The fact that secular people can spread rape culture doesn’t make it alright for a religion to spread it. All your answers are just “whataboutism”- there’s no defense for Islam revering a rapist and saying he was perfect, the harm caused by that is indisputable. That’s why no one ever has any “defense” of it beyond “Well other groups also do bad things that contribute to rape culture.” Two wrongs don’t make a right. Misogyny and homophobia in Islam isn’t somehow okay just because Christians do it too.

"
416,es7j6sw,"I think religion (any religion) threatens the power of the state.  So people who believe in the state having supreme power over you (ie communists, socialists), tend to be more anti-religion.  As these ideologies become more prevalent in America, they are lashing out at the religions in our country (primarily Christianity, but not just Christianity).  It’s cool and socially acceptable to criticize Christianity, though the same cannot be said for other religions or institutions that have a huge pedophilia and child-trafficking problem (ie CPS, or even the NXIVM trial that is completely unreported, in which celebrities and elites branded women, trafficked kids as sex slaves, and operated 11 day care centers).

You are right, we have to criticize ourselves.  Anybody who hides behind the mantle of faith to molest children is the scum of the earth, and should be punished to the fullest extent of secular and religious law.  They are an affront to God.  The Catholic Church has earned condemnation for how they have handled pedophilia.  I think there are truly evil people in the Vatican, and pray that Pope Sarah becomes a reality. 

But Christianity, as a whole, does not have an unparalleled problem with pedophilia.  Take Islam, for example.  I will get downvoted to hell for saying it, but Islam has an institutionalized pedophilia problem.  Mohammed married a six year old and thighed her until she was nine, at which point he began raping her.  FGM is practiced on little girls (even here in America) as young as five, so they can never experience anything but pain during intercourse.  American troops were ordered to ignore Baccha Bazi boys in Afghanistan and Iraq.  These boys, as young as six or seven, were taken to the Islamic leaders and clerics and sodomized.  Our soldiers were ordered to stand down while listening to their screams because it was their “culture” to rape little boys.  Islam also allows for familial rape gangs (as seen in many towns, especially Rotherham, in Britain), in which non-Muslim girls are kept as sex slaves while men literally line up around the block to rape them.  Because they aren’t Muslim children, it’s okay to use them as sex slaves.  But, though pedophilia is rampant in that religion, it’s social suicide to even criticize Islam.  Why is that?"
417,eoewx73,Genesis make it very clear that jewish boys must be cut before the age of 8 days (also the slaves of jews). It is also a thing in islam that nearly all muslim boys are circumcised . I dono why the non-jewish and non-muslim Americans do it since the hygiene arguments originally were because they didn't have water in the desert with which to clean themselves and it was hot and sandy.
418,eezf23p,"The earliest Muslims in America were African slaves, and there is a sizable convert population. But I would say that the majority of Muslim Americans are from Arab, African and South Asian lands, who immigrated within the last few decades ('70s to '90s).    
So it depends on your definition of ""immigrant"", as the majority of them didn't migrate to the US recently.  Although, we don't want to discount the recent refugees who are indeed helping out as well :)"
419,ebyucka,"Muslims are not trying to colonize Canada. Muslims want to migrate to Canada either in search of economic opportunity or to escape religious persecution and/or warfare (ie. Shia Yemeni refugees facing religious persecution from Sunni Islam Saudi Arabians).

Muslims are breeding faster than Christians. It is what it is. Muslims breed without even thinking about the consequences because they use their children as slaves basically in their homeland. Eventually after a couple generations, Muslims in the west are going to realize that having lots of kids in an urban area with child labour laws is counter-productive. I see so many of these Muslim girls in Canada, even ones who wear the hijab, who are being westernized and they turn into total whores for Chad. And they catch all of these STDs and then become infertile. I wouldn't worry. When Muslims assimilate into our way of life, they are going to stop breeding. There are multiple STDs that can render you infertile. Condom usage is already very lax with western thots and I imagine that these Muslim girls are even less likely to use condoms."

No one here is saying *all* Muslims are bad. No one is saying *all* Muslim girls are forced to wear the Hinab. No one is saying *all* women not wearing a Hijab will end up in hell. You are doing a strawman argument and criticizing it.

What we are saying however is that a majority of women in Islam are forced to wear the Hijab. This is backed by statistics and polls. You cannot refute that. What we are saying is that there is *at least* one person who will go to eternal hell fire, as your god said in the Quran that some people *will* go to eternal hell. So either someone must go to eternal fire, or your god is a liar. I am guessing you will agree that at least one person will go to hell eternally. In that case, your god is absolutely sadistic. No finite sin, no matter how evil, deserves eternal torture. Whatever harm your sin has done is only finite in this “finite” universe. But in return, your god decided to torture and punish that person eternally.

432,fv417oh,"&gt; In many cases, the girls seem genuinely religious which is most surprising.

Yes, that's because a lot of Muslim girls are actually Muslim and not just pretending or forced to be. Why do you think this idea that ""hijab is a choice"" is so prevalent in the west? It's because a lot of the vocal Muslim girls that promote that idea genuinely believe it."

Let's back up - you acknowledge that some portion Muslim girls are forced to wear the burka and get beaten if they don't, right? I assume you grant this point, since doing otherwise would be simply denying reality.

So, the question is how large is the group, and what about those who aren't getting beat up. I am saying those who aren't beaten are emotionally blackmailed, browbeaten, and threatened with shunning to a degree that makes any ""choice"" in the matter impossible and irrelevant. This is from my ex-Muslim friends who experienced this first hand - and btw they will all tell you that they would say the hijab was their choice back then too but they will tell you know they that were lying."

\-This isn't really far-fetched. Muslim girls and boys who are friends, then lovers, and who even end up married is something common, especially in western countries were mixed universities, schools and high-school are the norm. Most ""liberal"" muslim parents will just forbid anything sexual *(kissing, playing and you know...)*. 

\-From a strictly islamic point of view, that's not yet a major sin, but it's not appreciated. Your muslim audience also might get the deeling that you're saying *""muslim girls are emprisonned in the hijab, muslim girls ! free yourself !""*, so it might not be well received, except if you're really respectful and not edgy about it. 

All in all, writing romances won't really get you problems *(or so I think)*."

441,fmoqrjv,"Whattaboutism.

I personally have zero problems with a hijab because I can see a woman's face and it isn't dehumanizing.

In Christianity...

&gt; 1 Corinthians 11:6 - For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.


People are bad at arguing. Christianity states that women should be covered the same as Islamic women. There is no Quranic justification for burqas and niqabs so the religions are equal rhetorically on this issue though not *in practice.* Christianity now is some sanguine, platitudinous, reductive philosophy about an all-accepting Christ.

It would be great if ten years from now Muslim girls are real sluts and dykes are performing marriages in mosques. Those would be markers that Islam has been reformed to fit our western values.

I'm curious why you think every right winger is religious and unwilling to criticize Christianity? Or why you think Anglo Canadians give a shit about Catholicism other than the dagos, micks, polacks? Outside Quebec there are more Protestants than Catholics by a wide margin and those groups never got along."

But on a serious note, this is actually pretty common. Even if they dont look as slutty as this chick, hijab or not....Muslim girls are devils. If you are not Muslim AVOID AT ALL COSTS. If you are Muslim, just exercise all due diligence  before committing. AWALT but every Muslim Women has the propensity to ruin your life in the name of God. This has personally happened to me. Goody Goody two shoes Hijab wearing Muslim girl acts all pious and god fearing. You get to know them a little bit and then they start asking questions about my past relationships and being a pretty religious guy myself I have only been on very casual coffee ""*dates""*. 

Its the same story every time:

\- Girls have ridden the cock carousel and looking for an sad innocent virgin simp so accept them and their past of being used as a cum dumpster of other Muslim Chads (who she berates on Social Media btw lol)

\- Girl realizes that I have not had previous relationships due to religious reasons and thinks that just because I hold my religious values dear, she can walk all over me and I will be all about forgiveness and mercy.

\- Make it extreme clear that I'm not going to marry/engage with a whore (sometimes before they confess their infidelity lol) and they usually panic at this point when they realize how I actually feel about it. They nearly always confess their pasts to me thinking I would just be able to sleep thinking that XX amount of them have fucked this women, when its stipulated day in and day out. 

\- Girls lash out and ""All Men Are Trash"" tweets are born on Muslim Twitter/Instagram. Also am vilified for not accepting her past and being ""shallow and close-minded"" Still have the last laugh tho because we both know she still can't tell her friends and parents how much of a whore she is."

I have had many Muslim friends in college. Some of their families were very liberal, some very orthodox. Some girls wore Hijab on their own without any coercion from their family. A lot of people really get upset over the fact that Muslim girls are ""forced"" to cover their head and wear modest clothes. But the truth is that an average Malayali girl is always forced to be modest. My mother never allowed me to wear sleeveless clothes. Still doesn't. I can wear it as long as I am out of Kerala and out of the direct line of sight of relatives and naattukar. I have never seen anyone tying my Hindu religion with the ban of wearing sleeveless clothes. We are all a bunch of hypocrites."
444,f7ac5h5,"Well as a muslim women who is in her early twenties I'll like to comment btw I am not trying to invalidate what you went through and honestly a lot of it seems like bad parenting:

&gt; At  the age of 7, my mom deterred me from riding a bicycle claiming it’s  not for girls. I grew up and discovered it might tear up the hymen(oh  noo!)

I rode a bike until I was 12 because no one in my area rode bikes for fun anymore and your hymen breaking in islam its not a sin and even scholars say a broken hymen doesn't mean the girl messed around they can break for many reasons like even doing a split.

&gt;About  a year later, i rode a bike secretly sitting behind my cousin.  strangers in the streets stared in a shameful way. In my grandma’s  neighborhood we passed next to a group of men who malignantly laughed  and . ended up snitching and getting my in trouble.

Wth that's literally quite sad you were eight come on that's toxic culture right there.

&gt;At the age of 9 I’ve been told to not play with boys at school. I did anyways cuz boys are much funnier to play with Lol.

Well in secondary school and college I still chilled and talked to guys but it was always in a public space and no one talked behind my back or bothered me for it and i know plenty of muslim girls like that.

&gt;At  10-11, i grew fast and tall with some boobs looking like a 16 yo. My  dad began sticking his nose on every single detail regarding my clothes.  He didn’t force me to wear the hijab as I didn’t get my period yet, but  i remember feeling uncomfortable about him staring at my body and  asking me to wear more loose-fitting. I spent my life after that  worrying if he wouldn’t be satisfied about my clothes. As my thighs got  bigger, I couldn’t wear jeans anymore without a long top. Also, he  caught me once with a boy around my age shopping together and yelled at  my mom for letting me leave the house alone.

Well my dad didn't care what we wore in the sense as long as we didn't wear tank tops (I often wear them at home) or shorts and mini skirts in public and didn't go out sleeveless he didn't care and we didn't as it was sinful and it didn't bother me a lot tbh wearing ripped jeans or wearing sleeveless tops weren't really my thing as I knew it was sinful so I would avoid wearing them and your dad is obsessed its literally weird and bad parenting.

&gt; At  12, i got my period. I knew I had to wear the hijab just like most my  friends did so I didn’t complain about it that time.plus I wanted to  satisfy god and not get him angry.

I had my period around the time I was 10 and 11 my dad didn't talk about it my mom just advised me to wear pads instead of tampons lol and I chose to wear the hijab later on when I was around 18 and I ended up taking it off my mom still advice's me to wear it but my dad was annoyed I took it off after a couple of months in wearing it and we did clash a bit but now he doesn't bother me in wearing one.

&gt; During  that time, i met a female friend online and we started having girls  conversations about  boys. Someone posted a nude in her profile. My  uncle was prying my friends list on facebook and saw it. He snitched to  my dad who read our private conversations, locked me in the room, and  broke down my laptop.

Honestly that sad your uncle and dad are creepy ugh I feel bad for you in islam its even haram to spy on others.

&gt;At  13, my dad was monitoring me everywhere. He caught me once shaking my  teacher’s hand. He yelled and sweared, warning me to not touch any male  again.

Your dad is a weirdo honestly and my male teachers never shaked our hands especially at 13.

&gt;At  14,my dad’s role disappeared as he moved away. My mom authorized me  afterwards and whenever she witnessed me being verbally harassed, she  would assume I smile to them and ask me to walk with my head down.

Shitty dad and let me guess he also drank and did haram things on the side its literally al cultural here. My parents would tell me to fight back and take no bullshit from no one.

&gt;At the age of 15 she slapped me after reading my love feelings for a crush my diary without my permission.

Snooping is haram and having a crush is not haram either unless you acted on it tbh I never kept a dairy I found it weird.

&gt;At  16 she locked me in the house for a whole summer and didn’t allow me to  hang out with friends or joining their”only girls” parties assuming I  was tricking her to hang out with a boyfriend. She also never allowed me  to participate in sports as it involved leaving the house and going to  crowded places with boys possibly watching me play and looking at my  body.

Honestly not even islam allows a parent to have such control over there kids especially if they were not doing haram things I feel you here my dad tried to limit me going out to much but I fought back or even going out after 8pm because my brothers were allowed me and my sisters weren't but after talking it out my dad didn't care as long as I wasn't clubbing or chilling with my boyfriend or whatever he didn't care and honestly its sad that our parents automatically think we up to no good like chill lol.

&gt;At  the age of 17 we moved to the USA and her control became harsher as she  wanted me to stay religious. She would take my phone away if i refused  to pray and call me a bitch if i showed a tiny piece of my neck or hair.  High school helped me open up and be critical to all the religious  beliefs i ever was convinced about.

Honestly your parents are shitty literally they don't deserve to have kids.

&gt;Finally,  as i said before, It’s either the muslim girls are tricking you or they  are tricked like I was. 

Your shitty life experiences doesn't mean this is a normal and common thing from islam and that every muslim girl went through the same thing you went through because its not every person is different and its your parents they are bad parents.

&gt; I always thought that the men of  the house have the authority to control me as I’m weaker(that’s what  Quran says) 

That only applies in marriage honestly I hope you leave that toxic family."

448,eyo883m,"I've been thinking about this more recently. How damaging it must be for young girls to be forced to cover at such a young age while their male counterparts are free to do whatever they want. It goes beyond physically covering but many muslim girls are policed from a very young age to sit a certain way, speak a certain way, to not speak to certain people. Why is it that we are not allowed to be carefree even as children? I'm sorry for what you're experiencing op and I've been in a similar boat. I'm a year younger than you and I've recently gone through some major life changes and have also changed how I dress (still very modest with hijab). With some muslim parents, you really need to assert yourself and almost ""teach"" them how to treat you if you want to live a more autonomous life. I've done that with my incredibly devout helicopter mother. I love her to death and I know she loves me but I've had to respectfully set boundaries and make clear that this is my life to live."
449,euh1oyh,"I think it’s totally normal to think a hijabi is beautiful! I have many hijabi friends and i always admire how well their hijab style suits them, or how modest yet beautiful their style is.

Actually, thank you for this! It’s a bit saddening how people think beauty is the opposite of modesty, yet there are many girls out there who slay and look beautiful modest too!

I also know several people who took off hijab. In my opinion, if they need time to fix their faith, get closer to Allah, or just try and understand the idea of hijab more, then they can do what they want and then put it on when they feel like they’re ready.

(Ps: some girls wear hijab to strengthen their faith too. Its not wrong either)


Although it can be painful, especially in the summer when it’s boiling hot, or when i look at myself in the mirror when I’m not wearing the hijab, I cannot help but rethink the hijab to myself.

I googled if some muslim girls are similar to me, and i come across this girl that said that she considers hijab as a connection between her and Allah, and that despite the idea of hijab doesn’t completely make sense (in her opinion), but she’d rather satisfy Allah rather than a creepy old man looking for lust.

In my opinion, those who looked at you in a rude way IN A MOSQUE are not aware of you just trying it on. What they did was wrong.

I experienced it once or twice too.

But oh well, as long as I’m happy and comfortable, while making Allah happy, they’re no one to judge!

Again, thank you so much for this!! :) sorry I rambled a lot haha"
450,eulr9jv,"The transition is definitely difficult, I've seen it with one of my friends who tried to start wearing hijab and just couldn't. The older you are the harder it gets unfortunately. Its a very noticeable difference, not just the losing friends part (which even nonmuslims can relate to, like if they change their diet/lifestyle). But the part where people actually start treating you differently, like you're an outsider or invisible, that's hard for others to understand. Its very real and kind of dehumanizing. 

But you're doing it for Allah, not for other people, and I think hijab actually makes that easier. Its like a filter that creates a clear division between sin/toxicity and good/healthy. Like all good things its hard at first but gets easier. You know how when you go on a diet or start exercising, its literally physically painful at times but then later you start seeing the benefits? Its like that, give it time. And ultimately would you really be able to be happy if you gave up? Yes people would be more friendly to you without hijab, but are they really being nice to ""you""? 

I think what could have made the transition easier was if you found some supportive hijabi friends before you started wearing hijab, but you can't always wait until you have friends to start being modest. And some muslim girls are definitely very cliquey, I don't understand it. They're really immature, judgy and prideful. But there's also some really amazing supportive sisters. I have social anxiety and purposely avoid people, which can come off as really snobby/standoffish but even with that kind of attitude there were sisters who went out of their way to try and include me. They exist and there are many!! You just havent met them yet but you will inshaallah, dont give up!! 

Instead of staying at home and giving into the depression/anxiety, maybe try going out and doing volunteer work? Or take Islamic classes? What part of Canada are you from? There's a Meetup group for muslim sisters in toronto if you want to [check it out](https://www.meetup.com/Young-Muslim-Sisters-in-Mississauga/). I know its easier said than done but you're doing the right thing, on the right path, and you'll be rewarded for all your struggles and all your patience. Its worth it."
451,ev0pac5,"&gt; If a character is more sexualized than others in a setting that does not fit and it is not explained why this character is more sexualized, than the character is oversexualized.

Nope not even then, you just end up with a infinite regress.

Allow me to demonstrate: So you have 3 women.

Woman 1 is wearing a conservative pant suit.

Woman 2 is wearing shorts and a big fluffy jumper 

Woman 3 is wearing a mini skirt &amp; a crop top.

None of them have been given any context to why they are wearing what they are wearing, so the question then becomes which one is over sexualised. Is it woman number 3? She's wearing the least, but woman number 2 is wearing less that woman number 1, but more than woman number 3? So is she Schrodinger's over sexualised woman?

Or are they **ALL** over sexualised, because they could all be wearing burkas &amp; they aren't. Then when you put them in burkas, why aren't they wearing large cardboard boxes? Clearly those women in burkas as over sexualised now because they could be wearing large cardboard boxes &amp; they aren't.

See how you end up with an infinite regress into absurdity. And it goes in to absurdity not because I'm pushing it to absurdity, but because there is no limiting factor, till eventually they slide in to the realms of the absurd.

Or to put it differently, if you have a girls school class room full of muslim girls in hijabs, that doesn't make the catholic girl in a prim and proper catholic school girl uniform, complete with full stockings, tie &amp; blazer over sexualised.

All you've done is said ""this girl is wearing more body masking designed clothes that these others are.

So if we took that catholic girl &amp; put her in a cardboard box, that's even more body shrouding that the girls in hijabs. So by your logic now the room full of hijab wearing muslim girls are over sexualised.

At some point along this infinite regress you kind of have to look at what you are doing &amp; realise you aren't actually describing what's objectively present, you are simply prescribing things by way of moral judgement."

456,eqdisn5,"Girl, Muslim boys are the absolute worst. The most hypocritical, holier-than-thou, double standard bastards you’ll find.

With no exception (perhaps maybe 3), all my ‘Muslim guy’ friends came to uni in the UK, commonly had drugs and prostitutes and nights in the club. Yet they used to shame the living fuck out of one of the Muslim girls in class because she was outspoken, ‘cool’ and didn’t do hijab. Like what about them, y’know?

Also, considering he’s a ‘good Muslim boy’ “who would marry you despite your faults” (and hold it over your head to emotionally manipulate you perpetually), you’ve really dodged a bullet here. They are very entitled by their religion, to everything. After marriage he would have been much worse to you, believing he has all of [these rights by Islam](https://muflihun.com/ibnmajah/9/1853).

He was an absolute fucking twat. Trust me, as a guy, I know many guys like him. You don’t wanna marry them or be with them. I’m very sorry about the pain you’ve been through, but in a way I’m also glad you’re out of that relationship which undoubtedly would have crushed your self-esteem and even caused severe mental health problems further down the line.

Virginity is a man-made concept, because most (yes, truly most) of these *men* aren’t virgins but they don’t lose out because of it - only you do. So, define yourself as you yourself want to, it’s only up to you, and fuck all those boys who’d look at you like a candy with a broken seal. You’re a person. And you have much more to offer than they will ever appreciate.

With this in mind, best of luck OP. Get the duck out of there, please and thanks. And perhaps seek professional help to overcome the trauma he’s most likely put you through.

You’re not a virgin? So what? Most of *them* aren’t either, and it doesn’t make you anything less. If anything that only weeds out the holier-than-thou assholes and allows you to find an actually good man who will appreciate who you actually are."

It is frustrating to have my son come home from school and tell me the things that are going on in our district.  Not just with this new situation with the Muslim students getting thirty minutes (1:00-1:30) everyday to leave class to pray/reflect on religion, but other little things.  For example, if my son wears a hoodie to school and puts the hood up because his head is cold, he gets reprimanded and told he may not do that and has to put his hood down.  Several students have been told to put their hoods down.  Yet the Muslim girls are allowed to cover their entire head with their hijab and that is okay.  Many of the students are upset about this and even though they are only in middle school, they understand that something is off about this.  Last week on the announcements they told students about the new prayer room for Muslim students.  This upset numerous other students who immediately questioned why some kids get to leave math to go pray-why can't anyone go outside for thirty minutes everyday if they want to pray to the sun or whatever they want to do to honor their religion.  Apparently prayer in school is now acceptable, but only if you are Muslim.  I got this information from my son, but have yet to receive an e-mail or any information from the school letting parents know that this is a new option for students.  It is strange there is no notification for parents.  There have been numerous situations with the influx of Muslims in our school district.  It is not a good thing."

It'll never be 100% coverage but indeed more muslim girls are wearing hijab now than ever before. Most people from our grandparents generation never wore it, if you looks at countries like Egypt 50 years ago people looked down on women who covered their hair.  "
468,eagi5l6,"Ok. What about lesbian relationships? It is not entering filth anymore.

No matter what you say, you have to agree men and women don’t have the same rights in Islam and that is my problem. Why can’t a girl do something just for the way she was born, something she had no control over?
“She has different kind of rights.” Many muslims say that but what if she wants the rights men have? Why can’t she have it? She’s human too.

“Men are attracted to women in a different manner than women to men.” Nope. I know a lot of girls with the same type of attraction guys have. You only think otherwise because Muslim girls are too shy to voice their opinions. 

I didn’t say anything about going out naked. Only without hijab. In other countries, people still go out without covering their faces. They are doing fine. 

The rest you said relies on the logic that Allah does exist. Imagine Allah didn’t exist. The rest of your arguments don’t make sense anymore.
Of course, he was the “trustworthy” person. He was “the Prophet” of “the one true God.”

As for the challenge to bring forward a book, maybe scholars brought it forward. Muhammed was in charge. They had to bring it forward to Muhammed. And this would take everything away from him. He could easily drop the scholar who brought it and say No one brought anything forward.

Also, why is Quran in Arabic and why do I have to offer prayers in Arabic? This was part of the reason I turned. My prayers, me reciting the Quran , nothing made sense anymore. Cuz I didn’t even understand Arabic. 
"
469,e9bgy4o,"It's not my experience here in Europe. I can't remember the last time I've seen a Muslim man wearing modest clothing, I guess they wear normal clothing? I do know that while Muslim girls are not in every case pressured to wear the hijab they have to endure much more pressure from their parents to conform to what a girl can and can't do. The sons don't have to live up to the same standards and get a lot of free passes."
470,e7eiww1,"Nope, Muslim girls are supposed to be virgins until getting married and, despite that, single girls, even very young ones, wear the hijab.

If the Islamic country they live in doesn't force women to wear the hijab from a certain age on, some factions or families may allow their girls/women to ""choose"" whether they want to wear a hijab or not, but how much of choice is it really when a girl is surrounded by women wearing hijabs or accessories and garments that offer even more coverage?

There may be the possibility of choice in some Muslim societies and families, but directly or indirectly, Muslim girls are compelled to wear hijabs and other Islamic accessories and garments because of religious, cultural, and social pressure, which includes a higher possibility of being raped if they choose not to comply with the ""modesty"" requirement."
471,e7wnx9u,"What the fuck are you even talking about? Your belief in God has nothing to do with whether or not your citing actual evidence for a claim. We're talking about whether muslim girls are pressured into wearing a hijab. You state they are forced. I said that may be true in some cases, but in others that's not true. You said you disagree. 

I asked you to maybe search for some opinions online, which you can easily find. You obviously don't do that and just ""yeah I'm right and you can't say otherwise because my opinion matters despite the fact I'm making up all this shit"".

And now you bring up god. I don't believe you're real. I think I'm done with this conversation. Have a blessed day."
472,e4pfwrt,"On the other hand, a certain proportion of visibly Muslim girls are actually closeted ex-muslim girls who only wear the hijab to avoid unpleasant repercussions in their families and communities - consequences ranging from verbal admonishment through social or familial ostracism, to violence and even death by honour-killing."
473,e3z1oft,"But they don't wear it by their own choice, muslim girls are indoctrinated from a very young age that if you don't wear a niqab/burqa/hijab then you're immoral, indecent and you should be ashamed of yourself. 

&gt;And if they are forced - it's oppressors who should be persecuted, not them.

You can't prosecute something that is deeply ingrained in a society. There is no clean way on how to solve this."
474,e2h1sn7,"Except you're treating hijab wear (in this case burqas) devoid of it's religious and cultural context. Women don't simply decide to done hijab wear one day because they sorta liked it, hijab culture is most often inculcated into young Muslim girls by their families before they even hit puberty. 

Contrary to popular belief, hijab wear is not something that a Muslim 'chooses to wear'. It is a commandment by their religion to cover their whole body (from head to toe sans face and hands according to most fiqh), refusing to do so means they are sinning against god and endanger themselves to jahannam (hell). Young Muslim girls are brainwashed with such scary imagery to pressure them to follow the hijab dresscode.

Also, let's not forget that hijab culture is usually enforced by not just their families, but their communities too. It's not just the men who expect Muslim women to wear hijab, other Muslim women often pressure other Muslim women to wear hijab too. In most conservative families, the Muslim daughter is expected to have hijab wear on everytime she goes out, or else she would be chastised and punished, sometimes with corporal punishment (beatings, canings, etc).

There's a lot of reasons why hijab culture should be curtailed among the Muslim community. To simply view it in simple terms is doing injustice to the many women who are suffering around the world due to hijab culture."
475,e20f0x0,"It's mostly towards the women. But Muslim Americans are much more liberal nowadays.  Where i live it's 90% Arab/Muslim but you still see the same brothers from the mesjid at the club the next night lol. City is called Dearborn, Michigan,  just bordering Detroit. 

Edit: oh and don't get me wrong the Muslim girls here are like 40/60 on fucking before marriage, probably lower if they wear the hijab. It's just socially more accepable for a Muslim man to lose his virginity before marriage than a women.... although both are frowned upon in islam"
476,dzr3snu,"so her sweeping generalization is offensive and disgusting, but yours isn't? 

Give me a break.

Maybe your brother married a girl from back home and they are a perfect match. Mashallah that's great, there's someone for everyone inshallah. Hell, I married a guy from back home. But to say such a comment about American Muslim females is disgusting and incorrect. 

This is a difference between culture and religion. In my experience (being raised in the US, but currently living ""back home,"") GENERALLY SPEAKING, Muslim girls from ""back home"" are super cultural, but Muslim girls in the US are generally more spiritual, practicing, and connected with their religion. For example, I'm living in a Muslim country, but most of my friends here (even those who wear hijab) don't pray regularly. However, most (if not all) of my female friends in my city in the US regularly pray. 

I'm not saying it's like this everywhere, but don't go around giving the impression that American Muslim girls are not worthy of marriage. 

Miss me with this mansplaining ""girls in the West are heathens"" bs."
477,e0n819y,"A lot of American Muslim girls are like this as well. Fuck around and party for years but when it’s time to find a good guy to settle with, start posting yourself wearing a hijab on religious holidays, going to Friday prayers, and fasting during Ramadan."
478,dy8iy01,"&gt; What group are Hispanics forced into?

They're forced into ethnic grouping by no choice of their own. Look up the racist comments by Trump about Judge Curiel as an example. Look up the racist policing of Joe Arpaio as an example. Look at the way Muslim Americans are mistreated by random people just for wearing a hijab.

&gt; Not to play the identity politics, but to eliminate it. Perhaps identity politics is the vehicle which oppression occurs and is the “system” you should be targeting.

Identity politics isn't the vehicle of oppression. It's the effect of oppression. This is sort of a fundamental reality that has to be recognized before discussing it. If your goal is to separate politics from various forms of identity and tribalism, the first step needs to be eliminating the sorts of conditions that motivate identity based political grouping. 

This means the total obliteration of LGBT discrimination in marriage, adoption, insurance, hospital visitation, etc. It means the obliteration of racism in institutions. So no more statistically significant separation in hiring due to nothing but stereotyping based on someone's name. It means the elimination of voter suppression, the elimination of punishment for students based on race, the removal of sentencing rates based on race, etc. 

The list of ways in which society is still systemically discriminating should be the ENTIRE focus of anyone who wants to remove identity based politicking. "

480,dz2n0yf,"“Soo, I'm guessing this isn't pandering? As the character was created by a desi Muslim American creator, I don't suppose you're going to accuse the creators of ""not knowing anything"" about Islam.”

-No, it’s still pandering, because it’s made with the express purpose to appeal to a specific group of people while trying to promote the religion (and you know what, I change what I said before by adding an extra bit to it) while knowing nothing about it/presenting it in a way that tries to normalise or promote it. Also, if the creators (or in this case really only ONE creator) knew about isalm, then that makes it even worse because they are knowingly presenting islam in a false way by trying to normalise it. I don’t know how you can say this with a straight face. 


“Besides, right now all you're basing it off is the headline. The comic book character is not devout or particularly religious.

-For fucks sake how many times do I have to explain this? If you know anything about islam you would know that any muslim who doesn’t even follow their own rules is a massive hypocrite. They are trying to portray that islam allows its followers to live what we would class as normal lives but we both know that isn’t true. The image being portrayed in the miss marvel comic for the most part is a big lie. How can you not see anything wrong with that?


“You can yell all you want about how more and more Muslims aren't ""true Muslims"". Personally, I'm happy about it. “

-Wow. So you can’t even properly address my arguments. If that’s the case, why even respond?

“Christianity didnt become more secular by berating progressive or cultural Christians. If you want Islam to become more secular, I suggest you accept progressive Muslims rather than belittle them. “

-I think secular christians are massive hypocrites as well. They say they love christianity but ignore everything bad about it. I don’t want islam to become more secular; I want islam to go away, PERIOD. I want this to happen by people seeing why Islam truly represents and then people would naturally not want to associate with it anymore. Also, no, I’m not going to accept people who are massive hypocrites who ignore massive parts of their own religion.

“American Muslims are really not ""warped"" for the most part.”

-I never said muslims were all warped. I said islam was warped. Why do you keep repeating this same straw man?

“Maybe your experience was, but speaking from *my* experience most Muslim Americans are perfectly normal people.”

-I never said they weren’t, why the Earths do you assume I said that when I clearly didn’t? Why do you repeatedly say this pathetic argument all the time?


“There's nothing wrong with progressive,”

-It is when you are being a hypocrite, or promoting a religion that isn’t very progressive or if your views don’t turn out to be very progressive at all. 

“American-born Islam becoming more widespread. In fact, I think it's kinda ironic - when you berate the progressive American Muslim image, you're helping out the salafis and the traditionalist Muslims.”

-American born islam is a complete lie, and should be exposed as such. Also no I’m not helping out traditionalist muslims, I’m just showing islam for what it is. No need for pathetic arguments in which you put words into my mouth.


“They'd probably be on your side in wanting to get rid of this character”

-Exactly. Showing that people who follow Islam closely don’t agree with what is being presented in the miss marvel comics, meaning that them trying to present islam as something that is normal falls flat on its face. "
481,dwzkuby,These Muslim girls are taking the hijab too far!
482,du2r8km,Not exactly. Hijabs aren't exactly a fashion choice. We shouldn't allow parents to force totalitarian ideologies on their kids. If you're an adult woman feel free to wear a hijab. The problem is that Muslim girls are so indoctrinated they start to believe that they have to wear a hijab even if no one forces them directly.
483,du9we9z,"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-410312/Non-Muslim-students-Islamic-school-forced-wear-headscarves.html

In some Islamic schools in the UK the hijab is part of the uniform and non-Muslim girls are required to wear it.  The headmaster doesn’t see a problem with requiring non-Muslim girls to wear the hijab because their parents knew what the school uniform was when they signed them up and it is just a piece of cloth like a tie.  So why isn’t the reverse situation acceptable?  The Muslim parents also knew what the dress code was when they signed their kids up for school."

HOUSE OF COMMONS LONDON SW14 O.

The Rt Hon Justine Greening MP Department for Education Sanctuary Buildings 20 Great Smith Street 

Our Ref: PG1410 Re: Ofsted and hijabs in primary schools Dear Secretary of State, 

I am writing on behalf of the many constituents who have contacted me raising serious concerns about Ofsted's comments relating to the questioning of young Muslim girls wearing the Hijab in primary school. 

These comments have caused outrage amongst many of my constituents, and I am deeply concerned about the implications of such comments. I firmly believe in a person's right to choose their expression of faith. The freedom to practice faith - or not - is one of the cornerstones of the free and diverse democratic society in which we live. 
Successive Governments have emphasised the importance of freedom of religion and belief, and it is vital that all communities are able to practice their religion free from persecution. In particular, I believe that children should not be subjected to unnecessary questioning by Ofsted inspectors. 

I am sure that you will agree that all children should be free to practice their religion without undue interference. i ask that you work with Ofsted to ensure that young muslim girls are able to practice their religion free from discrimination or interrogation. 

I urge you to ensure that my constituents' concerns be adequately addressed and to create the necessary changes to ensure that Muslim girls do not attend school feeling the need to justify their wearing of a Hijab. 

Yours faithfully, 

Preet Kaur Gill MP Member of Parliament for Edgbaston

485,dsq0a4l,"Wild theory: You think it's possible that she didn't want to wear the hijab, cut it up, and made this story up to cover up that fact in front of her parents when they found out? Happens a lot where young Muslim girls are forced to wear a hijab, especially really young ones who didn't make that choice them self. 
"
486,dsrslur,"&gt;Yes, yes, let me re-phrase what you're saying. ""Yes I know that's what YOU SAID, but it's not WHAT YOU MEANT.""

Precisely.  A large part of reading comprehension is figuring out what is being suggested, not merely the literal words used.

&gt;And again, saying that some Muslim girls might fabricate tales of assault, etc. rather than face their parents is ""absurd"". 

That isn't what you said.  Nobody questions that some Muslim girls might do that.  Hell, nobody questions that some girls period might do that.  What you actually said was:

&gt;ask why some girls in Islamic families might be **more** inclined to fabricate stories of attempted rape, assaults, hijab cutting, whatever

It's implied that apparently muslim girls are *more* likely to do this, but no evidence of such is presented.  So I'm to ask why a situation that we have no proof exists might exist?  Definitely a fruitful use of my time.

I'm sorry that one teenage girl doing something idiotic wasn't enough to suddenly throw my entire belief system into question.  

&gt;Why don't you use your clearly massive intellect and search google.

Oh ho ho! So clearly the reason that I disagree with you is that I haven't done enough research, not that you came onto a sub dedicated to political debate and presented precisely zero evidence to support your claim?

&gt;It probably does. All I'm seeing in this subreddit is people like you throwing insults around, being incredibly ignorant of the reality of the matter, and circlejerking your own bias.

Disagreement is not ignorance.  If you'd like to change people's minds, perhaps present something other than smugness?

&gt;Weird how you can't see that leftists breaking subreddit rules and downvoting someone who calmly and neutrally states to hold the pitchforks because it may be a hoax could imply that maybe hoax crimes are slightly more common than leftists typically think.

What?  So your argument is

1) People are dicks on the internet,

2) Therefore, leftists are wrong.

You might be missing a few logical connections there."
487,dsvlh33,"You're all over the place. This thread is about a London school not Muslim countries or the rest of the world. 

You also said 'Muslim women are brainwashed from their birth to wear hijabs'. Now you are going back on that statement and contradicting yourself. 

I never denied some Muslim girls are forced to wear the hijab or burka. On the other hand, you said all Muslim women are essentially forced to wear the hijab, which is evidently bullshit of the highest degree, and then you went on to track back. 

Stop talking about things you have no idea about, and stop making sweeping statements like that in the future, ok?"
488,dp9luan,"I am not naive enough to believe bans on hijab or other religious coverings are rooted in concern for women's rights. I also think that, at least in America, banning such garments would be very against the first amendment. Especially since non-religious headscarfs (like the kind my grandmama wore, or a nun's habit) are allowed, it just seems silly to ban it. I don't really consider it any of my business but I do believe in first amendment rights to freedom of worship. 

I think liberal feminism DOES have a problem naming and identifying the oppression of women and girls in the context of Islam. Ayaan Hirsi Ali's writing opened my eyes to the fact that a lot of the liberal feminist positions on this are simplistic and sometimes damaging. 

To be honest, after reading her work I was humbled and felt compelled to step back and acknowledge that I don't know much about it. It made me want to be exposed to a wider variety of Islamic/Arabic feminist thought, and reminded me not to let liberal feminism be my entire frame of reference. 

Not everything is my fight. But I do stand firm in the idea that it's not okay to violate a woman's first amendment rights to freedom of religious expression when it harms nobody. Telling women that they CAN'T cover up any part of their body seems wrong (outside of specific circumstances, like needing to be identified). I do understand that many young Muslim girls are forced to cover, and that sucks so bad. I don't know how to handle that, other than that I think it's very important for our society and culture to be able to provide as much opportunity as possible for her not to need to depend on her father or husband (as with all women)."

When Muslim girls are given this doll, I am sure the parents will say something like, ""Look. This Western made doll has accepted the hijab as Islamic modesty. If they accept it, so shall you"". It only enforces an idea that shouldn't questioned.

 It is a common known pattern that young muslim girls are  free of hijab until they start to grow more feminine, then, that is when their lives turn into a prison hell. You can make excuses. You can balk and refuse to see it because you wish to uphold some principle of tolerance...and that is admirable, but there is an eventuality of reason where the religious usage of headcoverings are concerned; they are indicative of highly oppressive patriarchal views of women and female sexuality. A muslim woman's headcover is always a badge that she is of age to be seen sexually arousing. There's no going around that."

Nothing is stopping a Jew from eating a big piece of pork, they won't get beaten up (most likely). They do it because they respect the customs of their faith... How is hijab any different? 

For the record, I know many muslim women who don't bother with hijab, and very few people give them grief for it apart from the - ironically if you beleive it's male oppression - old gossipy women.

But I don't relate to hijabi influencers because they seem so shallow. Majority of their videos are about makeup, fashion, their weddings, etc. Like sure all of that stuff is good but why can't they call attention to real things. They have these amazing platforms and they don't use it to call attention to things that matter. If anything they just perpetuate the idea that a Muslim woman's value is limited to her beauty, her fashion sense and relationship status. Disappointing. Young girls look up to these influencers and all they learn is how to contour their face perfectly and where to buy the cutest clothes. What a shame.

But the Saudis are Muslims too. Muslim Nazis, basically. ISIS, same deal. Not allies of the left.

It was so thoughtful and it was the first time I had heard a somali young boy I knew care about women's treatment. It actually made me pause and I had to agree with him. My cousin always says she wants a boy and I see her being more doting on her sons than her daughter.

I would be super careful with this. I love my religion and I love my partner but you should never convert in order to meet someone who fits the archetype of the typical Muslim man. Would you be comfortable with praying five times a day? Would you be happy circumcising your son when he’s born, as is tradition for boys born into a Muslim household? Would you observe the fast during Ramadan, or cover your hair full time outside the house, or do the pilgrimage?

For most traditional, religious men, this is what they’d expect from a Muslim wife. 

If you were to stay true to yourself and seek the type of Muslim man who would date you as a non-religious person, you might find that you’ll end up with the more relaxed type who wouldn’t make you follow his religion as someone religious might expect you to. 

The other thing is, it’s all fun and games when he makes you feel like the woman and he makes you see that he’s the man, but that’s also risky. In some (isolated, but still very real) cases the misogyny in our community is so rampant that it goes beyond traditional gender roles and past the point a lot of women are comfortable, for example not allowing you any male friends, having you dress a certain way in public or change the way you speak/ the times of day you go out, etc etc... all of these might be what you’re looking for but please, tread with caution. 

The other thing I want to say is, a lot of Muslim men are brought up to view women as untouchable and valuable and might take issue with harming you even in the bedroom. One of the first things young Muslim boys are taught is “heaven is at your mothers feet” and are brought up seeing women on a real pedestal. This isn’t true for all households, but it was for mine and my husband’s, and it took a lot of discussion and getting used to for him to be comfortable with his sadistic side and an overall SM relationship. 

Basically, what I mean to say by ways of this essay of a comment, is TREAD WITH CAUTION. your experience sounds incredible, but if you go exclusively seeking Muslim men because you had this amazing experience with this amazing man, you’re likely going to wind up disappointed. That’s not to say it can’t work because it’s worked for you before, and it’s worked for me, but definitely tread with caution. Stereotyping usually leads to disappointment. I wouldn’t convert just to find a certain type of man. The right type of man for you will find you and accept you for everything you are without having to change yourself. "
512,dw0tujt,"It's untrue that the Muslim women stuck with these men are treated chivalrously. Their religion doesn't stop Muslim men from raping Muslim women and girls. They don't believe it's possible for men to rape their wives, so they do that without even considering it could be wrong. Muslim girls are subjected to FGM, child marriage, and other forms of torture as well. What happened here was clearly a crime motivated by religious, racial, and sexist hatred, but it's false to imply that Muslim women are protected from these men's hatred of women.  

Your point that we shouldn't focus on the larger picture of Muslim men's misogyny because it distracts from the details of these systemic crimes is one thing, and you have some good points, but I can't ignore the implication here that Muslim men treat Muslim women well.

514,e9bkdqc,"You kinda are arguing that they are. Why would you mention about these resentments if the government is not being oppressive so to speak.

And, I don't really think they care much about free speech. Historically, they never had one so they don't know to want something they never really had. Also, the Uyghurs has a bad stereotype in China so akin to Christian/conservative Americans hoping that the Muslim Americans are deported from the US, the Chinese populace also probably would not care of the existence of the concentration camps.

Politically motivated kidnappings and killings is an example of corruption but as long as the Chinese feel the government's social contract is still there and looking out for their general well being, they will continue falling in line. 
"
515,dwhuc79,"What does it mean to be a “secular Jew”? Many “secular Jews” still celebrate some Jewish holidays, for instance. They may light candles on Hanukkah or fast on Yom Kippur. Let’s secular to mean one of two things: 1) either not believing that religious law is binding, or 2) not believing the Holy Books are literally true. 

Pew has done two big surveys of American Muslims, one in 2007, one in 2011. Here’s [the more recent one](http://www.people-press.org/2011/08/30/muslim-americans-no-signs-of-growth-in-alienation-or-support-for-extremism/). It’s mostly not about religious practice or beliefs. 

&gt;Many Muslim Americans are highly religious: 69% say that religion is very important in their lives, and about half (47%) report at least weekly attendance at a mosque for prayer. Similarly, about half (48%) say they make all five salah prayers daily, and another 18% report making at least some salah daily.

&gt;By these measures, Muslims in the U.S. are about as religious as Christians in the United States: 70% of Christians say that religion is very important in their lives and 45% attend services at least weekly according to recent surveys by the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press.

&gt;Overwhelming numbers of Muslim Americans believe in Allah (96%), the Prophet Muhammad (96%) and the Day of Judgment (92%). Yet the survey finds that most reject a dogmatic approach to religion. Most Muslim Americans (57%) say there is more than one true way to interpret the teachings of Islam; far fewer (37%) say that there is only one true interpretation of Islam. Similarly, 56% of Muslim Americans say that many different religions can lead to eternal life; just 35% say that Islam is the one true faith that leads to eternal life.

Things like kosher observance and Shabbat are key areas where I’d divide “religious” from “secular” Jews. That’s often the dividing line in Israel (there is also a third category, “traditional”, who keep some degree Shabbat and kosher, but normally not completely).  What are the equivalents in this survey? 

Daily prayer (salat) is not the worst starting point. It is considered  We might say that 48% are “religious”, 18% are “traditional”, and the rest are “secular” (the full report says 25% pray less often than once a day and 8% never pray). Likewise 47% of American Muslims go to religious services weekly, which isn’t too far from the 45% of American Christians who go to services weekly. However, only 11-14% of Jews go to services one a week according to [a 2013 Pew survey of Jews](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/chapter-4-religious-beliefs-and-practices/). Unfortunately, the Pew surveys of American Jews and Muslims grouped the other categories differently (for the Muslim survey, monthly and yearly are together and seldom and never are together, for the Jewish survey, a few times a year and seldom are together, while never is its own category) so you’d have to download the data yourself to actually make the comparison. Both surveys independently compare their group to Christians, and it’s clear that Muslims attend services roughly at the same rates as US Christians, and Jews attended services considerably less. 

Unfortunately, as I mentioned, the Muslim survey didn’t ask questions about religious practices, like fasting during Ramadan or keeping halal or avoiding alcohol. The previous survey did, however, and I think something like 77% of American Muslims said fasting during Ramadan was important to them (53% of American Jews fasted on Yom Kippur, including 22% of American Jews who said they had “no religion”).

I don’t know what the survey landscape is in other countries, however, except Turkey. There, secularism is often measured by whether women cover their hair or not. In the last big survey on the topic that I know about, by University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, and asked about hair covering in sort of a weird way. See [here](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/08/what-is-appropriate-attire-for-women-in-muslim-countries/). 32% of respondents preferred the picture of an uncovered woman, which is roughly in-line with the percentage of Turkish women who don’t cover their hair in other surveys (like Israel, in Turkey there is a difference between the religious, who wear the “türban”, and the more “traditional”, who wear a variety of head-coverings—this survey doesn’t seem to capture that difference very well). I think this isn’t the best indicator for religious beliefs because it tends to be caught up in ideas of modesty and how to behave in public space and what it means to be safe in public. For many, it’s clear that this is a matter of custom more than a matter of religion (at least, that’s what some of the research in Turkey indicates). 

Pew does have a 2012 survey looking at the adherence to the Five Pillars of Islam among Muslims. You can was the [“Religious Commitment” section here](http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-2-religious-commitment/). Notice that these numbers range from 30% in a place like Kazakhstan (which was for generations part of the Soviet Union) to nearly a 100% in many other countries. It’s even 84% in Turkey, where you will have women with uncovered hair who fast, for instance. I won’t go point by point, but this may be the most useful survey for you to actually make your comparisons. The data is very mixed, however. For example, people in Bangladesh pray about the same about as people in Turkey, but Turkey by most other measures has a larger secular (in this sense) population than Bangladesh. Clearly, certain acts have local shades of meaning. 

Without getting too far into the he same is, incidentally, true of Judaism: secular Israeli Jews tend to be less engaged with religious activities than secular American Jews, but yet a higher proportion of them fast on Yom Kippur—roughly 45% of self described secular Israeli Jews fast on Yom Kippur, compared to 22% of “Jews of no religion”, but also compare that to 76% of Reform Jews (most Reform Jews would self-describe as “secular Jews”, I suspect). On the other hand, [29% of self-described secular Jews in Israel light Shabbat candles](https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/1.5112262), which is higher than American Jews overall—the American numbers are 23% overall, 10% Reform, 6% Jews of no religion. It can be hard to compare specific things across contexts because the acts may represent “secularness” or “religiousness” differently. I’ve had friends who’ve moved from one context to the other and they tend to have a lot to say about the differences of what “secular Jews do” in the two contexts.

Changing gears, on the very specific topic of Sharia, and specifically whether the punishments specified in fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) like cutting off the hands of thieves should be applied in the present day, I have a long post on a global survey (again by Pew) on that subject [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3vmoea/what_exactly_is_sharia_law/). (See also /u/CptBuck’s critique of my larger argument, but not the survey numbers, in the same thread.)

In general, beyond these surveys, there are countries where there are sizeable populations of “secular Muslims” who celebrate holidays and might even believe in God, but wouldn’t necessarily go in for “all that other stuff”. There are many in post-Communist Muslim majority countries (Albania, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, etc.) and a few other countries (especially Turkey, Tunisia, Lebanon), and fewer elsewhere. The data from Africa is interesting (look at Tanzania in this [this survey](http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/gsi2-chp1-3.png)) for instance, but I wonder if it’s the same sort of thing we’d associate with “secular Jews”—I’m honestly not sure. Muslims in an immigrant context, i.e. in Europe and America, generally seem to be secular Muslims than the immigrant sending countries they or their ancestors came from. This is probably both selection (more religious people probably tend to stay home, less religious people tend to want to emigrate—up through WW2 there was a similar trend in Jewish communities) and the effect of immigration context (i.e. assimilation/integration). Again, though, how many “secular Muslims” there are probably depends in part on how you define the secular in secular Muslims or secular Jews. 

In sum, by my call, I’d say in many post-Communist contexts (Albania, Bosnia, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, etc), secular Muslims are likely the majority or close to it. In a few other places (Turkey, Lebanon, Tanzania, etc), a smaller minority in other countries (Jordan, Pakistan, Bangladesh), and effectively non-existent as a social category in many others (Saudi Arabia, Senegal, etc).  "
516,dhl9evi,"&gt;(I will admit that by American standards all the situations you have outlined do constitute oppression.)

And those are similar or exactly as same as the situation Muslim Americans face in America today - we are violating the rights of Americans in this very country and yet the social narrative of the country is decidedly *against* Muslims. Blind hatred of Muslims literally means we've turned a collective blind eye to the many forms of oppression Muslim Americans are subjected to by our fellow Americans - often through the government. Our fellow citizens' awareness needs to be raised about these problems of islamophobia.

&gt;Islam is a form of oppression.

That's a highly biased opinion, and unfairly so because it is not objectively true. 

Every single retrogressive practice of Islam is found in many other religions, but they are *not* seen as an ""oppressive"" force. Take beating of women if they decline sexual satisfaction, for instance - Hinduism and Islam both have that belief. However, only Islam is vilified. Why? Because of fundamentalist christians' agenda against Islam. They obsessively produce false stories (sometimes masquerading as ""news"") that are designed to misinform people about Islam or selectively portray it as a negative belief system.

The truth is that Islam preaches that their god is ""the most merciful and benevolent"" - just like Christians do with Christ. You may hear about hand cutting of thieves, etc., but your bias is *so* selective that you pick the *one* line out from an entire book and ignore 99% of text. 

What will tell you the nature of any religion? One line, probably taken out of context, or the overwhelming majority of the text? Even if you think that one line is enough to condemn the religion, the fact is that you cannot claim you are making sound judgment without knowing 99% of the religious text.

If you read the other parts, you would surely come across Islam's socialist message of taking care of orphans, the elderly, etc. That is, Muslims are obliged to pay a religious tax that pays for the most vulnerable and needy in their society. So when you make your judgment against Islam - be fair and at least acknowledge the positive aspects of Islam, even if you deem it ""an oppressive faith nonetheless"". 

And maybe if you read the rest of the text, you would be further surprised about how much you didn't know about Islam, because your ears have been filled with nothing but mud slinging efforts by the religious right in this country.

At the end of the day, you must ask yourself what the right thing to do is:

- Is it right for the government to violates our Constitution by discriminating against Muslim Americans? 

- Is it right to contribute to a negative narrative against Muslims, that enables the Islamophobes in our midst (especially in the government) to discriminate against our fellow Americans who happen to be Muslim?

- Why are you so hell bent on condemning Islam that you have not said a peep about the horrible acts of Islamophobia committed against Muslims in America, such as shooting their mosques, setting fire to their places of worship, ripping off 8 year old girls' scarves, etc? Why are you instead focused on how so-called ""Islamic governments"" in foreign nations doing horrible things to their own people - while ignoring our own ills?

Didn't Jesus say ""Let him who is without sin cast the first stone"" ? Or did he say ""Let's throw stones at those foreign countries over there too!"""
517,emjmoez,"&gt;All religions are eroded by public schools.

Public school is funded by the government. So, it will preach what the ruling elite wants you to believe. Still, it is not almighty.

The public schools in Europe have been preaching to immigrant North African and Turkish kids against Islam since the 1960ies. They have had the opportunity to convert almost three generations of pupils out of Islam. I do not think that anybody believes that it has worked. For example, Muslim girls are more likely to wear headscarves today than they were in the 1960ies.

If public schools manage to defeat Christianity but not Islam, it certainly says something about the relative strength of both religions.

Religion is all about being stubborn and being patient. [The most intolerant wins.](https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#.z5ry4bucq)"

Uh huh.  So the Nazis were Muslim?  The communists of Russia and CHina?  The Khmer Rouge?  India?  South America?  I've never seen someone so willingly blind to a vast majority of history.

&gt;Never mind that these issues are no better in those Muslim states that were never colonised by the British, or even those who were never subjected to any sort of meaningful European yoke. 

Like who?  Which part of the Muslim world today was never ruled by a European Empire?  Go ahead and list one, I'll wait.

&gt;Muslims in the West are democratic precisely because they live in democratic societies.

So clearly Islam isn't to blame.  

&gt;They are simply operating within the parameters of a society that evolved without Islam.

other than northern Europe, that's a brazen lie.  Muslims were literally expelled by Christians from Europe as their power grew.  the fact that Europe has been without Muslims who've lived there for centuries proves my point more than it does yours.

525,erufr2o,"This is a very insightful read on the problems associated with the Abrahamic faiths. Interestingly, they all struggle with fundamentalist movements. There has been some [good sociological work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalism_Project) on the subject, I suggest reading the whole series of books: [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fundamentalisms-Comprehended-Fundamentalism-Project-Paperback/dp/0226508889/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Fundamentalism+Project&amp;qid=1561276618&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1) and [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fundamentalisms-Society-Reclaiming-Education-Fundamentalism/dp/0226508811/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=Fundamentalism+Project&amp;qid=1561276682&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-4), for example.

The research suggests that all of the Abrhamic faiths have large communities of fundamentalists who all share the characteristics arising from religious supremacism: paranoia endogamy and violence.

In the UK, it has teken several generation for the problem to evolve into its current form, but large communities of Muslims there have created highly segregated communities which are so alienated from the communities in which they live, and the religiously different people who live near them are so hated by theses large communities of endogemous Muslims, that [sex grooming gangs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45918845) (where non-Muslim girls are groomed for sexual exploitation) are becoming a ubiquitous feature of these communities.

For you to base your opinion on people because of political motives is absurd and shortsighted.  Islam is fluid.  It becomes like the culture it's a part of.

&gt;Also, it’s right in the text that Muslims ought to kill and conquer.

except that it isn't.  NOt even close. and if you post a single line as ""proof"", I am going to make you look very stupid, because I'm actually educated on this topic, and I've seen this tactic used before.  

&gt;There has been a reformation in Islam, as in a getting back to scripture.

Wrong, the reformation is based on the tribal interpretations of the Arabian peninsula.  and even that, based on the Sunni systems, which were corrupted shortly after the prophet died by the Ummayad dynasty, which impose political philosophies and ideals into Islam, and fabricated many hadith used by the Saudis to give rise to political Salafi-Islam.

&gt;people are just getting back to the basics and roots of the religion.

You don't know what that even is.  You barely understand the basic texts of the religion.  you aren't qualified to dictate what the roots are.  "

People are products of their environment, and Islam is a very fluid religion.  The Elite in SOME places in the middle east use Islam to solidify and centralize their power, while external forces tend to be aggressive toward independent and progressive Muslim countries.  For example, Syria has a secular constitution, and Obama and the Saudis tried to destroy that.

What governments and politicians do does not answer for Islam.  yes, they corrupt Islamic institutions, because that's what happens when you combine law and religion.  But the Quran itself says 2 important things ignored by these governments, clergy and sometimes, people:

Surah Al-Baqarah [2:256] 

""There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.""

Second:

Surah Al-Kafirun [109]

""O disbelievers!
I worship not that which ye worship; 
Nor worship ye that which I worship. 
And I shall not worship that which ye worship. 
Nor will ye worship that which I worship. 
Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion."""

560,dlhl8ra,"&gt;When asked whether targeting and killing civilians can be justified to further a political, social or religious cause, 84% of U.S. Muslims say such tactics can rarely (8%) or never (76%) be justified, while 12% say such violence can sometimes (7%) or often (5%) be justified.

&gt;This question was designed to be asked of the general public as well. Compared with the U.S. public as a whole, Muslims are more likely to say targeting and killing civilians for political, social or religious reasons is never justifiable (76% vs. 59%). Roughly equal shares of Muslims (5%) and Americans as a whole (3%) say such tactics are often justified (the difference between these numbers is not statistically significant).

More of the quote from pew. Notice the difference between Muslim Americans and Americans as a whole who say it is *often* *justifiable* is *insignificant*, meaning that stat is virtually the same for both Muslim and non-Muslim Americans, while *LESS* Americans as  a whole would say it's *NOT* justifiable than just Muslim Americans, meaning non-Muslim Americans are statistically more ok with the idea of killing civilians for a (subjectively ""good"") cause than Muslim Americans. How awkward."

Tito and Albrecht fought against soldiers who had invaded their country. You're advocating violence against people who think differently than you do.

So, It doesn't logically follow that we need to ban Muslim immigrants from the USA. In fact, the first Muslim elected the USA federal government publicly stated that he supported gay marriage. 

It doesn't follow that, because there are places that have Arabic street signs that we need to stop the 'Islamic takeover' of the USA. You should visit the Chinatown in Philly or DC sometime. 

And it doesn't follow that we need to start talking about how we're going to start carrying concealed guns for the inevitable day we're going to have shoot a Muslim.
