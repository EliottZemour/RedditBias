Muslim women are finally set free from triple talak and this is you call discrimination? On the contrary, Modi Govt has been discriminatory against Hindus, Christians, Sikhs for not offering them same opportunity as preferential treatment Muslims get.

Article 370 integrated Kashmir into India allowing Indian laws to apply there. Oh wait you are fine with so many laws including rape laws which weren't applicable to Kashmir? Effect of it are visible in form of investment that is being put in Kashmir for development. Millions have been invested in Kashmir for development but people like you WANT MY KASHMIRI BROTHER AND SISTER TO SUFFER. DEVELOPMENT OF KASHMIR MEANS YOUR PROPOGANDA MACHINE ENDS AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE. You want young kids to join terrorist organisation and kill their fellow Kashmiri, kill fellow Indian, kill kids. Because that suits your goal. You don't want Kashmir to progress. You want Kashmir to burn and any thing done for betterment of Kashmir will be a sore thumb to you."
1,fzhowmg,"I think it is partly out of fear. Western society supports such people, and as a result muslim women are often not listened to. Exmuslim feminists spread so much propaganda and fake news that a muslim women can barely even exist without being told by ignorant atheists that she is being oppressed. 

It’s especially hard to go back on things you have been taught your whole life, specifically things like “all muslims are terrorists” and “all muslim women are oppressed and long to be atheist”. I can speak from experience as someone who was raised in a atheist household that there is ALOT of things that I was taught growing up that turned out not to be true.

I think what we need is for religion to be taught in public schools as a subject, or atleast a branch of a certain subject. We can address such problems in childhood, and teach the true Islam, not the stuff that exmuslim feminists spit out. Not only would it debunk alot of misconceptions and assure that children don’t grow up to be so hateful, but it might encourage some children to be interested in joining Islam. This might also help some of the kids whose parents twist Islam and use it to manipulate their children. Of course there will always be hateful people who want to give Islam a bad name and change it, but educating the newest generation might help with changing that."
2,fziz3ct,"Oh you can look how terrorized the muslims are:

• They can vote, express their opinions freely and are seen equal to other parts of population in the eyes of law.

• They are able to follow their religion and live in society with full freedom.

• Many of these brave soldiers who are hunting those coward terrorists are themselves Muslim. [ Indian Military do not ask for religion during admission. ]

• Muslim women are thanking Modi government for criminalising ""Triple Talaq"" due to which they are now able to live with dignity and without any fear if their husband leaving them by simply saying ""Talaq Talaq Talaq"".

3,fvz1q8l,"You know you're 9% european, point it out, and then say l judge people by race and not you. He wants to be seen as a male like his friends with the same attributes and not judged by his dna. They do see him for that. You then says he needs to understand that people prefer others that are similar to themselves. If that's not seeing the world racially what is it? He needs to accept that they don't want his kind, can be racist, and move on. Move on from 90% of people automatically being prejudiced against him in dating and rejecting him for being Indian? He shouldn't be hurt? It's not normal to feel self hate when people act carefully towards you? You're not normal or healthy if you think a person should be able to brush that off. It's not normal. How do you feel about the riots happening? Why aren't you put there telling black people to brush off their oppression and be happy with the status quo? The hatred and systemic racism is the same, but no one is trying to kill him. If a black man is depressed by the situation is he wrong? No, he's not wrong. He's not lacking confidence and he's not being dramatic because racism hurts. You would never say that, but you're okay saying it to OP without knowing him. You can say people prefer those similar to themselves and then say he's not facing a racial problem, but if he is then he needs to accept it and be grateful for what he has now. You assume he isn't grateful for what he does have now. I don't see you commenting that to black people. Black people are being openly lynched, but why the riots? Why can't they be grateful to not be slaves and be happy with that? Why can't they be grateful to be in the employment and housing markets instead of talking about the inequality? Why are they complaining about the justice system when before they couldn't use it? Should they be grateful for what they have and not worry about the rest? 

Should l be grateful that Arab Muslim women are usually not forced into marriage or given away now? Should l be grateful that there's laws against spousal abuse and marital rape even when it's not punished? Should l be grateful to be seen as a terrorist for believing in God? I guess l should be grateful to not be seen as property by some people. Maybe OP should go get an arranged marriage in India where he knows nothing, she most likely has no real choice, and they can be similar in only racial background. Go tell those girls they should be grateful. These things are real. Women are abused daily from situations like these, but we should be grateful too. Now it's only our families that kill us instead of outsiders too. You must live a very privileged life. Good for you. I do mean that. I am happy that you don't face those issues that you can't be grateful for in life, but you know absolutely nothing of how many others live. It is incredibly arrogant for you to say that. I won't respond again. You want to be right and justify racist acts. You are free to do that, but l won't listen again. You're a hypocrite to complain of racial injustice in other forums and tell OP he should accept it for himself."
4,fw1ph09,"* points to comments* Guys....what the hell?

1) Hope none of those groups that are trying to get our page taken down sees some of y'alls vitriol.

2)  I still love y'all. 

For +25 years we've had the ""Muslim bad"" narrative beaten into our society, so can understand. 

We literally keep to ourselves but have armed guys who coat their bullets in pigs blood come to our masjids (mosque) telling us to go home and we don't belong here, but we're the terrorist. (They coat them in pigs blood because they think if you shoot us with them, we'll go right to hell.) 

We literally...don't....do.... anything but you hate us. Once again, that's fine but gezzz. How are you gonna say Muslim women are oppressed, then go around and make a sport of trying to hit us with cars (That's a thing.), call us nasty names in front of our kids, and do other nasty crap? 

I've been burped in my face (at Ikea), someone tried to hit me TWICE (Both times Whole Foods), and a guy whipped his dick out and said some nasty shit to me because I was a Muslim woman walking down the street (BASKIN ROBBINS). 

Sorry for the rant. Just leave us alone, you can make fun of us online...but please don't make fun of us IRL in front of the kids. Don't know at what point someone makes that jump, but just...control yourselves in public. Respect everyone's personal NAP."
5,fr0b2f3,"No, it's not. Muslims are human beings, just like you or I, and deserve to be treated as such. While no doubt there are some Muslim terrorists who kill on the basis of religion, the same can be said for many other religions, including Christianity. Similarly, you can't blindly generalise that all Muslim women are treated 'like shit', because most of them aren't. There are a lot who are treated poorly of course, but Islam as a whole supports a form of gender equality, in which the woman controls the household and the man controls the outside world - although these roles are not strictly adhered to by most, only in the most religious of Muslim groups. Your opinion is completely invalid, you obviously know nothing about Islam and frankly you sound like a bigoted piece of shit."

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;All I'm saying is that you shouldn't be racist towards all Muslims just  because some of their number engage in actions like that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Once again, these atrocities are not widespread - they occur in the  small minority of Muslim groups.  This is the same everywhere. You are  bigoted because you judge Islam as a whole knowing barely anything about  it - except the crimes committed by a few of its followers.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In some parts, again (hopefully this goes into your abnormally thick  skull) Islam is used as justification for horrific acts, like stoning.  However, this is not common, nor endemic to Islam - think of the rape of  choirboys by Church officials etc. For example, many other groups have  committed atrocities and are not discriminated against in the same way.  You don't automatically assume every German person is a neo-Nazi. Thus,  you can't judge Islam by the actions of a few. Again, I am not defending  this in any way, obviously, rather pointing out that you are bigoted  mong.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm defending Muslims who do not commit these crimes, as I have always  said. Obviously I do not condone stoning or other such crimes.

&amp;#x200B;

sorry, do you mind highlighting when u/aulusfan22 said that ""But a couple of comments ago you were defending how they treat women so once again what happened"". afaic I don't see where they mentioned that any time within your discussion?"
7,frrc35w,"&gt;The Muslim women in the west are not living what most Muslim women experience.

I don't know if you forgot but the context of this conversation is the burqa ban in France

&gt;I can’t wait for this sub to defend Klansmen walking around in white robes and hoods like it’s no biggie just part of their beliefs.

1) The Klan outfit is designed to intimidate others through invoking terroristic violence, not just be a garment of ""modesty""

2) something can be a ""biggie"" and part of their beliefs. You can challenge their beliefs.

3) challenging beliefs doesn't need to be done by fining the people you are supposedly trying to protect. Muslim women are literally taking cases to the European Court of Human Rights to fight for their right to wear what they want, and you're saying ""no, this is your your own good, the government needs to control what you where for your own good"" fuck off with the klan comparison."

You’re losing the argument so now you’re trying to blame it on “but Muslims bad!!!!!”. Just stop can’t be bothered to argue about Sweden becoming an Islamic state lol no thanks I’m good. The young generation of immigrants are way less religious as their previous generation. So that’s gonna fix itself don’t lose sleep over it. Most Muslim women are getting into work so it’s not realistic to believe that they’ll pump out 6 children each in the future. I would advise not misinterpreting more studies as they are not conclusive enough to validate the statement that “Sweden will become Muslim”. But I’m not here to argue that, nor do I care about your opinion as I’ve read more than enough about that shit when I too was an ignorant right winged guy.

The police did give him an escort, but if you watched the video you don’t really hear the policeman say anything at all really. We didn’t really hear or get any film of anyone being aggressive, you can see popele chill causally in the background. There’s no gangs there in the picture, and no one came up to them and asked why they’re filming. They talk loudly about how someone was robbing stores earlier lol with a camera in the worst part of town too. What did they expect the police to think would happen as the people who did it was probably there. Like use your brain, you can go through that place fine. I’m yet to see someone go through Rinkeby with a hidden camera🤷🏼‍♂️ And during the video the guy says that there was no problem in the other “no go zones” as there aren’t any. He said the police man also said that there aren’t any no go zones, but there are places they need to be secured as they’re more dangerous. Does this sound like Chicago? Which was my fucking point? As it’s not a fucking warzone fr. even this stupid kidnapping is nothing compared to the US, where recently a 19 year old rapper got killed in the hills. It’s not even comparable.

If the video you showed is Sweden at its worse, this is the US on a daily basis: https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/gcmv8x/guys_flexing_on_facebook_live_give_their_location/

You cannot with a straight face say that Sweden is a country in bad conditions, ofc they have an issue, but it’s not a third world country. 

Angry foreigner is a YouTuber, can’t be bothered to watch all his videos. But I’ve seen some of them before, and most of them was just him complaining about Swedish policies that he disagreed with. Some I probably disagree with too, but as I said not my point.

The majority of attacks in Scandinavia is not my Muslim immigrants, it’s more of an equal back and fourth with the right winged populists and the extremists in Islam. Last year in Norway this guy killed his sister (because she was not white and adopted) and tried to shoot up a mosque. So it’s a quite important to not demonise All Muslims and immigrants as they’re normal humans beings.
The people who do commit terrorist acts are people who have fallen out of society and are usually bullied a lot tbh. It’s kind of like a school shooter thing except that’s not how they do it in Scandinavia.

This will probably be my last response as I’m not into this red pill shit, and I’m not racist. I’ve grown up in a multicultural country, and I know that the majority of people leave their differences at the door when they leave the house and go to school etc. This is reality, if you truly believe what you say is true I advise you to visit Norway, Sweden or Denmark one day, and you’ll see that it’s not “sharia law” here. If not, stop worrying about us as we’re completely capable of handling our own issues.

This might be somewhat messy, but I’ve been reading for my exams all day so this is what you’ll get sorry."

&gt;So that’s gonna fix itself don’t lose sleep over it. Most Muslim women are getting into work so it’s not realistic to believe that they’ll pump out 6 children each in the future.

Where had I said that? Stop projecting just because you did believe in some exaggerated bs it doesn't mean that the problem doesn't exist. Pewpoll doesn't assume that they will have 6 kids on average, and the unemployment among Muslim women is high.


&gt; I would advise not misinterpreting more studies as they are not conclusive enough to validate the statement that “Sweden will become Muslim”. But I’m not here to argue that, nor do I care about your opinion as I’ve read more than enough about that shit when I too was an ignorant right winged guy.

I am not right winger, stop projecting. I also didn't misinterpret the study, you are the one that did it to create a strawman argument.

&gt;The police did give him an escort, but if you watched the video you don’t really hear the policeman say anything at all really. We didn’t really hear or get any film of anyone being aggressive, you can see popele chill causally in the background.

We was told that they need to evacuate, either way police wouldn't give him escort if there was no need for it.

&gt;There’s no gangs there in the picture, and no one came up to them and asked why they’re filming. They talk loudly about how someone was robbing stores earlier lol with a camera in the worst part of town too.

You are contradicting yourself.

&gt; He said the police man also said that there aren’t any no go zones, but there are places they need to be secured as they’re more dangerous.

This is what no gone zone means. Nobody was claiming that there are places where you literally can't go.

And that proves what? How is that relevant? So video doesn't count because it is anecdotal, unless it supports your point (even tho you have none as this is jsut whataboutism). Also your video is showing gang violence if you aren't part of the gang it doesn't affect you.

&gt;You cannot with a straight face say that Sweden is a country in bad conditions, ofc they have an issue, but it’s not a third world country.

I am saying that Sweden is heading there, and it happens for obvious reason. This is the point, they are ruining decent country due to ideology that is cancerous in other western countries as well, that is why there is so much talking about it. It is much better, and easier to prevent becoming a shitty country then waiting it will happen.

&gt;The majority of attacks in Scandinavia is not my Muslim immigrants, it’s more of an equal back and fourth with the right winged populists and the extremists in Islam. Last year in Norway this guy killed his sister (because she was not white and adopted) and tried to shoot up a mosque.

The people who do commit terrorist acts are people who have fallen out of society and are usually bullied a lot tbh. It’s kind of like a school shooter thing except that’s not how they do it in Scandinavia.

Pretty sure that they were bullied people in Scandinavia between https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_Sweden 1975 and 2010 but nobody did die in terrorist attacks in 35 years, imagine this 35 into the future, it is as if something got worse.

Also as I had said terrorist attacks are a minor problem in comparison to all the other issues that Muslim bring. They are part of an issue since they effectively silence criticism of Islam but the harm that they do directly is minor in comparison to the overall harm that Islam brings.

&gt;So it’s a quite important to not demonise All Muslims and immigrants as they’re normal humans beings.

I am not demonizing anybody. You are naive to think that Muslims will change if people will not even be able to critize them. The problem is the fucked up ideology that they propagate. Nazis were human beings as well, so what?

&gt;This will probably be my last response as I’m not into this red pill shit, and I’m not racist.

You are amazing. Virtue +10. Also thanks for reminding me that religion is a race. /s

I am also not into red pill bs, and I am not into your wishful unrealistic thinking either. Just because I can see obvious problems with Islam, and the fact that fundamentalism is widely spread among Muslims in Europe (based for example on what they themselves are saying when polled) It doesn't mean that I think that world is controlled by Jews, and that Arabs are genetically inferior. There aren't just those 2 options.

&gt; I’ve grown up in a multicultural country, and I know that the majority of people leave their differences at the door when they leave the house and go to school etc. This is reality, if you truly believe what you say is true I advise you to visit Norway, Sweden or Denmark one day, and you’ll see that it’s not “sharia law” here. 

You think that all muslims will go out forcing sharia law, or they are secularized? You believe in absurd oversimplification of a real world. Heck even they religion tells them to stay low before they become a majority, and to follow law of the land (of course change it when after they will become a majority), but even then they slip when they are polled, also read what ex muslims have to say, they will say different things to westerner, and to somebody who they think is another muslim.

Most people also try to avoid problems they will not say shit that will get them in trouble with his friends of employer, when you were ""red pilled"" where you telling about it to everybody? Would you tell people in your work about how Jews control everything or about other views that you knew aren't tolerated? Where you attacking any non white person that you had seen? If not then why do you expect Muslims to do it?

Anyway this is a pretty good video that explains some nuance in the situation:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jUvvzhMFC0"
12,fj7jjvi,"I can explain it if youre being for real.

The issue is that if 200k people died due to a terrorist attack, the initial concern would be the families, the damage to the city, rebuilding communities and infrastructure, and immediately looking to stop other similar attacks that might be coming soon or being planned.

But these braindead people just see tragedy as a plus or a minus for their worldview. White man does terrorism? Thats a plus for their worldview where white men are evil. Muslim woman does terrorism? Thats a minus for their worldview where muslim women are peaceful.

Nobody ever said this? 

 My example was meant to relate to the airport setting that this situation is based around. As consistently mentioned non citizens people who are inherently less influential than people that are naturalized or born in the country.

&gt;Guantanamo bay housed prisoners of war, which is a totally different legal process and bears no relevance to this incident.

 It had nothing to do with prisoners of war. they never actually flew anyone from the Middle East (or Atleast kept it a major secret)to Guantanamo it was about detaining suspected terrorists you need to do more research.

&gt;believe it is entirely controversial to say that Muslim Americans and non-native Muslims are more likely to end up detained as a terrorist unless you have data to back up the claim that Muslims are detained as terrorists without any evidence against them.

 One of the 1st lines in the Patriot act is that you can detain people without much evidence in the name of national security.

Also I love how you can contribute nothing to the conversation and still expect me to give you sources.

&gt;To do anything otherwise would be a total violation of law.

 I don't know if you're naive or intentionally trying to convey a separate narrative that doesn't exist. This woman was arrested by police officers and will most likely never see serious federal charges. There are reported cases that you can Google of Brown Muslim Americans and especially non citizens being detained purely on suspicion.

 The fact that you don't understand what the Patriot act is or are pretending like you don't means that we have nothing more to discuss if you truly don't understand, do you own personal research and come to your own conclusions.

Are you really asking me to respect a culture (Arab, muslim, Middle East, whatever the hell you want to call it) that it WORLDWIDE KNOWN FOR NOR RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS? that's funny since it fucking sucks to be a woman and being muslim, as long as you live in an arab country of course, and you know why? Because muslim women are NOT FREE, families arranged they wedding just for money and then they have to dedicate their life to give birth to children (because let me tell you, they have never seen a condom in their life) and spend all their life taking care of the family, the house and bearing being treated like a second class human by their ""husbands"" and basically any men alive. A culture where you have to hide yourself under a dirty black cloth just because you'll get killed for showing your face, hair. 

On the other side, I can't recall any recent event where someone killed other person in the name of the christian god or in the name of Yavhé. I just can remember that happening with Islam...what a coincidence. Do you know how many refugees has Poland accepted? 

Let me tell you: ZERO

Do you know how many terrorist attacks has Poland suffered?

Oh yeah, let me tell you again: FUCKING ZERO

What a hell of a coincidence that in the rest of Europe, every country that has taken refugees in have suffered terrorist attacks: France, Spain, UK, Sweden, Germany...

I honestly think that ""religion"" and culture is cancer because they've demostrated through history. 

Do you know who where the ones who sold the most slaves to Europeans during the distribution of Africa? AFRICANS

What are you playing at? These people doesn't respect our way of living and they want to impose they archaic mindset and destroy everything we've achieved after WWII. They should be humble because they are ""accepted"" in Europe (no one really asks us, everything in Angela Merkel's fault) but you know what do muslims teach their kids?

To hate everyone who isn't muslim, to not be good people with them, to assault them. One of the MOST INTOLERANT CULTURES THAT HAD EVER EXISTED AND YOU ARE ASKING ME TOLERANCE. FUNNY THING.

I'll never hide my ideas. I don't like that religion and if I had the chance I would eradicate it from the whole world, or at least from Europe, where I grew up being free and I don't have to obey my husband or my brother while he is fucking one of his 7 wifes, because yeah! so cool men can practice polygamy but women are not even allowed to speak their mind.

17,fauuoqx,"That's not quite the point. People voted for the Tories despite them being, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, elitist, etc all because the other guy was ACCUSED of anti semitism and supporting terrorists despite no evidence to it. 

Ironically the people who will be most worse off because of them voted for them the most

the media during the election was also incredibly biased towards favourable reporting for the Tories and unfavorable for basically everyone else. 

Yes it's not the same as standing up to Hitler and the Holocaust but voting against the Tories is somewhat the modern day equivelant. 

 Especially when you get people like Katie Hopkins telling a Muslim Tory MP that it's not her party any more because she is Muslim and that ""Muslim women are letterboxes"" also the fact farage and Tommy Robinson endorse them too.

19,f8xufdu,"Islamophobia -""dislike of or prejudice against Islam or Muslims, especially as a political force."" 

You're hating on something or someone for what reason exactly? Not all muslims are terrorists, not all muslim women are oppressed and not all muslims are super religious fundamentalists. Spreading hate will just create more problems, you can't dictate who practices what religion and where they practice it, you can't stop things from changing, since the dawn of time people have hated each other, people adapted from one religion to another and hence things changed. Religion is flawed and all religions have and are practicing stupid and awful things. Truth is there are lots of muslims and there are lots of religious people, and alienating or discrimination against them... since when has that worked for anyone? Politicians shouldn't foster hate, divide and conquer doesn't work in the long run and horrible things happen. 

A natural reaction is to fear the unknown. To feel threatened when things are changing. Guess what!? the world is changing people are moving all over the world from one place to the next, people of different colours and of different faiths for whatever reason. Rights and freedoms are for all not a select few people. 

These texts written years and years ago, be it the bible or the Quran, they are old news. Taking it literally is nonsensical. People just believe in their imaginary entities and if they find comfort in this fucked up world with that, let it be. The truth is in our past as humans, we have done a lot of shady and fucked up things, and now...like it was fairly recent that women were allowed to vote or recognized as persons...

So! Why not call it for it what it is... it's not Islam that people fear... it's the fear that more brown and black people will be in your white neighbourhood, that a vast array of ethnicities will hold top positions in companies, that your children will marry a antonio instead of a bobby, the fear is change! and you know what... deal with it... because in like a thousand years from now there will probably be more atheists than all the muslims and christians combined in the world and you will have to accept that change then too..."

Literally zero have talked about muslim men committing the most number of rapes and there being a trend of non muslim women being targeted as a “rape jihad” of sorts. 

No one is talking about the obvious Islamic angle behind these rapes and murders and how non muslim girls are specifically targeted by muslim grooming gangs for rape/exploitation, fully supported by leftists.

This is what is commonly taught in mosques and madrasas. 

More shitty Bollywood movies and documentaries would be made to target Hindus and Sikhs while ignoring islamic rapists who actually commit these crimes completely. Nirbhaya’s rapist was muslim too who was released from jail and awarded a sewing machine by kejriwal

Love jihad is a very real concept where non muslim women are specifically targeted, raped, drugged, trafficked and then killed. 

The real question is, why are leftists and communists and media and Bollywood so interested in denying that love jihad exists and these things happen.

Hold up, that guy was a juvenile right? So under Indian law he was entitled to whatever he got. He didnt get released or get sewing machine because he was a mulla. Its the law. 

&gt;Democracy is useless if this is what it leads, entire ecosystem lying to defend a foreign cult

Democracy is a foreign cult. Early vedic period has records of village level, district and state level democratic gatherings. Before the idea of primogeniture, kings were chosen by sabhas. Guess you need to re-think the validity of your rant.

Woah so much hate. Glad you are in a liberal democracy where your views are protected. 

&gt;ow women must get more rights and need to be more equal.

So there shouldn't be discussions about the obvious regressive and entitled culture propounded by men ( of any and every religion)? Advocating equality between men and women should be subservient to your anti-(fill in the blank) agenda? Nice bud. I am getting Incel vibes from you. 

&gt;Love jihad is a very real concept where non muslim women are specifically targeted, raped, drugged, trafficked and then killed.

Oh yes irrefutable source. Then why in telengana the rapist of 10 year old (whose video of public beating by police was viral) wasnt a mulla, neither 3 out of 4 rapists and murderes of telangana vet were mullas nor in case of nirbhaya.
I guess you need to corroborate your fiction with hardcore facts. I get it this sub reddit is a circle jerk for hate speech and Islamophobia and all that bullshit but buddy atleast give some proof of your claims. Even NCRB doesnt collect data of rapes and assaults against women based on religion, you would need to dive hard to get some irrefutable evidence.

23,famskjq,"Hi, I’m an 18 year old voter from the UK. 

I speak on behalf of the younger voters when I say that I know maybe 3-5 people personally, who have voted for conservatives. Every single one of my friends and people my age went to vote yesterday. Everyone. No one voted for Conservatives.

Jeremy Corbyn is absolutely despised by the older generation of Britain, and adored by the younger/youngest generation. 

I get the whole ‘history’ thing for why local areas don’t tend to vote for a party that has royally fucked them over, though.

I personally don’t understand why people despise Jezza C so much, and I’m asking genuinely, why?

On the “main” issue of the election, he said he is “for what the people want” on leaving the EU. I much rather would prefer my DEMOCRATIC leader to say that they are just a figurehead for what the country actually wants, than decide for himself and try to bulldoze his way though, without proper planning like Boris seems to want to do.

I’m all for leaving the EU if it actually seemed like a good choice, but I hate that I have been lied to, manipulated, and had my intelligence questioned to the extent the Conservative party went to, in this election. It’s absolutely INSANE to elect a leader who has an open history of lying (he was fired as a journalist for lying), lied to the Queen (illegal for politics), unlawfully tried to suspend parliament, and has a massive discriminatory and racist past.

This includes: saying Muslim women are like ‘letter boxes’ and ‘bank robbers’; black people are apparently ‘piccininnies’ who have ‘watermelon smiles’; criticism of single mothers although he went and fucked 2; saying Britain should recolonise some African countries, etc etc

The billionaire-owner media, and “impartial” news companies have wildly lied and engaged in illegal political campaigning too. Why is it that there are hundreds of articles going IN on Jeremy Corbyn for other labour MP’s anti-Semitic views, but almost NO ONE even dared ask a question to Boris the MAN HIMSELF who has a history of prolific racism and anti-demotion, about it?
 The Windrush scandal, the little boy in Leeds General Hospital with pneumonia that slept on the floor, the lying propoganda surrounding that, the EARLY AUTOMATIC RELEASE OF A KNOWN TERRORIST who went on a stabbing spree in London Bridge, where the ‘hero’ was also a murderer who was unsupervised that day. The HEAD of the UK Police came on the NEWS to deeply criticise the insane budget cuts to the policing services that meant there was no one to supervise. GRENFELL. Mental health cuts of millions of pounds yearly. Homelessness rate rises by 10,000 every year. Austerity - independent reports by Royal Society of Medicine investigated and says that ~30,000 deaths have been linked to lack of health and social care services.

I could go on. The Conservative party has had NINE years to decide on, plan, and deliver Brexit. We have had THREE prime ministers in 5 years, and all have been incapable of delivering any of the policies the country voted for. I’m genuinely shocked that people have revoted, considering their history with delivering any of their promises policies. The country is on its fucking knees."

25,exi5y11," In 2007, the organization was named, along with 245 others, by U.S. Federal prosecutors in a list of co-conspirators or joint ventures in a Hamas funding case involving the Holy Land Foundation. which in 2009 caused the FBI to cease working with CAIR outside of criminal investigations due to its designation.

In 2008, the FBI discontinued its long-standing relationship with CAIR. Officials said the decision followed the conviction of the HLF directors for funneling millions of dollars to Hamas, revelations that Nihal Awad had participated in planning meetings with HLF, and CAIR's failure to provide details of its ties to Hamas. During a 2008 retrial of the HLF case, FBI Special Agent Lara Burns labeled CAIR ""a front group for Hamas.” In January 2009, the FBI's DC office instructed all field offices to cut ties with CAIR, as the ban extended into the Obama administration

Federal Judge Jorge A. Solis said that there was evidence to show that CAIR has an association with the Holy Land Foundation, Islamic Association for Palestine, and Hamas. All recognized terrorist groups.

Both cofounder Omar Ahmad and Awad were involved previously with the Islamic Association of Palestine (IAP),[\[132\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_American%E2%80%93Islamic_Relations#cite_note-132)[\[133\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_American%E2%80%93Islamic_Relations#cite_note-133) a group described by the FBI, in 1993, as ""intimately tied to the most senior Hamas leadership."", and participated in a meeting held in Philadelphia on October 3, 1993, with Hamas sympathizers and officials of the Holy Land Foundation (which was designated in 1995 by Executive Order, and later designated in a 2008 court case, as an organization that had raised millions of dollars for Hamas).

The Anti-Defamation League (or ADL) has criticized CAIR's work, saying its position as the ""go to American-Muslim civil rights organization"" is ""undermined by its anti-Israel agenda \[which\]... dates back to its founding by leaders of the Islamic Association for Palestine (IAP), a Hamas affiliated anti-Semitic propaganda organization”.

The ADL also accused the group of hypocrisy in its condemnation of Hezbollah, noting that CAIR ""for many years... refused to unequivocally condemn Palestinian terror organizations and Hezbollah by name”  


Some Muslims criticize CAIR for taking a conservative religious approach on many issues. These critics claim that statements by the organization (for example, that all Muslim women are required to veil) often follow conservative Saudi religious doctrine and do not capture diverse religious perspectives.[\[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_American%E2%80%93Islamic_Relations#cite_note-scr-139)

She also supports the Muslim Brotherhood, something that’s recognized as a terrorist organization, who literally created Hamas. Their members run Hamas and all the founding and top members of Hamas are members of The Muslim Brotherhood. 

&amp;#x200B;

She supports terrorists and terror groups. She supports Hamas and fundraises for them. Hamas is the very group targeting and killing Palestinians. They air networks that are nothing but children’s shows teaching them to kill Jews. All Jews. And if Israel is gone, they still need to take care of all the other Jews and kill them too. She spreads lies and propaganda. She is a Muslim, women of color, and she is still supported by David Duke, the grand wizard of the KKK. That should be a red flag. Her many tweets and comments and interviews spouting anti-semitism is straight from the alt-right. She funds groups that say Israel has no right to exist and bombs them constantly, while stating they will not rest until every Jew in the world is dead. When she propagates that Jews are secretly controlling all the world leaders and then she funds groups spreading the message that Jews are magically tricking the world into believing ""lies like the Holocaust,” it’s insulting.

26,exifspn,"&gt; that all Muslim women are required to veil
So I attempted to find the post where CAIR says this and all I could find was [a post from 2006](https://www.cair.com/a_veil_doesn_t_mean_oppressed) stating 
&gt;""my Islamic religion requires me to dress modestly and hide the contours of my body so as not to attract the opposite sex.""

While this is poorly phrased, it's no more unreasonable than a Jew saying ""my Jewish faith requires me to obey the laws of Kashrut."" It's not a statement of religious policy, it's a statement about one's own interpretation of their religion.


Fundraising for an organization, with ties to an organization, whose founders may have at some point supported some facets of what Hamas was doing ([before](https://www.cair.com/dispelling_rumors_about_cai) Hamas was committing terrorist acts, I'll note) does not impute a desire to support those views. Otherwise, every American who's donated to a political campaign since the '90s could be said to be supporting Al Qaeda and 9/11. Even under the most stretchy definition of support, Omar doesn't support Hamas 


David Duke is a Nazi. Nazis lie. If David Duke is ""endorsing"" a ""Muslim, women of color"" then perhaps we should be inspecting his motives, like, oh dividing American Jews and our Leftist allies. Also he rescinded his endorsement.

Your link doesnt agree with this:

&gt;Regarding population growth, it’s important to note that as the world population continues to soar, fertility rates are highest in specific places–most of Africa, parts of the Middle East, parts of Latin America, and parts of Asia. In fact, by 2050, Africa is set to grow faster than anywhere else: there were 1 billion Africans in 2010, but that number will grow to 2.5 billion by 2050.

Its part of Muslim ideology to have more children, stats prove this:

https://www.jstor.org/stable/25487622?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

&gt;Based on official data on religion, national origin, and other indicators of ethnic origin, Muslim fertility in 13 European countries is higher than that for other women, but in most countries with trend data the differences are diminishing over time. Fertility varies by country of origin of immigrants. Various European survey data show that higher proportions of Muslim women are married and their commitment to traditional family values is greater than among other women. Muslim women are more religious than non-Muslim women and religiousness is directly associated with fertility. Among Muslim women, religiousness and commitment to family values are equally important for fertility, while for non-Muslim women religiousness is much less important.

For me its mostly the ideology itself is a dangerous one. I've studied the Quran so I know firsthand

&gt;But here's the thing... we all have different brains and some people have brains with extremely certain strong cognitive biases, including in group favouritism and predisposition to fear and anxiety.

I dont have predispostion to fear or anxiety and actually have a healthy lack of fear and no anxiety. Also I am able to be objective by considering all angles as well

&gt;You're one of those people. 

Wrong. This is just a wrong assumption

&gt;The system is designed to identify people like you and feed those biases.

I dont need any biases fed because I've already seen what happened to Europe, know people who fled from Germany and Sweden, some who still live there and tell me about the stabbings, rapes, beheadings, shootings, crime rates and so on. I've experienced some of this myself and have had to move. Its more so the other way around.

Proof? Your hate trackers have been debunked dozens of times so those bastards don't count.

&gt; And Hindus are made to feel victims by certain parties for their political gain.

Hindus ARE victims. As are I believe many Muslims. However, only one religion has institutionalized violence, terrorism and hatred for non-believers. And that isn't Hinduism or other dharmic religions.

And do even you sense the irony in your comment? Fucking Muslim women are more violent and hateful than most Hindu men. Go read up on how butchers in parts of Delhi have been actually encouraged and aided by their wives to murder Hindus.

&gt; Do you as a Hindu take responsibility for the present hateful atmosphere of the country?

This is the thing with a lot of Muslims. They feel victimized in every single part of the world. No matter where they are, they always paint themselves as the victims. Bitch, have some shame for once.

You keep peddling the garbage that media feeds you and then act surprised when normal people don't buy it. And then you have the gall to tell others that it's infact Hindus who are being made to feel victimized.

&gt; And some Hindus sympathising with terrorist sadhvi pragya and godse

Who again? Who told you she's a terrorist? Which court of law? You know this is how I know you're full of shit. See this bullshit, /u/RajaRajaC? Stop defending these people.

Even if some people do sympathize with pragya and godse, it's still a speck of dust when compared to Muslims sympathizing with terrorists. It's like your staple diet.

And when someone points out this behaviour, this way of life, stop calling them haters, bigots or what not. Normal humans prefer peace, not violence. Hating violence is but normal human behavior."

So internalised oppression is not a thing now? So, if you asked a black slave in the early 1800s, do you think he would have said ""we're horribly oppressed"" or that ""master is good for us, we have no reason to complain""?

The least reliable source on oppression of muslim women... are muslim people. Stockholm syndrome is a thing, buddy. According to surveys, North Korea is the happiest country in the world. I'm sure you'd agree with thta sentiment, right? Or maybe people are so fucking brainwashed that they don't know what's good for them anymore. 

Also, I love how YOU brought up the oppression of women in the Middle East, where 95% of people are Muslim, but now you're defending Muslims, saying hey don't oppress women. So who's oppressing women in the Middle East? Christian minorities? Give me a fucking break. 

&gt; How about the shooting up of the mosques in America by self-proclaimed Christians? 

What about it? There are self-proclaimed religious extremists in every group. But for SOME reason, Muslims are far more likely to be extremists.

Those are just terrorist attacks - no honour killings, no uncovered women, gays, or adulterers stoned to death, no grooming gangs, no marital rapes, no raping or executing prisoners of war, no torturing infidels. 

These were ALL religiously motivated. Meanwhile not even the Christchurch shooting was religiously motivated. Show me all these Christian terror attacks! Because frankly, I don't see them!

RECOVERING. I'm not going to justify the crusades, they were pointless - but muslims DID start it. 

&gt;The Lords Resistance Army in Africa? 

The best part about this is that it's a bunch of black people. Your ""white man bad"" narrative falls into pieces when the only real christian terrorist group you can think of is comprised of Africans. 

Also, they don't conform to either protestantism, catholicism, and they aren't orthodox either. Basically, they are Christian only in name. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They are all devoutly Christian, or claim to be 

Does the rest of the Christian community condone their action? I am open to admit that there are small muslim subgroups or denominations that are peaceful. I read about one with like, 300000 followers in England that totally rejected the violent parts of the Qur'an. Have at it. The problem is that the largest denominations (sunnis and shias) are adamantily violent. 

&gt; Very Christian of them. 

I love how you acknowledge that this is NOT how Christians behave, proving my point that they are absolute outliers, unlike with muslims. 

&gt;  So true! This is why thousands of people have spent years and years  researching the subject and get PhDs in the history of Islam!  

There really is not much to research on a religious text. it's not my problem if someone wants to waste his life on theology. The words are written plain and simple. 

[http://166.62.117.116/pages/quran/violence.aspx](http://166.62.117.116/pages/quran/violence.aspx)

&gt; The Bible is written plain and simple too, and look at all the hate that it’s been used for 

Yes, that's despite the fact that there is very little evidence of calling for violence in the New Testament. Now imagine if it DIRECTLY advocated for violence! And thats how you get Islam. 

&gt; Please do your research. Another blanket statement. Do they stone  non-believers in Turkey? You should know, as you said they are right in  your neck of the woods. 

Do you even KNOW geography? Fucking idiot. The Ottoman Empire has severely shrunk in size. I feel like you're equally uneducated in everything you say. The last time Turkey neighboured Hungary was in the early 1800s. And no, Turkish do NOT stone people to death, because they are a secular nation, unlike, say, Iran. 

&gt; Turkey is a majority Muslim nation. So where is the Sharia Law? 

There isn't. I never said Islam inevitably leads to sharia law, I said they are prone to it, and if they are allowed to create an echochamber, they WILL instate sharia law."
32,epdhyjw,"Did you know that Muslim *women* are responsible for ~less than 0.5% of acts of terror on American soil in the past 10 years? I know there are hateful ISIS affiliated women and hateful right-wing women, but for whatever reason, women on either side of the equation are just not out there committing actual violent crimes on the scale that their male counterparts are.  (Name any 3 Islamic terrorist incidents or any 3 school shootings and I’d be willing to bet the perpetrators were male. Not a commentary, it’s just true.) I’m not saying go out there and bully Muslim dudes, but it seems insane to me that Muslim women catch the majority of Islamophobic hate when the likelihood that they are are a threat is INCREDIBLY small, even within the already very small chance that any given Muslim (male or female) is a threat."
33,epqdtb8,"The genocide is already happening worldwide, and it's primarily affecting Muslims - and anyone who the racists suspect of being Muslim. Of course people should be critical of Islam, a patriarchal religion, but what is generally called Islamophobia (perhaps the name is misleading) is racism because these people see Muslim-ness as an ethnic or racial category rather than as a religion, just like anti-Semites see Jewishness as racial, not religious. And of course the White nationalists who these women vote for and support are are equally anti-Semitic. 

Muslim women are under threat from hard-line misogynistic repression in Islamic countries, but rape is used as a tool by Islamophobes against Muslim women. It's not just in the West. Islamophobia is a genocidal force in India too. The prime minister, who was just re-elected, was directly responsible for the genocide of more than two thousand Muslims - men, women and children - when he was chief minister of Gujarat state in 2002. Women were gang raped; pregnant women had their babies torn from their wombs - *because they were Muslim*. And what of the female victims of the terrorist attack in New Zealand? I bet these neo- Nazis on GC were cheering when that happened. They will throw any WoC under the bus because their despicable racism. If they don't have solidarity with Muslim women being raped and murdered by Islamophobes, they have no solidarity with any of us.

35,eofpy50,"I preface this by saying I'm an american who wants to live in the UK soon. So I'm by all means fairly ignorant on finer details. But here's my take:

Everyone's worried about acid attacks my dude. That was a thing and it left social scars. You'll have to forgive a bit of paranoia. Again, it only takes one acid attack to make everyone doing this a potential terrorist, forever scaring their records for a meme. That's a terrible thing. Almost as bad as banishing someone far right even if they've changed. People change and should have the liberty to reinvent themselves. As far as I can tell, [Tommy's around a multicultural group these days](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/17/tommy-robinson-election-tour-flags-fights-milkshake-far-right), while most of his attacks seem to be fairly uniform in their appearance: angry white intelligentsia, or angry Pakistani Islamic men. To me it sounds like he's just Islamophobic, and Islam isn't a race so I don't see anything wrong with criticizing it. Religion should be criticized, and archaic beliefs scrutinized. Saying there's a problem with rape in the Islamic community is no more racist than saying there's a problem with pedophilia in the Catholic community.

Now I have no interest in defending someone who I know little about. I'm just an American observer, and that's what I've observed. I don't see any lynchings from Tommy, nor do I see any cars being rid into protesters, nor gunmen slaughtering black churches. Rather I see a multicultural group of people who are concerned with the free pass Islamic men are getting, and Islamic men being angry that they're being singled out, and the occasional angry white intelligentsia looking for a scapegoat. I am ok admitting I might be wrong on this, because I am not well informed. But this is what it looks like to me."

37,elwgin3,"An English translation (google) I edited a bit the places which looked very incorrect but still there could be many places which are not 100% good translations.

Most of Sri Lanka are Sinhalese. The majority of the legislature, legislators and advocates that govern the country are Sinhalese. Then bring the same law to a country and pass it on and pass it on to everyone for surrender. 7% of Muslims live in Sri Lanka. Is it difficult to control it under that law? Without doing that, why asking from Muslims whether they like Burqa, Sharia Laws, and Arava? Would you like to quit them? What do you mean, why? Actually I do not understand. Why wasting time asking these things from Muslims?

As far as I know, there are no Sharia laws in the law of the country. They shout that they are building a Sharia university. Can you build them without UGC? Are Muslims at UGC? Did the Muslims ask such a university? Even if they asked, would we just give ? Who should decide whether to give or not? Who asked for Islamic banks? Did those Muslim banks exist 10/15 years ago? they did not. Did the Muslims not trade in the banks before that? So, who gave permission for Muslim banks to enter Sri Lanka? Can there be an organization that ignores the law in the country? If so, should have act according to the law.

As some suspect, inside the mosque, if people are being taught terrorism, then put CID and find them. If they have sown this kind of terrorism, put them in jail. Is it right to just say mosques engage in terrorist activities and do nothing, just keep blaming only ?

Muslim ministers do not control the entire country. It is being said that Muslim ministers looking after only Muslims, so have come all these problems. How many Muslim ministers are out of the 225 parliamentarians? At maximum 30. Then others?

In the wake of terrorism, Muslims and Muslim religious leaders, informed the authorities responsible and had made them aware. Not only did they get information but they also demonstrated against those terrorists. Is it correct to ask those questions which need to be asked from those authorities(who did not act), from Muslims ?

Is it possible for a normal Muslim citizen to ban everything you say? What is a normal Muslim to do? We can comment, educate our people and educate our leaders. Can we change the country's administration? I remember when IUSF was campaigning against the Sharia university (for the free the education of whole country), Did anyone speak for it? Did not. 

At this moment, the silence of many Muslims was exacerbated by the Sinhalese. But that's mot because of they're supporting this terrorism. Thinking so is. Very few Muslims are extremists. There are many reasons for the silence of others.

70% of Muslims do not get familiar with Sinhala. So they are thinking in Tamil and English

There are many young Muslims outside of Sri Lanka who have no idea what is going on

There are a little others living in the same muslim background. Many people do not brand them as racists. They do not understand that they are mixed up in a community.

The majority of Muslim women are not in the social networks and in the social interaction

There are some people who have been divided into the different races of traditional and cultural things in Islam. They are interlinked.

There's another set who keep silent even if the sky fall down.

Those who do not know what else to do after the government have done thing even when they have given all information about the terrorists.

Those who do not have a VPN

You understand this. Therefore, it is useless to put your anger at the whole society. Some people say that Muslims are terrorists because Muslims are responsible for them. Will they listen to an ordinary Muslim if we try to advice them? With their blood thirstry nature, they might even kill us if we try to advice them.

The Muslim is battered by the war. During the past 30 years of the war, Muslims were killed, beaten, lost their property, orphaned. None of them forgot. The majority of Muslims are listening to the blames they get by people who have given what a minority of Muslims have asked for. At this moment, most people do not understand anything else, except for being silent. That's why they're silent.

The Muslim ministers who are responsible for it laugh off in front of media. Muslims who do not understand even what's exactly going on in the country are being asked all the questions by Sinhalese.

40,ekk2nrz," 

Last weekend the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, described the massacre in Christchurch as the result ‘of failing to root out Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment from our society’. His intention is to crack down on Islamophobia and give it a formal definition. He is right about anti-Muslim sentiment. But he is dangerously, terrifyingly wrong about Islamophobia.

It has become common to hear the New Zealand atrocity described using this word, but it is loaded with sinister implications that the vast majority of well-intentioned people will simply not understand. And the reality is that it plays straight into the hands of the jihadis.

The Christchurch attack was not an act of Islamophobia. It wasn’t a religion that was gunned down in Christ-church, but the followers of that faith. The mass murderer hated Muslims, and wanted to kill as many people like me as possible. He acted from virulent, lethal, anti-Muslim xenophobia — not from Islamophobia. The difference between these two terms is not one of semantics. This is about the fight between mainstream Islam and the jihadist imposter, a fight in which words are weapons.

Islamists deploy ‘Islamophobia’ as a political and judicial shield to protect them and defame their critics. Their creed is Islamism, a modern-day political agenda masquerading as religion. Its artefacts take the form of permanent war with secularism and an obsession with purity as the external symbol of overt religiosity: the untrimmed beards, the women forced to wear the niqab and the abbayah — along with the profoundly undemocratic and un-Islamic concept of blasphemy

These are drawn not from Islam but a 20th-century totalitarianism. The notion of prosecuting blasphemy or even apostasy has no scriptural basis in Islam: while disbelief is mentioned more than 150 times in the Quran, an earthly punishment is not. If indeed defamation of Islam or eschewal of belief in it is a crime, the Quran designates it a matter strictly between the mortal and his Maker. Hardly the scriptural framework for prosecuting Islamophobia.

Centuries of records show hardly any such criminal cases prosecuted by Muslim jurists. Islamic scripture, whether the Quran or the Hadith and related writings do not show a history of Islamophobia either. There is a record of a Christian tried for blasphemy because of insulting the Prophet Mohammed in Damascus in 1293 but he was acquitted by the jurists of the time.

In his masterpiece *Islamism and Islam*, the Damascus-born scholar Bassam Tibi explains how political zealots managed to pass off their inventions as tradition. ‘By presenting themselves as the spokesmen of true Islam,’ he says, they ‘have enabled themselves to defame their critics by the equally invented notion of Islamophobia’. This word, he continues, ‘serves as a weapon against all who do not embrace Islamist propaganda, including liberal Muslims’.

This weapon is all the more potent when in the hands of naive but well-meaning westerners who seem to think they are helping Muslims. The Algerian novelist Kamel Daoud found himself — an Arab Muslim — targeted in this way after the New Year’s Eve sex attacks in Cologne, where gangs of North African immigrants molested women. They had arrived, he pointed out, from ‘an Arab-Muslim world full of sexual misery, with its sick relationship towards women’. For this, he was attacked in *Le Monde* by French intellectuals for ‘feeding the Islamophobic fantasies of a growing part of the European population’, thereby silencing him from opinion journalism and depriving France of important insights from a mainstream Muslim voice.

When Boris Johnson said that those dressed in niqabs looked like letterboxes, he was subjected to a formal investigation by his own party. Did the Conservatives fail to understand that there is absolutely nothing Islamic about the niqab? It is so peripheral to Islam that Muslim women are banned by Islam from wearing it at Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca and the highest religious rite Muslims can perform in their lifetime.

To talk about ‘anti-Muslim bigotry’ or ‘anti-Muslim hatred’ might be clumsy phrase-ology. But if this is what you mean, then these are the words you should use. There is enough of it about. Take Fraser Anning, an Australian senator, who — on official governmental letterhead and within hours of the Christchurch killings — decided to ‘highlight’ the ‘growing fear’ of an ‘increasing Muslim presence’. His clear implication was that all Muslims are inherently a threat. This kind of bigotry is not hard to recognise or condemn. Nor does it require a new law.

All of this matters because, while we’re getting better at thwarting terrorist attacks, we’re still fighting their ideological underpinning. As a secular pluralistic democracy, we have weapons: intellectual scrutiny, critical thinking and above all the insight to command the language of this war of ideas. And to use the word ‘Islamophobia’ when talking about anti-Muslim xenophobia is to use the vocabulary and adopt the rulebook of the Islamists who wish to obfuscate their intent.

Sadiq Khan wants the Tories to define Islamophobia as ‘a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness’. This definition would go down well in any autocratic Islamist regime, as it is so wide-ranging that it could apply to almost anyone or anything — even Khan has been accused of Islamophobia. So the Mayor should be careful what he wishes for. If he gets his way, the jihadis would be delighted. It would be tragic if, in an attempt to protect Muslims, we ended up taking the jihadis’ bait.

41,ekvb5yi,"&gt;If Muslim women are offended over Muslim men being criticized, what's the difference between that and white women being offended by their fellow white men being criticized, speaking purely from the position of protecting women's interests? 

I'm actually an atheist but as I mentioned before but this is the same type of racism I was describing. When a brown woman protests Islamophobia/racism then she automatically gets labeled as one of those Muslims brainwashed by her own men or trying to defend her religion. The subtle racism becomes very apparent and the truth is most desi/mena radfems ARE ex-Muslims but still know the difference between white women actually caring for us vs just using us as a pawn for their xenophobic ideas towards brown men. Most brown radfems I know are not comfortable with white women championing their issues so vehemelently, making comments like Muslim men are pedophiles, terrorists etc. Due to things like that, almost 50 non-radical Muslims were killed including 4 women and 2 children. Sikh men who wear turbans and get mistaken for Muslim get pushed in subway tracks, Indian men who are actually usually Hindu but perceived to be Muslim get shot, etc. This is why Muslim and ex-Muslim women usually feel that it should only be their place to talk about it, and yes we have a voice to.

As for Christchurch, I guess it felt strange to not see much discussion on it because white radfems are all about caring for brown women when it comes to brown men being oppressive, but don't say much when white nationalist men oppress and kill us. Also very eery that a lot of radfems were making jokes about not being able to criticize Islam right after the shooting. The desire to make jokes after such a gruesome event without even acknowledging the brown women and children killed just demonstrates why many brown radfems question if Western radfems actually cared for us in the first place or only when it's time to paint Eastern men as savages.

As for Muslim men oppressing women, I feel that it has more to do with the area as opposed to religion. I've experienced misogyny and pedophilia from Hindu men, from Sikh men, from Christian men, just as much I've experienced it from Muslim men. Eastern men are trash regardless of their religion but I find it weird when people just try to paint it solely as a 'because of Islam' thing. If that were the case you'd see Indonesia and Malaysia which are majority Muslim having the same misogyny as Saudi Arabia."

&gt;scaremongering about Muslims.

Show me where I am wrong about muslims.

&gt;Muslims are allowed to have Jewish and Christian friends, they're even allowed to marry them. The Quran is a direct conversation between Muhammad and Allah. Those verses were specific to a certain situation in Muhammad's lifetime, not a commandment to all Muslims until the end of time.

As with all faiths, there are various factions that interpret the teachings differently.  The interpretation you are pointing to is an extreme minority within the muslim faith community - so please don't point to that as the standard example of the muslim faith.

That said, your comment ""they're even allowed to marry them"" is a 1/2 truth.  Muslim men are allowed to take Jewish / Christian wives - as they are of ANY conquered people.  The point is that doing so is one of the processes to convert those of other faiths.  A muslim woman CANNOT marry a Jewish man.  It is a one-way street of conversion.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfaith_marriage_in_Islam


&gt;According to all four schools of Sunni law and Shia law, interfaith marriages are condoned only between a Muslim male and a non-Muslim female from the People of the Book (that is, Christians and Jews) and not vice versa. In many Muslim majority countries, interfaith marriages (apart from marriages of Muslim men to Jewish-or-Christian women) are prohibited, and/or regarded as socially taboo.

In some diaspora societies, interfaith marriages between Muslims and non-Muslims take place at substantial rates, including marriages that contradict the sharia consensus. For example, in the United States, about one in ten Muslim women are married to non-Muslims, including about one in six Muslim women under 40 and about 20% of Muslim women who describe themselves as less devoutly religious.[1] 

Thank you for bringing that up, because it points exactly to what I'm talking about: NO ASSIMILATION.  In fact, it is only the 'less devoutly religious' that break the cultural norm.  The norm is constructed to prevent assimilation.

The sad fact is that muslims are much more likely to marry their cousins than they are to marry outside their faith.  

&gt;Anyway, this guy was Australian terrorist. He had no business being in NZ. He didn't live there.

The relationship between Australia and New Zealand is even closer than that of the United States and Canada.  I assume you haven't lived in either, so you probably won't understand... but it is a unique cultural oddity.  The only other set of countries I could possibly equate it to is UK / Ireland - and they share an island and fight all the time.  It is that sort of brotherly closeness... but without the overt hostility between the two.

&gt;The Muslims did, however; so they had more right being there than he did. 

""Right to be there"" is a legal status - and in that case you are correct.  However, I'm not looking at this through the lens of legality - it is the wrong lens to use if you are trying to make sense of it.  I am looking at it from the lens of culture, and in that lens the Australian guy has FAR more in common with New Zealand than the muslims do.  "

54,efyzga5,"I'll likely get downvoted for this comment, but here goes anyway. 

So what happens if a woman freely wants to wear the headscarf and is part of this century. Many brilliant Muslim women doctors, engineers, scientists, advanced scholars who wear the scarf out of their absolute free will and happen to be extremely productive and wonderful members of society. In fact, I know a few Muslim women who choose to wear the hijab against even the advice of their Muslim parents, because they are scared that this may subject them to abuse, which is increasingly evident, given this continuing political and media blitz against Muslims. 

So, how do you reconcile that? How do you reconcile that a Muslim women, want to wear the Hijab out of her 100% free will and is still living in the 21st century and she is an amazingly productive women, who happens to work in an advanced field? This is not uncommon by the way. Do you enforce that by going to these women and ripping their head scarfs by force, or do you ban them from being doctors, engineers, scientists until they take off their coverings? How do you force them exactly? Do you get a modern version of the Gestapo? Do you strip them of their citizenship or call them traitors and kick them out of their country? 
What is your definition of being a modern citizen? Is it based on clothes or based on people being law abiding, upstanding individuals, who love their country and do their best to be productive and useful members of society?

This position is the same as the opposite side, where ultra religious people may say, ban the mini skirt or low cut tops because it is too sexually provocative and women should not wear such things. If you say that such ""revealing"" clothes is part of modern society and is a modern achievement, I can tell you that 1000's of years back, that was what women used to be like, they used to wear revealing clothes as well. 

I must stress at this point that women or any human, should NEVER be forced to wear a certain type of clothing, whether it is enforcing the Hijab in places like Iran or Saudi or calls for banning it in places like France or Quebec. 

In this context, I think the whole thing means only one thing, it is not about clothes, or attitude, it's a form of hidden anti-islamic prejudice that some people have. Clothes and Hijab are not the root cause for these calls. If it's not about clothes for muslims, they will find something else. It does not end there, and with these people, it never will.

The whole thing is deeply disturbing and exposes the deep hypocrisy and hidden hatred that people have for certain religions and cultures, i.e. Islam. Much of it is till entrenched in the orientalist mindset, that somehow, Muslim women are enslaved by their menfolk and it is upto the enlightened west to free them from this slavery. How about people take away this lens and see the truth and treat everyone with respect and equity. Have you ever met and talked to Muslims about this and see how they feel about it, especially women who choose to wear the hijab? Ironic that many devout catholic politicians for example who have a disdain for Muslim women wearing the hijab, would revere catholic nuns, even though they wear their own form of it.

Many Muslims are amazing citizens of western countries, they are well integrated productive human beings. They love and respect their fellow citizens, are loyal, law abiding citizens, whilst still being practicing Muslim, and in fact, many take their inspiration to be model citizens from Islam itself, despite what some people may believe. Most of those Muslims who have committed offenses and acts of major crimes, do so against every major tenet of Islam, and many times scholars have proven this by using multiple Islamic sources (most mass media does not take interest in this, they only play to the narrative that islam only=death and terror). 

This constant spotlight and suspicion against Muslims is being being perpetuated and exploited by many haters and achieves nothing apart from hatred, and division and makes the lives for many Muslims very difficult and especially tormonts Muslim women, as they are often subject of hateful stares and increasingly verbal and physical abuse in many western countries. This toxic agenda, although talks about the oppression of Muslim women, makes the lives of Muslim women worse, instead of better, as it puts the spotlight on them from the rest of society. Much of that focus is hatred and suspicion. Don't believe me? Go and speak to Muslim women and find out what many of them have to go through when they walk the streets or go to public areas, sadly, and increasingly so, they are subject to unpleasant behaviours, including violence as mentioned. Again, this is not about the hijab or a certain garb, this is much more sinister. It is hidden hate and bigotry, the facts and experiences of many people prove this. 
Let us not forget that only recently there was the 2 year anniversary of the Quebec Mosque massacre, committed by a bigoted terrorist who was driven by this kind of hatred and suspicion.

57,ec9h0gq,"Not really. How many countries have backward cultures that believe women are not equal and non-Muslim women are trash? What do they all have in common? You haven't met Muslims from anywhere except the US if you think most Muslims are as ""moderate"" as the mostly non-practicing college Muslim in the US. All versions of Islam are quite explicitly against women, homosexuals, and non-believers.  It's not at all surprising that its followers keep committing atrocities regardless of what country they are in, often in groups, sometimes large groups or in one of the *multiple* terrorist organizations inspired by Islam. Their death cult holds them all together. "

59,e6ua8g9,"I’m very pro-Israel. 

-Do I think their gov’t has done some shady shit? Of course. But that doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to exist as a nation-state. The anti-Zionists use so many strawmans you can’t even have a conversation. For instance, the attack on the USS Liberty doesn’t mean Israel shouldn’t exist. If someone brings it up to support their argument, just stop listening. *“Their government killed 100 Americans so their population of 9 million people should now leave that land and give it to Palestine”.*.The double standard is ridiculous. Only 3 years ago Yemen fired missiles at a US destroyer. No one said a thing. Whenever Israel fires one bullet at anyone (usually terrorists), the scrutiny is stifling. 

-Find me one anti-Zionist that would give up their land to a Native American to serve some sort of perceived retribution/justice. All land is stolen. If you believe that land won through wars is “earned” (just like our land from the Brits) then Israel has earned their right to stay and then some. The bravery in which they’ve defended themselves in the last 60 years has rarely been matched throughout history. Don’t expect other people to do stuff you wouldn’t do. You wouldn’t see New York’s liberal anti-Zionist elitists giving their 10million dollar homes to native Iroquois. 

-The land Israel sits on was disputed to begin with. There was no unified nation on that land before Israel was created. The ONLY things that brought Palestine together is a collective hatred of Jews amongst Muslims and terrorist funding through Hezbollah, Hamas, and the surrounding anti-Israel countries. The anti-Israel propaganda is largely pushed by these groups and the radical Muslims countries that have seats in the UN. (Iran, Lebanon, Egypt, etc...). It’s a disgrace that nations with totalitarian governments get to vote on anti-Israeli resolutions in the general assembly. *We don’t let our people vote, but our ambassador is voting for decreased UN support of Israel this afternoon.* 

-Israel is the ONLY nation that can be trusted with possession of Jerusalem. People of ALL faiths are permitted to visit. Would Jews be allowed in if the Palestinians owned Jerusalem? Let’s not kid ourselves.... If the Palestinians succeeded in their efforts to occupy and reclaim land, we would see a massacre of Israeli civilians on the scale of the Rwandan genocide. 

Israel is the only middle-eastern country where gays can be gay, where women have the exact same rights under the law as men, and there is freedom of religion. The anti-Zionists are so obsessed with their “stolen land” theories that they refuse to see what Israel actually did with that land. RESULTS MATTER. How many gay men have been spared just by the nature of being born into Israeli territory vice Palestinian? How many Israeli-born Muslim women are free to marry whoever they want without fear of acid attacks or familial exile? You can’t control the vagina you slide out of. The people born in Israel know how truly lucky they are compared to their neighbors just a few miles away. This is why they faithfully serve their military and are willing to die for their country. 

-Lastly, western anti-zionists are the epitome of overprivileged. You have to come from an extreme place of ignorance and privilege to sit behind a computer or sit in a classroom and make an argument that a group of people who risk their lives every day to defend their freedoms should give it up to a bunch of people that cut off hands and beat their wives.

60,e5egre5,"Bruzzer! 

&gt;Yes it is as long as her father acknowledge him and they are following the procedure

So Islam is ok with child bride, just like i mentioned earlier. Sugar coating it doesn't negate the fact a child is still a child even if she already had her puberty. Thanks for acknowledgingmy point.



&gt;I did see school shooting by a christian fanatic. But for some reason he is not a terrorist but a lone wolf 

Yeah many happened unfortunately, but they weren't religiously motivated. Muslims on the other hand would call for the killings of anyone for blasphemy, and that's a fact. So much for a religion of peace.



&gt;This is regarding divorces, in marriage the responsibility to find income and everything falls to the man

Not anymore, both men and women work to support their families, but why only the men has the final say? And the quran states it as such. It's the final word of god. And you can't argue that this only applies to that time because quran is supposed to be for all times. Men can simply utter the word divorce and they are divorce, whereas women has to go through a whole difficult process just to get a divorce. Where is the equality in that?



&gt;whats the problem with this?

Where's the equality when women has to obey their husbands under any circumstances? Muslim  women are obligated to fulfill their husbands' requests all the time or run the risk of being disobedient.

&gt;If you want to relate in that era, woman normally went out with another female friend and almost never went out alone due to the condition of the era.

You're just explaining that during those times women always go out in pairs. Ok, so.....?  You failed to explain that in islam the testimonies of a man is equal to that. of 2 women. Why? I can point you to hadiths that the prophet views women as lacking and stupid when compared to men. 

&gt;So, it is obvious that a woman alone witnessing something happen is something almost impossible.

Your logic here is laughable, and still doesn't explain the inequality.

&gt;family in islam placed husband as the leader.

Exactly my point about inequality in islam. Thanks! Why is men better placed than women?


&gt;Beat then in form of teaching, not to hurt them

Physical punishment is taught to be a deterrent, but it doesn't necessarily have the effect intended. Physically beating another human being can leave an everlasting scar physically and emotionally. If you beat your wife lightly with a toothbrush like stick as prescribed by some muslim scholars, what is the point then? u think your wife is going to be deterred? pls explain?



&gt;This only happen if they did something bad, for example going out with other man or keep on doing haram stuff

I think at this point you should divorce your wife as she's probably not in love with you anymore. Beating her won't change a thing if she no longer is in love with you. 

&gt;One question from me, do you even read the quran's translation and tafseer for each of the verse you mentioned above?

Yes I did and that's why i left islam. i was born a muslim, i certainly didn't get to choose what to believe in, it was essentially forced onto me by my parents. 

After reading and researching and questioning i came to the conclusion that islam's viewpoint is of that a 7th century dessert man and has no place in today's society. 

Quran is supposed to be a book for all mankind for all times, but it fails the test of time.

Hope this answers your questions!"
61,e3r1s8t,"I think you’re evidence doesn’t quite say what you want it to. Broadly speaking it states that Muslims are more likely to identify as British than non-Muslims. It doesn’t state the relative importance they give to Britishness versus religious identity. 

&gt; Eighty-five percent said they felt they belonged to Britain. More than half (55%) said their national identity was important, compared with 44% of the general population.

&gt; Religious identity is extremely or very important to 94%, and more than half pray at least five times a day or engage in worship of some kind.

There are also some other worrying indicators of their failure to integrate:

&gt; More than 7% of Muslims are unemployed, compared with 4% of the UK population as a whole.

Muslims are less likely to be in the workforce. Remember, this is also unemployed; that doesn’t include those that simply opt to not be in the workforce. We know that Muslim women are twice as likely to simply not be looking for jobs at all:

https://fullfact.org/economy/are-muslim-women-more-likely-be-unemployed/

And the kicker:

&gt; Muslims tend to have more conservative social attitudes than the general population, the report said. Half of Muslim men and one-third of women believe wives should obey their husbands, and 38% of men said it is acceptable for a British Muslim to have more than one wife. A majority said homosexuality should not be legal.

There’s also the fact that Muslims are overwhelmingly responsible for terrorist related death in the UK and Europe more widely over the last five years. Since the turn of the century they’ve also conducted the vast majority of terrorist attacks leading to death in Europe, even taking into account Anders Breivik. "
62,e433rxd,"Okay. Why do I catch a lot of anti-muslim racism. Same Reason that Sunil Triparthi was fingered as a Muslim terrorist. Because he was not White. Never mind the fact he was Hindu. Same reason why Sikhs are targetted by racists. 

Because all the people who say ""It's not racism to be a dick to Muslim women"" are pretty much racists who shout abuse at brown people and are repeatedly found to be dumbasses because they target non-Muslims. 

Conservative Christianity doesn't tolerate gay or non-Muslim people. As a non-White person marrying a White person? You really  have no idea how many places STILL don't marry non-Christians.

Are you going to ban Hassidic Jewish outfits too? Because I see no difference between them and the Burkha. What about the turban for Sikh men? 

I support women wearing what they want. If Jews can call out Corbyn's support of Israel as anti-semitic then Asians can call you out for being racist. 

Your argument smacks of the nonsense they said to my mum when she wore a Sari. 

We didn't get equality by listening to morons who told us what to wear. We wear what we want, you wear what you want. If you start policing women's outfits?

Well then what's to stop Muslims from making an equal point suggesting women shouldn't wear Miniskirts. Either it's an equal law where ANYONE can ban an outfit offensive to them or we have to accept that as Asians? 

We are second class citizens. Which means we have to start sitting in the white only areas of buses and trains again and fighting for our right to wear what we wish to without some bumpkin racist comparing women in Niqabs (I must note your usual argument of rescuing them from oppression has stopped) to letterboxes, bank robbers and murderous terrorists. 

The Klan tortured and raped children. All of them were complicit. They all agreed it was needed to keep Black people ""down"". 

I have never been oppressed by some lady in a niqab. I have lead my life as I chose. In fact the only dickheads who do any bullshit that annoys me have been people pretending to be civilised. By definition? None were good people.

4. FGM is a widespread practice occurring right now, in every country that has Muslims. Again, Google it.
5. Since when did they declare peace in the middle east? Did I sleep through that? Nah, pretty sure Muslims still hate Jews. 
6. Muslims regard Christians as infidels, and we all know how they feel about infidels. 
7. So how come I NEVER hear ""moderate"" Muslims condemning terrorist acts? Never. Not once.

But, yay for you for not trash talking Jesus. Then again, unlike YOUR prophet, Jesus never did anything he could be trash talked for. "
64,e4b6492,"Hey there. May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon you.

You've posted in the right place :) It sucks that you had to live with an Islamophobic person but it's great that you've tried to explain the true image of Islam to him! I totally understand that significant events (e.g. terrorist attacks) and the media can heavily influence our perception of things so it's not at all surprising that he has these views.

It's also great that you've come here to polish up your knowledge of Islam. I'll try to answer your questions as best as I can but I'm sure there will be others who are better at explaining things than I am :P

&gt;what it means to be a Muslim

*Islam* means submission to Allah. A *Muslim* is someone who submits to Allah.

&gt;What is Sharia law? Is it a fixed constitution? Did it change over the centuries? What influences it?

*Shari'ah* refers to the Islamic law and legislation. It is derived from the Qur'an, the word of Allah, and the Hadith, the words and actions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). There are four major schools of jurisprudence, each of which have slightly different methodologies for deriving *shari'ah* rulings.

&gt;What are muslim values? Are there universal values which decide whether you are a good or a bad muslim?

In Islam, there are many core beliefs but they are often called the 'five pillars of Islam' and the 'articles of faith'. The five pillars of Islam are: testimony of faith, prayer, charity, fasting and pilgrimage. The articles of faith are believing in: Allah, His angels, His divine books, His messengers, the Day of Judgement, pre-ordainment and that everything, good or bad, comes from Allah, and life after death. A person must believe in this key tenets of faith in order to become a Muslim.

&gt;How does islamic extremism happen? Why do muslims seem to be quite approachable for extremist groups?

It's worth noting that the term 'Islamic extremism' is slightly offensive because it implies that the terrorism derives from Islam and Muslims as a whole. I prefer using the term 'Islamist extremism', which refers to terrorism that derives from a fundamentalist and political view of Islam.

Extremism occurs in every religion, including Islam. There are some groups that have a political agenda and who also have very strict interpretations of the Qur'an, which are often taken completely out of context and used unlawfully. Terrorism and killing innocent civilians is completely against Islamic teachings. I think the political instability in the Middle East has certainly fueled radicalisation and Islamic extremism but I'm not a historian or someone with great knowledge of Middle Eastern politics, so don't quote me on that.

&gt;Why are women often in a worse position in muslim societies?

Islam gives women a very high status. There is no inequality or discrimination in Islam.

* All humans will be equally judged before Allah.
* *Both men and women* are told to be modest, just in different ways.
* Both men and women have rights and responsibilities that perfectly complement each other, but they are not the same.
* Both men and women are encouraged to seek knowledge; the Prophet's wife, A'isha (may Allah be pleased with her) was one of the most influential scholars and narrators of hadeeth in Islam.
* Women were given inheritance, something introduced by Islam.
* Women are not obliged to work, while their husbands are obliged to spend on them. Anything the wife earns is for herself. The Prophet's first wife, Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her), was a very successful businesswoman.
* Women have the right to marry who they want and cannot be forced to marry someone. When this occurs, though, it's due to cultural, not religious, reasons.

&gt;What's up with covering your head/body/face and circumcision?

Muslims must remain modest. The Qur'an says,

&gt;Say to the believers, that they cast down their eyes and guard their private parts; that is purer for them. God is aware of the things they work. (30) And say to the believing women, that they cast down their eyes' and guard their private parts, and reveal not their adornment save such as is outward; and let them cast their veils over their bosoms... (31) (Surah 24)

The last part of the second verse uses the word *khimar*. This refers to a cloth that covers the head. So, Muslim women are commanded to cover their head and chest, which is why many Muslim women wear the *hijab*.

The Qur'an also says,

&gt;O Prophet, say to thy wives and daughters and the believing women, that they draw their veils close to them; so it is likelier they will be known, and not hurt. God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate. (59) (Surah 33)

The word used in this verse is *jalabib*. This refers to a loose outer garment. This is why many Muslim women were loose dresses, to cover the rest of their body.

There are some women who cover the face. Many contemporary scholars say that it does not need to be covered.

Male circumcision is obligatory according to two schools of thought. The other two say that it is highly recommended. Female circumcision is obligatory according to two schools of thought. The other two say that it is permissible / honourable, but not obligatory.

65,e1qdvrd,"Paradox of Intolerance is a nice thought experiment, but philosophy questions rarely reflect how things go in an actual society. Free speech, which includes insensitive speech, is basic building block of basic society. For ideas to be exchanged freely we need to be able to share our ideas without fear of social ruin. The free sharing of ideas is how we got this far as a people. The thought police would rather people only share their opinion if it exactly reflects their own, which is being seen in sjw community.

&gt;Only about 19% of the US population voted for Trump

That statistic is a bit disingenuous. He got 46% of the popular vote. Are you counting percent of total us population? If we're doing that, then you have to also say that half the country didn't vote. We have enough misleading statistics floating around, please don't add to them. [Article with actual numbers for those curious](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/12/21/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-popular-vote-final-count/index.html)

&gt;What groups do you think are commonly thought to be oppressed that aren't in your opinion?

I think the best examples come from the Tumblr sphere where people are constantly coming up with newer more fragmented terms to label themselves in order to feel special. However, I do feel that many people have forgotten there is very little true oppression America and, to some extent, most first world countries. Go look up how Muslim women are treated in the middle east. Much less in terrorist controlled territories. That is true oppression. Back to the first world, it may be anecdotal, but I many people know at least one person who blames all failures and setbacks on race. However, the biggest way to determine what opportunities a person will have in life is the socioeconomic status of their parents. Not skin color. 

This conversation is getting far outside the scope of big brother, I would like to end by putting forward one more thought. Why do people focus so heavily on same outcomes rather than same opportunities?  Equality doesn't mean that, for example, 50% of all teachers be male and 50% be female. It should mean that anyone can decide to become a teacher regardless of sex or race. I don't have it in front of me, but I recall a study that showed certain jobs have an even bigger difference in number of males vs females when everyone is truly given the same opportunities. That isn't a bad thing."
66,e2csfi3,"&gt;Are you sure? A white Christian culture moving into a white Christian culture? In the superpower nation which will despite the great depression experience phenomenal post war growth. You think that is as comparable?

The Irish were viewed as more alien in Olde New England than poor Haitian boat people are today in the US. Unassimilable, as good as pagan — the Catholic / Protestant split was extremely sharp then; they used to burn Papists in effigy in Boston — speaking an incomprehensible dialect at best, breeding like rabbits, innately criminals and terrorists (the Fenian raids, the Draft Riots), et cetera. And this was an era when people thought that there were massive “racial” differences between the Irish and sound English stock.

And now, eh. Pat Buchanan whines ironically about one million Zulus.

And that was without an official program of assimilation. (I suppose one could argue that France’s culture of officialdom might make assimilation harder. Then again, using the Irish-US example as a comparison, France looks slightly ahead.)

&gt;Here's an issue I'd point out. The Catholics and Protestants in the US intermarry more than the Muslims and non Muslims in France. Is that an issue? Does success require that level of assimilation?


Statistics on intermarriage and minority groups generally are difficult to find in France, partly because of the ban on the collection of information on religious affiliation and ethnic background in the French census after the Second World War. 

The authors of Sixty Million French claim, on page 301, that half of immigrant men marry non-immigrant women, and that one-quarter of immigrant women marry non-immigrant men, for a total intermarriage rate of roughly 40%. This figure is high, and is only a shade below the 60% intermarriage rate for North American Jews that encourages many to doubt the future of North American Jewry. I can’t find specific statistics for French Muslims, but given their prominence in the French immigrant population it isn’t too much of a stretch to assume comparable intermarriage rates.

In the meantime, the status of French Muslim women is particularly interesting. Consider, in the light of substantially greater French Muslim male exogamy, the situation facing French Muslim women, who can respond in only three ways to the deficit of men in their community.


French Muslim women remain celibate, and childless.

French Muslim women are not involved in stable or permanent relationships with Maghrebin men.

French Muslim women in France are marrying non-Muslim men.



None of these options--particularly the last--are compatible with a high rate of endogamy, or with a very successful reproduction of traditional Maghrebin culture in France over the long term. 





I searched for data on religious practice among French Muslims for a while, until I found this article from Islam Online concerning a French report on religious belief among Muslims in France.

Admitting that compared to other believers Muslims are more keen on abiding by their religious teachings, the French experts claimed that only 10 to 20 percent of France's six million Muslims do so. 

There are Muslims who drink and others who do not go to mosques, Ternisien said, arguing many members of the Islamic community in France are already ""secularized."" 

&gt;According to a study published in 2001 by the French public opinion institute, 70 percent of France's Muslims fast during the holy fasting month of Ramadan but only 30 percent of them perform their prayers. 

The study also argued that 70 percent of French Muslims do not go to mosques.


I'm inclined to accept this report as valid, if only because Islam Online isn't a website that's particularly eager to accept secularism or assimilation among Western Muslims.

 There is a long tradition of immigrants to France rapidly secularizing--Catholics from Spain and Italy, for instance, are reported to have abandoned the religious practices of their homelands relatively quickly.

Michel Gurfinkiel has correctly observed that at 5% each, there are as many Muslims as there are observant Catholics. As he himself accepts, though, only a small minority of French residents of Muslim background are observant Muslims. He does mention how on special holidays attendance increases sharply, as a way of indicating the potential for greater faith. I find it surprising, though, that Gurfinkiel is unaware of the fact that although church attendance increases sharply around Easter, you don't get enduring spikes in Christian piety."
67,e2gagos,"Thank you for your reply. As much as I dont want to point towards any direction about this argument, if we were to look at some of the posts on this conversation it seems that everybody feels the need to 'liberate' muslim women because all muslim women are (1) immigrants and hence (2)not integrated (3) potential terrorists and hence need to show their body (4) bullied by their male counterparts, be it husband or otherwise. Now if we are honest, yes there are a lot of muslim women who are forced to wear certain clothings, and are oppressed in muslim nations, there is no denying that. However having a law made which specifically targets one group more than any other creates a divide among itself. It surely treats muslim women differently, the same difference that these people claim muslim women feel in their own houses or nations. Notice that I havent even mentioned muslims women who are born and brought up in the west, surely  they arent 'proper' citizens?!?! It is important to realize that most anti islamic attitudes tend to hurt women rather than muslim men, overwhelmingly. The first step the nazis took is to make the 'jews' appear different to everyone else, from their customs to their dress sense.  Which is why I personally feel that its important we hear from the people it affects. "
68,dxwnh0h,"I mean, it wasn't that long ago that Christian terrorists were bombing abortion clinics and shooting doctors (heck, even this year we had a Christian extremist drive a truck into a Planned Parenthood--sound familiar?--but luckily no one died), and just in Austin they had a three-week serial murderer bombing minorities who *just happened* to be super conservative Christian, but the police refuse to call it terrorism. We hear about all the truck attacks and bombings in other countries, but when perpetrated in our own country, it's only covered nationwide when the killers are brown/Muslim.

But lots of queer folx, especially trans people, are still murdered and abused in the US by Christians. [Here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/06/02/gay-man-says-church-members-beat-choked-him-for-hours-to-expel-homosexual-demons/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.ab98868f57ba) is the story of a man who was lucky to survive attack by his church fellows, [these brothers](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/hatecrimes/stories/brothers072199.htm) 
 involved with white Christian extremism murdered a gay couple. Brazil, which is very very Christian, has a huge problem of LGBT people being murdered.

Dozens of trans women (almost always of color) just happen to show up dead every year in the US, often without ever having their murders solved. Considering that the people trying to take away trans rights, especially the goddamn bathroom crusaders, are all prominently Christian, it's pretty likely that the murderers of those trans women are mostly Christian.

And the KKK was one of the biggest terrorist organizations around, and very militantly Christian, though they targeted racially as well as queer people and are much more famous for their racially-motivated but Christian-based murders. Heck, it was just back in 2014 that a 73-year-old KKK member Frazier Glenn Miller murdered three people in a Jewish community, because I guess he missed the murdering.

And of course, it's not just white Americans doing the murdering, just that white Americans ignore Christian terrorism. American evangelicals have been a huge driving force behind all the anti-gay laws in Africa. [Here](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/27/homophobia-christian-africa_n_4675618.html) is an article from a few years ago it, from a Christian. It's still illegal to be homosexual in 34 African countries, Christian and Muslim alike. Uganda just *added more* anti-gay laws with lifetime imprisonment, and they're trying to make it punishable by death, and they're 85% Christian.

The murders are a little less common currently, yeah. But for oppression of women, heh, boyyyyyyyyyyy could we get into a lot of examples, including the multiple Republican officials who have called pregnancies from rape a ""gift from God"", or the fact that many Christian groups still won't allow women to hold positions of power, and many extremist groups force the women to dress ultraconservatively and cover their hair in fashions only slightly less extreme than what Muslim women are stereotypically thought to wear. Especially as someone who works around a lot of  Mennonite people (not to mention the Amish, heh), and see Christian women with their mandatory little bonnets and fully-covered bodies in loose dresses all year round...."
69,dy08nde,"Yes, but the middle east is the worst... You must think im exaggerating when i say: Modern Day Slavery, i am not joking. And it isnt only the women, Men as well! Go there on a promise of good pay and end up becoming enslaved with little pay, horrible construction conditions, many lose their lives, and unable to make enough to go back home




If what you want is to defend your islamic countries (Gulf countries) thats on you, but you are defending human-rights-terrorist who barely value their own citizen's lives, even less the lives of their neighboring Nations, why do you think theyre always at eachothers throats (even though they're Muslim) and non muslims to them are an open all you can eat buffet, the women?! Theyre openly misogynistic to their OWN WOMEN, non muslim women are cattle."
70,dys29y3,"Right thats a load of waffle too. What marches have taken place in london were there are Isis flags? Your lime Trump with his no go areas claim. The 'sneaky mayor' you mention ( who I'm no fan of) has infact condemned Islamic terrorism.  www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-condemns-11176153.amp. And he is a politician so not answering Q' is like half the job. You jump to the conclusion that the money comes from Saudi Arabia because it suits your stereotypes no evidence. Then you go on about how Muslim women are inslaved and forced to wear the niqab but fail to recognise that the majority do it willingly. Yeah sure there have been Islamic terrorist attacks committed by a tiny fraction of the millions of Muslims in Britain but they are not butchering their way across Europe as you suggest. The point about the north is not moot. If the Islamic population in Ireland was to ever  get to be a majority (never) they can do whatever they want with the values the land.   They would be the majority, that is kinda how it all works. I jump to defend Muslims when they are being discriminated against, as I would do with any race or greed. I completely support the right to free speech and that of Charlie hebdo.  I haven't suggested otherwise. Like you I'm sure I strongly disagree with this campaign of non platforming controversial speakers. However throughout this debate you have made wild claims that reek of paranoia and conspiracy. You have used racist language and have fundementley failed to grasp that equality extends to all citizens not only those with ancestral links. I'm not saying I'm not bias, but I feel your being very prejudiced in your thinking and not going by facts. Try understand the counter arguments. "
71,dwf3a2l,"\&gt;Your kid-slaughtering, imperialistic culture sucks balls

I don't disagree that the American government is basically a global terrorist organization.

However, Muslim women are oppressed. Get over your Stockholm syndrome."
72,dwpxq0m,"Yes there are and that is a problem what to do about it well... I dunno again though you have the same problems with Indians and being treated the same and being married off to people from the home country. I doubt you'll find any feminists in favor of forced marriage or forced veiling. Where is the line between voluntary and forced? When it comes from family pressure that's really hard, I'm certainly in favor of stricter and better funded CPS.

As for Muslim women do you think they are all oppressed? Many aren't and many second generation Muslim students at my university opted to keep the veil. Affirmative action, current divorce laws, battered women's shelters all these resources are in place to help a Muslim woman who wants to leave, but not all Muslim women are abused and many Mosques in the US are quite liberal also it depends on the denomination Ismailis which are old and not some new age sect are quite progressive, there are educated empowered Muslim women in the US not all of them need saving I think feminists are open to criticizing harmful practices just not the religion as a whole. Again most feminists tend to do the same for Christianity and there are Christian and Muslim feminists as well.

 Regarding the veil I think feminists are divided I know I am. People should where what they want but... I'm not sure the symbolism is at all helpful. At the same time I know pious Muslim girls who would  be horrified at having to take off their veil to the same degree as if a Western girl had to take off her top, so where the line is I don't know. Parents have a lot of discretion over their children is a dad forcing his daughter to cover her hair so different from a dad forcing his daughter to wear frumpy ankle laced dresses? My point being that these issues are not unique to Muslims in America it's also worth noting that most Muslims in America who do cover wear the hijab just covering the hair but not the face, a full burqa like in Afghanistan is truly rare, and in Muslim countries not everyone or even most cover the hair depending on the country of course. If it seems like I don't have a clear opinion on this it's because I don't

What I do have an opinion on is a lot of the conservative criticism of Islam is unhelpful, most defense of Islam I see are not defending the above practices but defending the right of  Muslims to come and live in America, defending that all Muslims are not terrorists, and defending their rights to live peacefully in our society and pointing out that many Muslims are quite liberal and Islam=/=Saudi Arabia. "
73,dwsnt5i,"Well... I'm a Muslim living in a Muslim country. I guess you could say I was born in it, molded by it. 

This is getting off topic, but it's what I felt when I first read your original comment. 

It gets tiring when I'm watching or reading up on world news and everytime the topic of ISIS or Islam comes up, people always generalize all Muslim as terrorist. **Not all** Muslim countries have strict Syariah laws. **Not all** Muslim men oppress their women. In my country, women (*only* Muslim women) are encouraged to wear hijab, but they are not forced to. They can drive, they can vote, they can become a CEO of a multi-million dollar company if they want. Basically, they have as much freedom of choice as any man in the country. The 'barbaric culture' you speak of is mainly in the Middle East. But that's mainly because of the strict Syariah laws. I don't even agree with most of their court decisions that I heard about. Getting jailed because you don't wear a hijab? The girl's not even a muslim! That is the dumbest shit ever. The victim of a rape getting several years of jail time? That shit fucking boils my blood and is the reason why I'm not in support of implementing Syariah laws in my country. But people still look at all muslims as barbarians.

The muslims in my country want nothing more than to live peacefully with other countries. As a Muslim, I can honestly say that we want nothing more than to separate ourselves from ISIS. Their acts of terrorism are appalling and disgusting. It is far from what the message of Quran is supposed to be. They literally twisted the interpretation of the Quran to fit their narrative. We as a country had condemned ISIS multiple times in the past. However, even though a lot of Muslims from a lot of countries has condemned ISIS, there's not a lot of action being taken to combat. This really boggles my mind but I'm not exactly well versed about it to commentate much. 

I dreamt of studying abroad at the US or the UK, but because of the whole terrorism thing, I gave up on that dream. I'm too afraid to go out my country now. There's a lot of first-hand accounts of my fellow countrymen going to the US and was heavily discriminated, especially with Trump in charge. "
74,dwye4uw,"Because there's a genuine misconception in America that all Muslim women are little more than unwitting slaves to their husbands, no doubt just waiting to be saved and run to the arms of American servicemen (because like many things, these kinds of notions are more about self-fulfilling fantasies than anything else).

And there's the misconception that Muslim fathers are abusive both towards their spouse(s) and their children.

Fucking shocker: it turns out most people are not that different from you or I. Yes, even the terrorists. After all, nobody is born a terrorist, it is something you become by conscious choice."
75,dxdbxgk,"I don’t know how ridiculing someones religious outfit is calling out evil. Attack the terrorists and men at the top who force these ladies to wear that shit. Those women inside those burkas are victims. They can’t escape that shit. They need help not ridicule.

Personally I think those outfits are slave outfits and fucking ridiculous but these women are trapped. Let’s make fun of the Muslim terrorist leaders like George Soros, London cuck mayor, Isis leaders, the royals, McCain and any other leaders of any religion conducting hate, division or terrorism. Those are fair game! Show the Muslim fucker that used the truck to kill people, that fucker and his family deserve eternal ridicule. Show him fucking a goat. I’ll upvote it. 

These Muslim women are victims themselves. Islam is a problem but we must defeat it by eradicating and ridiculing their terrorist leaders. Again look at that imam who is speaking out against these scumbag Muslim terrorists. Even Saudi Arabia is doing the same via the new prince.

We cant blanket attack the ones that need our help from within. It makes us all look like democrats. I love shit posts but don’t blanket ridicule all instead target those at the top more so. You wouldn’t find Jesus Christ shit posts on here ridiculing him or shit posts about concentration camp victims instead of ridiculing Hitler for his atrocities. These Muslim women are trapped and modern day slaves. Low hanging fruit ridicule, go after the Islamic leader scumbags behind the terror. Those shit posts are the ones that all religions will stand behind. The known terrorists and peeps pulling the strings. "
76,dusz49u,"Article text in case anyone cannot read it on mobile (part 1 of 2---see my reply to this comment for part 2). ~~I'll add the article's linked content in a spez shortly.~~ *Links added*

One of the greatest but overlooked (or ignored) fact concerning Islamic aggression and violence around the world is that non-Muslim women tend to be its greatest victims.  According to a January [**report dealing with the Muslim persecution of Christians**](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5261287/Persecution-Christians-rise.html#ixzz54Nt1ec2d), “The most significant findings were that Christian women are among the most violated in the world, in maybe a way that we haven’t seen before.”  Six women were raped every day simply for being Christian, the report found.

Much of this traces back to Islamic law.  Inherently harsh—its ultimate source is a seventh century Arab man, Muhammad—Sharia is still harsher for women.  Men have “authority” over women and [**may beat them for disobedience**](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=4&amp;verse=34).  The prophet said women are significantly [**less intelligent than men**](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/006-sbt.php#001.006.301) — two women are needed [**to equal one man’s testimony**](https://quran.com/2/282) — and the majority of hell’s denizens [**consist of women**](https://islamqa.info/en/21457), whom Muhammad further [**likened to donkeys and dogs**](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/009-sbt.php#001.009.493) in their ability to distract a man from his prayer and thereby annul it.

Such misogyny is confirmed by the [**headline of a new report**](http://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/02/05/bombshell-review-sharia-systemic-discrimination-women-unknown-number/): “UK Govt Review into Sharia Admits Systemic Discrimination Against Women …Forced Marriage Victim Made to Appear with Abusers.”

If this is Islam’s approach to Muslim women, non-Muslim women are doubly damned: not only are they, as infidels, “the enemy” by default, but as females, they are deemed even more inferior than their already despised male counterparts.  Add to this the facts that women are physically weaker—and physically more attractive—than men, and it becomes clear why they are widely seen as being, at best, “meant for one thing, the pleasure of the Muslim man,” as one Muslim told a group of young Christian girls before terrorizing and murdering one.  (Koran verses that encourage the [**sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women**](https://quran.com/4/24-34) and ingrained notions of [**“sex-on-demand,”**](https://sunnah.com/urn/1261700) obviously only propel such thinking.)

The subhuman treatment of non-Muslim women by jihadi organizations such as the Islamic State or Nigeria’s Boko Haram—where “infidel” women are bought, sold, gang-raped, mutilated, [**dismembered**](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/stories-of-isis-victims-are-emerging-and-theyre-unbelievably-brutal-64701/) and [**burned alive**](http://www.lifenews.com/2016/06/06/isis-burns-19-girls-alive-after-they-refuse-to-have-sex-with-their-terrorist-captors/)—is relatively well known (thanks to ISIS itself, for disseminating images and videos).    Lesser known is that “infidel” women are treated in similar ways all across the Muslim world, as [**explained by a 2016 report**](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/how-christian-women-suffer-worse-persecution-than-men-46793/):

&gt; Unfortunately, more and more women are the target of [Muslim] terrorist groups. There are numerous international incidents of women being kidnapped, raped, and forced to convert from Christianity to Islam by radical extremist groups…. Many are also sold on the open market. This brutality is not only occurring in the Middle East but in Africa and in many other places. In many of these countries, women are subject to persecution because they are considered second-class citizens because of their gender. As minorities in both gender and faith, Christian women face double the persecution. Although we don’t have an exact number, we know that millions of women are being persecuted…. In these Muslim-dominated countries, Christian women are systematically deprived of their freedom to live and are denied basic human necessities.

Approximately [**700 Christian and 300 Hindu girls are abducted, enslaved, and aped in Pakistan every year**](http://www.fides.org/en/news/35548-ASIA_PAKISTAN_Every_year_thousands_of_Hindu_and_Christian_girls_kidnapped_and_forced_into_Islamic_marriage_new_Report#.VAdIqvldVqV). These are very large numbers considering that Christians and Hindus each make up only one percent of the nation’s Muslim-majority population.  After a 9-year-old Christian girl was raped by a Muslim man who boasted of having “done the same service to other young Christian girls,” [**local residents explained**](http://www.fides.org/aree/news/newsdet.php?idnews=28031&amp;lan=eng): “Such incidents occur frequently. Christian girls are considered goods to be damaged at leisure. Abusing them is a right. According to the [Muslim] community’s mentality it is not even a crime. Muslims regard them as spoils of war.”  This is why when a young Muslim girl was recently raped and murdered, Pakistan rose up in outrage, whereas the ongoing rape and murder of Christian girls (and boys) is [**met with deafening silence**](http://raymondibrahim.com/2018/02/12/hate-behind-muslim-tears-outrage/).)

A similar situation prevails in Egypt. Congressman Chris Smith earlier testified about the “[**escalating abduction, coerced conversion and forced marriage of Coptic Christian women and girls. Those women are being terrorized and, consequently, marginalized**](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/26/escalating-violence-against-coptic-women-and-girls/).” Between 2008 and 2013 alone, nearly 600 cases of abduction, rape, and forced conversion of Christian women were documented in Egypt—again, very large numbers considering Christians are roughly only 10 percent of Egypt’s population.  A former kidnapper recently shed light on how methodical and virtually institutionalized this phenomenon is in Egypt.[1]"
77,dw09exg,"I feel like Muslim women, the wives, sisters and daughters of these men, are invisible in all this. 

Of course it's super important to focus on the victims of grooming, but as these horror stories unravel, I also inadvertently think of the wives and other women around these men who might be trapped in controlling and abusive situations. I absolutely do not believe that misogyny can be contained to one group of women, no, it permeates everything and men just express it slightly differently.

&gt;They made it clear that because I was a non-Muslim, and not a virgin, and because I didn’t dress “modestly”, that they believed I deserved to be “punished”. They said I had to “obey” or be beaten.

Like, when reading this, I feel horrified by these men's attitudes. Absolute, deep contempt, women are subhuman property to them. 
&gt;As someone who has experienced life inside a grooming gang, I can tell you with certainty that none of this [she's referring to racists, anti-fascists etc fighting] is likely to make any difference to the behaviours of groomers. 

Yeah, and none of these guys are fighting for women. The racists are fighting for themselves, to hate Muslims and immigrants, and the anti-fascist types do it because they hate the racists. I'm cynical about this and I think it figures that it doesn't help.
&gt;Like terrorists, they firmly believe that the crimes they carry out are justified by their religious beliefs.

Men will always justify their crimes one way or another.
&gt;If anything, rising anti-Muslim hate will probably make groomers stronger in their convictions, and drive ordinary young Muslim men towards fundamentalism, grooming gangs and terrorism. 

Perhaps. I can't say too much about this subject. But.... anti-Muslim hate also harms Muslim women. This piece treats it as though there're only Muslim men and abused (white/British) girls, I feel that it glosses over Muslim women and that doesn't sit right with me. Like, also, yeah you could make a point about radicalization and all that, but there's something so deeply, fundamentally *wrong* with these men, such a deep, profound misogyny, such a tremendous lack of respect for *any* women, and while we should prevent more radicalization, I'm also like... *For Goddess'  sake, someone do something for the women who're still left under these men's thumbs*. Maybe that will antagonize them more, I don't know, but the situation can't remain like this, the men who say and do these things are like 99,99% likely to be an abuser at home, too. And Muslim women will be hated by the right wing anyway, which is why I think it's so important that we look for avenues to open up this conversation among the Left and to start addressing the implications of all this. 

&gt;The camaraderie, protection, money, and kudos that these groups offer, makes them a strong pull for anyone. 

Yes, and the rape. Men bonding over their shared misogyny.
&gt;In November 2017, the Swedish government held a meeting where they stated that: “Sexual violence is being used as a tactic of terrorism”, and as such, it was recognised as a threat to Sweden’s national security.

This is kind of sad, isn't a massive rape problem on itself reason enough to call it a threat to national security? And it's being ''used as a tactic''-- perhaps, but it also counts as sexual terrorism *purely on itself* imo.

&gt;The link between terrorism and rape undertaken by Islamist gangs was not being ignored. They called for counter-extremism education. This sounds like a balanced and intelligent governmental response to me.

Yes, but... there're *huge* misogyny problems to unravel here as well. For Goddess' sake, let them stop hating women. If they manage to pull them away from extremism that's nice and all, but this HAS to change as well. Or at least help women from their communities, there's probably a MASSIVE rape crisis there as well, just hidden and tucked away, protected by ''marriage''.
&gt;“Muslim girls are good and pure because they dress modestly, covering down to their ankles and wrists, and covering their crotch area. They stay virgins until marriage. They are our girls.

Yes, possessiveness, control, Madonna-whore complex, pedestal, abuse. Notice how this quote erases girl's and women's humanity/personhood, instead of people, they're representatives of values, vehicles of the (male) family honor. 
&gt;""White girls and non-Muslim girls are bad because you dress like slags. You show the curves of your bodies (showing the gap between your thighs means you’re asking for it) and therefore you’re immoral. White girls sleep with hundreds of men. You are the other girls. You are worthless and you deserve to be gang-raped.”


Raging, frightening misogyny.
&gt;This hateful religious hypocrisy strikes people to their very core.

I'm not sure it's hypocrisy. This woman puts a lot of emphasis on religion, but I think that a large part of this is simple, visceral misogyny, and in a context of misogyny, this all makes sense. The shallow yet misogynistic lip-service to Muslim women's virtue and the out-and-overt honest misogyny aimed at non-Muslim women are 2 sides of the same deeply misogynistic coin.


&gt;My main perpetrator quoted scriptures from the Quran to me as he beat me. However, almost identical scriptures (about the stoning to death of virgins who don’t scream when they are raped) can also be found in the Bible.

So, she goes on for a while about the several religions. She doesn't want to incite any violence, it seems. So... we get to this:

&gt;As a Rotherham grooming gang survivor, I am told that both child protection services and the prosecution of offenders is improving in most areas. But frustratingly, prevention hasn’t really begun.


And please *please* prevent harm to women and girls who're around these men in the private sphere and under their control. I suspect that Rotherham (and other places where these things happened) also have a lot of silent victims, the aforementioned Muslim women who might have nowhere to go and are being erased or ignored. Again, this level of misogyny does NOT remain contained to just 1 type of woman.

&gt;Grooming gang crime is upheld by religious extremism. Like Sweden, we must officially recognise this, and work to curb extremist preaching, teach religious counter-narratives, give gendered extremism education and deliver quality relationships education, while learning the lessons from Prevent and Channel. We need a careful, considered approach that is respectful of the human rights of everyone.

Yes. Human rights are key. But always choose women over perpetrators."
78,dvxqvjr,"Islamic women are out of discussion because opposing Islamic patriarchy is called islamophobic and racist.

I fear Islam, because by law I'm identified as a terrorist because I'm an atheist. I am allowed to fear a religion which is allowed to kill me.

A multiracial religion can't be called a race.

"
79,dtdel1a,"&gt; Twice as much in the case of women and around half as much for men is slightly? We obviously have a different definition for that word. They act as a group. I treat them as one.

16%. 16% of Muslim women are unemployed. 84% of them ARE employed. The overall rate is 12.8% unemployment. That's 87% employment. That means an OVERWHELMING majority of them are working.

The unemployment rate in SPAIN is worse than Muslims in the UK, so do you judge Spanish people more harshly than Muslims?

&gt;But you’re telling me it affects 30% of Muslim women and not other typically non Muslim ethnic groups?

Yes. It's a case of self-fulfilling prophecy. People believe Muslims are more likely to be unemployed, therefore, they harbour some hatred for them, then employers begin to discriminate against them, so they find it harder to get jobs. This hatred has been festering in this country for years. Want to know the real, genuine solution? Stop harbouring racism. Then they won't feel like they're being discriminated against.

&gt;But you’re telling me it affects 30% of Muslim women and not other typically non Muslim ethnic groups?

It does affect other groups, which you can measure. The reason it doesn't affect other groups as much is because we got used to them and stopped being so racist, so the situation improved over time, like it already is now.

&gt;And I’m saying the trend says it isn’t as overall unemployment fall. As the link indicated.

And I'm saying Muslim unemployment has decreased FASTER than regular unemployment, as YOUR link indicates.

UK unemployment 2011-15 - 8%-5.4%

Muslim unemployment rate 2011-15 - 17.2%-12.8%

Overall decrease: 2.6%

Overall Muslim decrease 4.4%

&gt;But understandably women do tend to either have to or choose to stay at home. 

THIS IS WHAT I DON'T GET. You're SO understanding of the difference in our native population, but when it comes to Muslims you are entirely unforgiving.

&gt;I disagree. Nobody’s free to move to a place we ‘own’.

Yes but you don't own the entire land. You own your land. SO, you can legally keep Muslims away from your property, but nothing else. There is no claim to country-sized land by an individual, the land is owned by people, so when the people are at peace there is no need to have borders.

&gt; Surely the argument is for smaller states if anything.

The argument is a persons limits shouldn't end at the border. Imagine if you lived in a situation where you literally could not leave your country. Would you be okay with that? Because that's the extreme side of your view. The extreme side of my view on the other hand, is total freedom.

&gt;Means a pretty weak rule of law. 

Not even remotely. The law would not change, the police would not change, only the borders.

&gt; You’re merely advocating for a world order.

I'm advocating for world freedom. Rights for every human. Nothing else would change. Countries can stay, just an overarching body (like the UN) with the legal power to enforce rights and freedom over all countries.

&gt;Well actually there is.

No, there is no objective measure of ""britishness"". Is a man who was born in britain his entire life, but rescinded citizenship to live in Germany when he turned 70, still British? How about a German, born in Germany to German parents, but lived in Britain his entire life since he was 2, is he British? Is he more or less British than the man without citizenship? How a bout a 3rd generation British immigrant to Sweden, compared with a 3rd generation Swedish immigrant to Britain? The Brit in Sweden still has more British blood in his veins, but the Swede in Britain has lived in Britain, which is more British?

The answer is there is no answer, because you cannot say with any OBJECTIVE measure, than someone is ""British"". Citizenship is subjective, blood is subjective, cultural-upbringing is subjective. That's my point.

&gt;No there isn’t. Wealthy countries can’t even look up the elderly.

Because all the money is in the hands of the rich. There is MORE than enough money to look after everyone, we as a nation just refuse to redistribute it from the people who have it to the people who need it. THAT is the only reason the elderly suffer in this country. Nothing else. It's because millionaires pay lower tax rates than the middle-class because they hide their money overseas.

&gt; Never mind look after more useless people.

They are not useless. 12.8% of them are unemployed, that is it.

&gt;How does that percentage look after the rest.

Through redistributing wealth.

&gt; Money isn’t the problem. It’s the lack of manpower

The irony of ignoring the manpower we could potentially get from these poorer countries... 

&gt;I’d feel perfectly fine keeping some white people out.

Which white people?

&gt;I suppose if you say something enough it must be true.

If something is measurably true, it's true. For example, unemployment rates for Muslims falling, the world becoming more peaceful, the rich gaining larger chunks of money from the people.

&gt;I judge swathes of people based on their ideology. 

Are the British people one single ideology to you? Surely you've lived here long enough to see the divide between North and South? Welsh and English? Tory and Labour? Of course we are not one ideology, so why the hell do you judge the 10+ muslim countries as one ideology, whilst judging Brits as individuals?

&gt; You’ve met western Muslims. Much of which aren’t like most Muslims round the world and shouldn’t really classify as such. 

NO, THEY ARE STILL MUSLIMS. Okay let's go about this another way. In what way do you believe Islam is a bad religion, what particular way? The Quran having a few shit verses? The bible literally lays down laws for regulating slavery at one point, doesn't mean the religion necessarily follows. Religions can change, but they change by the people changing. 

Look at it this way, historically christians were a violent bunch of cunts, starting literally Europe-wide wars over their religion, that's pretty violent right? But they became more peaceful. HOWEVER, we don't stop calling them ""christian"" because they became more peaceful, do we? Ergo, someone can be christian and peaceful, just as somebody can be Muslim and peaceful. Do you agree?

&gt;Being ‘peaceful’ isn’t the only thing I look for tbh.

I know, I was just using it as a catch-all term for opposing some of the shitty things that happen in the region.

&gt;So would you treat a Nazi as an individual?

I would try and convince him he is wrong rather than immediately trying to get rid of him. If he actively committed terrorist acts or planned on it I would have no issue with him being killed. Here's a better question, do you consider a German citizen being drafted into the military by force a ""nazi""? Because most Muslims were simply born into that culture, just as some ""Nazis"" were. Just as Christians are. But people change. Atheism is a rising ""non-religion"", and many Muslims are converting to either christianity or atheism, simply because of the lack of stable religious foundation in our country. THAT is an example of the power of OUR culture, to change their culture. Because their culture is shifting towards ours FAR more than ours is shifting towards theirs, wouldn't you agree? So it is a net benefit to have them exposed to our culture in this way.

&gt;I don’t see why I should support a group of people who show a lack of respect to women and believe in a sky fairy.

Well the sky fairy is pretty prominent in this country anyway unfortunate. In addition, it isn't about showing support for their culture, it's about exposing them to OUR culture. I'm not agreeing with their particular culture by having them over here, I'm just giving them the benefit of the doubt that they will become more peaceful/nicer if they are exposed to our culture, rather than if they were left in their own countries.

&gt;London is a desolate place

It's clearly not since it's literally still one of the worlds most powerful cities. Perhaps flooding particular cities with them was a bad way of going about it though, so I would advocate a program that helps spread them around major cities nearby.

&gt;I don’t feel cool about it.

Fair enough, but the best way of going about it in my view are programs that help integrate them into our society. Kicking them out just creates resentment and hatred, which is what we are trying to avoid. So perhaps programs that teach English directly to them in school or even adult education in libraries or classrooms. What do you think the best solution is?"

&gt;Because they fucking flew airliners into skyscrappers and celebrated the fucking event! They attack concerts and nightclubs and bomb coffee shops. They murder Olympic athletes. They murder their own people in places like Iraq and lay those bodies at the feet of Americans that were just trying to help. 
Their Idea of a society is NOT ONE THAT I WANT TO LIVE IN.

Again, ""they"" didn't do this. A tiny section of another section of their religious group did this. You can't use ""they"" to describe a population this large. (And I know, ha-ha, you ""just did,"" but can we stop going around in circles here?)

Yeah, their idea of society is not the one I want to live in either. Thank God they aren't forcing it on us.

&gt;The americans that were just trying to help.

That's a very naïve way to look at it. The situation's a bit greyer than that.

&gt;If they live by our rules, they'll prosper. If they bring their rules here, they'll make us poor. Their ways are not our ways. Their culture is not our culture. Our culture is the dominant successful one, theirs leads to poverty and torment.

What you don't seem to get is that these Muslims trying to escape the middle east are escaping precisely to get away from the sort of strict, regressive ideals that you hate so much. How often do you get talk to an actual muslim person, anyway? Have you ever actually sat down and had a conversation with one of them? Because I can't imagine you saying these things if you had. It's much harder to demonize someone when you see them everyday. And I can tell you, having worked in customer service for four+ years, muslim women are by far the most consistently polite and respectful customers I've ever had the pleasure to deal with. Literally, I have never met a rude one."
81,dub45ko,"Nowhere in the time of the muslim prophet did the jews and christians know persecution, and nowadays those who are persecuted are in poor countries (notice even muslims are persecuted there). Moderates are muslims not seculare (very far from being secular). Yes, if you oblige a woman to cover it is oppression, but if she WANT to wear it as a faith act, it is her choice, and don't oppress her to remove it. The ones who bother non-muslim women are ignorant fools, they watched too much porn, and think every white woman is a pornstar. For the killings ? where? when? I have never heard of those. Islam does nowhere ask to cut women, no texts. Circuncision exists for boys only (similar to judaism). Fake news have been exposed many times (search for it on youtube), even Trump called them ""fake news"". They show islam only when they cover terrorists, do they show good muslim citizens ? no. Do they show muslim scientists ? no, Do they show angry extremists? a lot...So, fake news. 19 yo is a teenager, is he a scholar muslim ? no, I at his age don't even know fully my own religion, it will be arrogant to say that a 19 yo understands islam, he has been manipulated perhaps by extremists. There is heaven for many people (not only muslims). And the muslim prophet was not a pedophile, many studies have shown that his youngest wife was 19. Murderer? No. Muslims at the time were at war with polytheists (idole worshipers). When there is war, there is killing in bith sides. You can't blame islam for it, as they had noble ethics."

Point four, the article you've linked actually supports my point, not yours, as it says the reason so many Muslim women are unemployed is because of racism and islamophobia when they try to apply for a job.

Point five, Black people are also a far bigger portion of the US prison population compared to population in general, are you suggesting they should be discriminated against? As for your point about Terrorism prisoners, how exactly is that anything someone would not expect?

84,dsntbae,"&gt;leave your bs to others.

The sad thing is that Im not even saying anything. There's this thing called the burden of proof which only rational people tend to absorb, but I'll give you a chance. Basically, the claimant has to support his crap by this beeautiful thing we usually refer to as ""evidence."" Now it's that difficult to understand, but some people just fail to process it. But I'll help, I'll see whether I can stuff it in that fat head of yours. 

Let's start with Iran. There's this thing which only the intellectuals who can google stuff know, called the [Kashf e hijab,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashf-e_hijab)
in which the secular, tolerant, and ""western"" government, basically tries to beat the shit out of every single lady who dares wear a fucking cloth on her head. Many commit suicide - um, not because their parents forced them to - and well, around 500 people get killed in protests - um, not because their parents killed them. Now, 500 is not a lot to many, I mean, we have to save the women being forced to wear a stupid cloth, henceforth we have to kill them. 

I decided to check the amount of women killed in the protests against the hijab. Maybe I'd find some evidence that women are slaughtered here and there for wearing a stupid cloth. Surprisingly, there is none. I can't even make a comparison to anything because there's nothing there to begin with. Holy shit, this is almost comical. I decided to take the amount of protests happening today, and around 12 people have died. Usually, Id say 500 is a bigger number, but Ill let the arab speak.

I don't know, are arabs retarded, or is there some magical thing which only arabs can see that proves that majority of muslim women are oppressed, which I obviously can't find at all?  I mean, since most terrorists do turn out to be arabs, I can believe the latter, arabs are dipshits. But Islam is not a race, and arabs dont make up that big of a demographic among muslims anyway, I'll actually listen to rational evidence.

85,dstm47b,"&gt; What we want to do is embrace the progressive ideologies within Islam, the moderates, and shun the backward ones

Judging by Trudeau's reintegration of the brave ISIL fighters (just puked in my mouth a little bit) beheading in the name of the religion of peace I don't think we are doing a very good job of shunning the backwards one. Trying to secretly give $10 million to a terrorist who killed an American soldier isn't either.


&lt; Again, our rule of law is sound, so these barbaric cultural practices will just dissipate here.

If you arbitrarily dismiss the internationally-respected Pew Research Centre then what other sources should we turn to? Their research is frequently cited in peer-reviewed papers written by senior academics. You must be some kind of ivory tower academic elitist to discredit the works of the professors of all kinds of fields worldwide.
The mental gymnastics you use to dismiss raw, unbiased data as unreliable is impressive, vague and confusing. Please provide data that refutes the Pew polls and UK government census, I am keen to see it.


It's not about refuting the stats you're providing. Someone once said ""There are lies, damned lies and statistics"" for a very good reason. You're picking and choosing your stats according to what suits the end conclusion you want to prove. I think a telling sign is you keep linking to the pew website yet fail to link directly to the study you claim you're taking the figures from.

Lets make this simple. Starting with your own list:

&gt;Most UK Muslims believe homosexuality should be illegal.

What is ""most"". You're the one using words like ""vague"" for me right?

&gt;Most UK Muslims wouldn't report a suspected terrorist.

Again ""Most"", what does it mean? and link for these two claims from sources you claim they came from. 

&gt;The UK Muslim population is 4% but the prison population is 15%.

and? Did you notice the data for Buddhists in the same chart. I bet you didn't because it doesn't allow for the narrative you're peddling (or it is likely you're naive enough to follow the lead from others who are doing this). 

&gt;50% of UK Muslim men and 75% of UK Muslim women are unemployed.

Source? Remember you cited pew or the UK government census for your statements. Just a rough gestimate.....recent figures show there are about 1.4 million unemployed in the UK, now, let me get this straight, you're saying over 1.5 million (not a typo, 2.5 million muslims times (75%+50%)/2) of these are Muslims???? How is that possible??? 1.4 is less than 1.5, right? The WHOLE of the UK unemployed are Muslims? Secret stealth (Sunni???)jihads? 

&gt;UK Muslim families are having between 5-6 children each compared to 1-2 from non-Muslim UK families.

Again, boy o boy, I would love to see the source for this one, this figure would jump out and shock anyone with an iota awareness of demographics. I want to see the UK government census data where you got this number from.

&gt;90% of child grooming gang convicts in the UK are Muslims.

It's not 90%. Having said that I'm not sure what method you're using when presenting 84% as 90% and it points to the underlying bias in your part. You're presentation of the data is not impartial it is cherry picked and geared towards what you want  it to present. Even a clearly high figure of 84% is not good enough for you, you ignored even below GCSE level maths rule and jacked it up to 90%. Again alarm bells here, you claiming to present ""...raw, unbiased data..."" yet you're lying. Clearly. Unless you're citing the 90% figure from a competing government report of which I am not aware in which case I need a linked source. Thanks. Look forward to these so we can clear this up once and for all. At least for you.    "

89,dpurs4x,"&gt; you mean the age of tinder where females are allowed to ride on the cock carousal, sleeping with millions,

I mean a world were women can do what they want. Forcing your opinions of modesty or femininity down the throats of all women is exactly what we did during the dark ages. Yes I consider us to be in enlightened times.

S.N. Akin to what, an age were Muslims whore themselves out on as many female POWs they've enslaved as possible. At least now women are at least given a choice as to what they want.

&gt; and then marry a betabux for money to get them into cuckolding so they can sleep with a 6ft Chad with blue eyes and abs again like how they slept around since when they were 13 years old?

Why do u assume all non-Muslim women are lecherous whores. This is both naive and disconcerting. Firstly, women have different types, I'm sure there's some out there that even find u attractive. Secondly, it's illegal to sleep with someone at 13, unlike in an Islamic country where u can f*ck anyone at any age. U think saying we're married and claiming god wants this makes sleeping with a 13 year old any better, talk about disgusting reasoning.

&gt;And then get abortions cause ""killing babies"" doesnt mean a thing to them. 

I'm not gonna get into this argument, but if Allah really wanted the baby to live he wouldn't have let anyone abort it. If your all powerful god decreed it was time for it to die (because he has prophecised everything, everyone does) how can u condemn any woman for doing so when it was by your gods will.

&gt; And then accuse the betabux of rape to get more money out of him and then ultimately send him to jail for years on end cause he doesnt meet 6ft Chad standards and his life doesnt mean anything to her. but we still believe on ""her side"".

What the f*ck is wrong with u, there are women who've literally been raped, been abused, been tortured &amp; u have the gall to assume all of em are lying for money. What is it only not rape when the perpetrator is rich? what if a poor man raped a woman? u think she wanted it. Why would the man who raped her mean anything to her? Sure there are some who do this, but at least we live in a time were people who're actually raped are treated civility and kindness, instead of in an Islamic world were they would be forced to marry their rapist.

&gt; But ""Oh No"" we cant have the dangerous mentality of stoning their wife/husband to death when cheating with 4 wtinesses and proof because marriage isnt sacred, am i right? we cant have the 100 lashes for when a guy/girl sleeps around without getting married. ""Oh No"" Dangerous mentality cause we gotta be ""sex positive"" by showing our kids how its really done by sleeping around with every thing and everyone you see.

why are u so obsessed with sex or women cheating? Did your SO cheat on u are something? regardless that's not grounds for execution. Let that person atone, let them try to better themselves, why do u get to take the matter into your own hand and end their lives. Secondly what about men, do u consider them sleeping with multiple wives cheating, how is polygamy any different.

S.N. What's wrong with sex exactly, it feels good, it's beneficial for your body and if u do it safely, there's no side affects.

&gt; Cause we care about society and its need to get fucked in the ass a million times over before we actually learn anything.

Funny, I was thinking the same about letting Islam get off scott free after mass producing terrorists again and again.

&gt; I believe ""all life is precious"" thats why we call muslims ""sand niggers"" and hate on jews and everyone that is a slut shaming asshole, because we take pride on our women riding the cock carousal and we encourage it. because we are cucks that support cuckolding and accept the need of our wifes hypergamy needs, of letting them ride on 6ft Chad/Tyrones cock. We believe in our wives need to ride on 6ft Chad/Tyrones cock, because marriage is sacred.

Wow, I've never used this before but you're a literal imbecile aren't u? You're so closed off from the rest of the world that you aren't content with just leaving happy people as they are and would rather ruin everything for them to conform to your meaningless interpretations of whats right and proper.

You are just another Islamist apologist that’s busy calling everyone racist &amp; bigoted rather than take responsibility for the actions of your community. I’ve grown up in India dude, interacted em with Muslims. It’s the same story everywhere, I’ll never find a more intolerant group of people anywhere in the world. If you want to contribute to society, start by reforming your violent &amp; hateful religion and then come back to me.

90% of all terrorist attacks worldwide are carried out by your co-religionists. Be it Russia, India, China, Middle East, Europe, the story is the same."
91,do0aodl,"Im sorry,  but every sentence in your post is wrong and here is why.

Face veiling is a religious tradition going back to the first generation of muslims.  What exactly is the political thing of it? If you ask women who wear it,  the most frequent answer will be a religious reason. 

Turkey is a muslim majority country rather than an Islamic one,  one that also banned the headscarf from universities. I believe  the face veil is quite legal to wear. 

Which countries do you think actually force women to wear the burka (its not many)  and how does banning women in Europe exactly attack those countries ? 

 It makes no sense,  unless the policy uses the logic of a terrorist  whereby innocent people are somehow fair game because of their race,  religion or nationality.  In this case 150 or so muslim women are to be punished because islamic state forces women to cover?  

"
92,do47h9u,"Well maybe if people didn't go to places like T_D (or just look at the front page once in a while) and see things like them openly mocking a government agency's program to integrate minorities into their workforces by calling it a terrorist training facility just because Muslim women are in the accompanied photo, they wouldn't have that perception."
93,domcim9,"&gt;Muslim women are the first to take the backlash of such tragedies.

Pretty sure the firsts are the people mangled/shot/blown up.

And the seconds are their relatives and friends.

I always hear this ""after each terrorist attack, peaceful muslims are the ones that have it worse"", but what exactly do you mean by ""backlash""? What discriminations do you personally have to endure? Care to give some descriptions?

Because this all sounds like yet another example of the immense, invincible muslim victimhood complex according to which muslims are always ""oppressed"" and nobody gives a shit about the kuffar."
94,domslvd,"&gt;Do you hate the ex-muslim women who have escaped islam?

Given that ALL adults have agency and are responsible for their own actions: yes - if a Muslim woman willingly promoted, funded or indoctrinated children into the Islamic terrorist ideology... they have willingly participated in a pedophile-terrorist group.

Your naivety is refreshing, however being a cowardly member of a terrorist rape gang doesn't mean you aren't a member of a terrorist rape gang.

I've crossed countries on foot, for fuck sake!

Just because 99.9% of Muslim women are too lazy or too comfortable or too indifferent to cease behaving like disgusting animals, doesn't make their behavior tolerable."
95,donsuea,"Sigh I knew there was going to be at least one of these comments.

Let me define backlash for you (or rather, copy Google's definition): 
""A strong negative reaction by a large number of people, especially to a social or political development.""

I don't think the people getting maimed or killed are receiving any negative reactions from large amounts of people, and neither are their relatives or families. But who does receive negative reactions from large amounts of people right after an attack? Muslims. And not just 'Muslims' no, it's usually women who wear headscarves because they represent Muslims the most in terms of appearance. Muslim men look like any other men, but practicing Muslim women are very distinguishable from the rest of the population.

I never said I've had to endure any discriminations and personally I haven't faced any real discrimination yet (apart from stares and glares and people refusing to enter an empty elevator with me despite them clearly waiting to use one). But that's because I really go out of my way to make sure I don't experience them and I live in an area where there is a large Muslim population. 

We all watch the news. Every time there's a terrorist attack it's the same old thing ""islamophobic hate crimes have risen by 300% this week"". There's Muslim women who have dealt with people yelling verbal abuse and trying to pull off their headscarves, Muslim women who have been stabbed, beaten, even murdered. There was an article the other day about a pregnant Muslim woman who was kicked in the stomach and ended up having a miscarriage. 

Just type ""Muslim woman attack"" into Google and you'll see. How many terrorist attacks have been committed by Muslim women? Yet we have to deal with this shit?

Anyway the point here isn't the backlash. The point is that most Muslim women (and I'm willing to say the large majority) can't do anything about it except hide and pray really. They can't take off their headscarves because it's not really a choice, whether it be as a result of the religion itself or the Islamic culture. But because everyone else thinks it's a choice they see a woman who willfully stands up for things that personally attack them and it makes them understandably angry and take it out on the poor thing who might hate wearing it in the first place. 

By Muslim women I mean women who dress Islamically. I wouldn't be on this sub if I was a fully practicing, fully believing Muslim would I? 

You do know you could feel sympathy and sadness for victims of terrorist attacks/ hate crimes and their families, while simultaneously worrying about your own safety right? Just because you're upset that someone died in a car accident doesn't mean that you're going to stop checking that your kids have their seatbelts on when you drive, or that you're going to stop worrying that you may get into one as well so being extra cautious. 

Well same thing here. 

Hope that explanation helped. "
96,dm7cka2,"&gt; The report says muslims are either seen as disadvantages or a threat from within.

What do u expect, the majority of them refuse to properly interact with the community or non-Muslims and are willing to spend most of their funds on a home around other Muslims; they would rather be penniless alongside other Muslims then financially stable around completely normal, hardworking people. The government while not entirely free of guilt, isn't to blame for this. Muslim immigrants come here expecting to alter the existing infrastructure and societal hierarchy to better suit Muslims and of course they're going to say they feel disadvantaged when they're treated the same as everyone else, they expect the same superiority offered to them in Muslims countries and are disgruntled when given normality alongside other religions and races and ethnicities. Onto the point about threat from within, what do u expect, when they keep pocketing themselves into small boroughs or neighbourhoods where over 70% of the people are Muslim then what do u think the remaining population is going to see them as; looking at this out of context it looks like they're planning to orchestrate an insurgency (though of course they aren't).

&gt; These muslim women are breaking convention.

They do know in any Muslim country, they'd be beheaded or imprisoned for this right. How can they identify as both Muslim women and politically active when the two are completely un-compliment-able. What's the end goal for Muslim rights in the U.K. stopping the Muslim women who advocated for those from advocating for anything else.

&gt; The report shows there is an increasing absence of Muslims in British public life.

Circle back to point 1; case and point.

&gt; I think representation means I myself must dilute my identity to fit within your institution.

Stop being a child. Your complaining that Muslims are not being given the proper rights and are seen as a liability risk etc. yet u refuse to take a political stance and try to convince existing Muslims that they should participate in governmental decisions so as to better they're lifestyle and public treatment. I don't understand if u feel your being treated badly but don't feel u want to make change so u can be treated better, then what do u want? do u want the government to just cash a check and give it to every Muslim that feels bad for the world being the way it is?

&gt; I would rather a Muslim MP would be there representing the Muslim area.

That's discrimination, u would rather we elect a person to a political office for their religious beliefs. The government isn't Scientology, people aren't given jobs for their devotion to god, they're given them for their work ethic and experience. If u want an MP so badly find someone willing to take on such a job, push him into the competition and let the populace decide whether he's appropriate for the job. If he isn't then what right do u have to argue? he was given the same chance as everyone else and either made it or didn't it's as simple as that. Giving privileges to one person because of their religious beliefs stands counter to the equality of man and democracy as a whole.

&gt; In those institutions we've got the likes of siddique khan who doesn't represent our voice and have to do everything to appease the British public eyes.

I understand u feel disparaged but u can't expect a member of government to give u priority over the entire working country. Muslims are a minority and they themselves don't represent Britain as a whole, u can't expect the few to dictate the actions of the many that's just unfair. It's like asking 80% of the country to instil sharia law because 20% wants it, no-ones going to accept that, it's absurd. Besides members of government are meant to be as unbiased and stoic as possible &amp; while no-one has ever truly fitted this description advocating for it's complete abandonment and placing a leader that just makes life better for u is both immature and a risk to the free world, case and point Donald Trump.

&gt; Review your geopolitical ambitions and review your policy. Puts pen down.

So your solution to preventing terrorism is ""Review[ing] your geopolitical ambitions and review[ing] your policy"". What does that even mean, do u want to to let less people into the country, do u want to make the Islamic state the norm and just open our borders to let terrorists in. Review can literally mean anything, I need a little more specificity.

&gt; Prevent says You're meant to look in very young school children for signs of radicalisation.

&gt; How insidious is that.

What do u mean how insidious is that. Islam a religion with history of radicalising it's members and children are the most impressionable demographic that can be targeted. They could be told things from the quran and interpret them to be bible (as all extremists do). They could be taught homosexuality is wrong and all homosexuals should be thrown off buildings; this is entirely based in Islam and monitoring children to make they aren't being taught such hate is both the responsibility of a government which doesn't wish to harbour future terrorists and people in institutions who fear the children they are being trusted to teach are being taught that murder and martyrdom is great.

&gt; What u did when u were 15, you're not that guy when u were 15.

Correct, but if u brutally killed someone for Allah when you were 15, u'd still be in jail regardless of whether u would do it again. The law isn't so conditional that a sudden change in character excuses all previous atrocities.

&gt; There is such a sense of powerlessness, there is such a sense of disenfranchisement that u seek to asset yourself in some way, shape or form. 

A form which is basically just b*tching that the world is unfair and demanding superiority over everyone else. What specifically do u want? Most of the grievances I've heard in this video has been from Muslims insulting these girls for calling out Islam for racism and misogyny; I haven't heard anything about the regular population insulting any of them or calling them out. So what, u want the government to intervene and make all the Muslims who hurt u emotionally cry.

How are Muslims being discriminated against? I mean don't get me wrong obviously they're but shifting the blame onto the government with no actual goals or desires, just plain grievances is absurd. ""The Muslims are being blamed for extremism"" is the main grievance that comes to mind and this isn't so strange when u look at the general frequency of terrorist attacks in the U.K. in the last few months. But what, the Quran is centred around extremist acts and brutal violence, u blame people for being scared of members of religion that proudly proclaims ""Kill all the apostates"" &amp; ""Beat your wives""; even the government can't make people like or defend murderers or rapists (which granted not all Muslims are, but the truly devout ones must be, for that is what their holy prophet was) so what do u expect them to do?

S.N. What's with the whole exercise routine in the gym where they're hitting tires and punching forward with weights whilst wearing a hijab. I don't mean to insult anyone but that seems like a huge safety hazard. What if the hijab turns round and blinds u whilst your holding the hammer and moving your body, what if they hijab gets caught on something and pulls your entire head back; if u want to work out that's fine but don't endanger anyone else in doing so.

S.S.N. Are these the hoejabis u/igotgroped keeps referencing. I haven't had many interaction with people like this, but they appear to be so smug and passive aggressive in how they speak. Like they have a point and are going to express it regardless of what u offer to counter. Many of them throughout the video keep trying to look elsewhere while someone else is talking so that they can just offer a counter argument after they've finished speaking. U can't have a proper conversation or debate with someone who ins't even willing to listen to u."
97,dma84oh,"You're comment is welcoming. I am a Muslim woman. I have been lurking on this sub for quite some time and have always noticed it was a proudly Islamophobic sub. It is infested with sanghis and militant atheists. They speak no evil of any other religions. Even news articles and controversies involving other religions are never posted. Take for example, the killings at Kodinhi where a Muslim convert was hacked to death by his sanghi relatives. But any news depicting Muslims in a negative light is upvoted and has many comments.

Anyways, I am not surprised by this. Having lived in Kerala for the past few years, I noticed the deliberate anti Muslim bias of the media. Muslim issues are doubled up and played again and again. Just few years ago, there was this case of some dogs getting killed somewhere in Malabar. Next day, the media called it terrorist training and they were practicing on dogs. I mean what non sense was that. In many panchayats, dogs were killed due to the stray dog menace. This was done by the authorities and there weren't any ulterior motives. But hey, lets just call all Muslims terrorists. 

Another incident was last year. A couple from Kasargod had moved to Iran in search of better pastures. Next day, media spins it as 'they have gone to join ISIS'. Anyone with some basic knowledge of politics and geopolitics would know that nobody wanting to join ISIS would go to Iran. It is a country at the forefront of defeating ISIS and totally Shia, something ISIS abhors. But hey, the media conveniently twisted it to suit their agenda.And not just the sanghi media, even the ""leftist"" ones. Thankfully, it was Media One that exposed that stupidity. And I guess thats the reason why a lot many hate Media One. Kerala Media was always in the hands of RC Christians and Nairs. Media One allows the Muslim to present his point of view and negate the blatant bias of other outlets.  

https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/isil-in-kerala-a-manufactured-threat-1.40182     

Apparently, Muslims shouldn't even talk about justice. Even that is a crime. And lets not talk about NIA. Its main task right now is to see that Hindu women do not marry Muslim men. Hindu women marrying Muslim men is ""love jihad"" while Hindu men marrying Muslim woman is ""secularism"". Welcome to progressive Kerala. This line of thinking is not an isolated case. Just have a look at your movies. They potray Muslim woman as some kind of subservient creatures waiting for Hindu men to come and free them. Lal Jose is infamous for this line of thinking. Every movie of his has to have this theme. Also, the last few years, they have objectified Muslim women. Starting with Thattathin Maryathu. In that movie, all of a sudden the Hindu family is all welcoming while the Muslim family is regressive. This inspite of the fact in Kerala, inter caste marriages are quite low. Nairs rarely marry Ezhavas and Dalits. A collegemate's dad did not allow her to marry her boyfriend who was a Ezhava. And her Dad was an army man. But hey, that's not important for them. Running the misogynist Muslim theme is more important. This inspite of the fact that higher education enrollment is quite high among Muslim women in Kerala.

Muslim women are increasing their participation in the workforce. But what bothers the sanghis and militant atheists is that this hasn't come at the expense of religion. From their point of view, Muslims should have to give up their religion if they want to be part of society while the rest can keep it and strut it. 

Kerala is no bastion of secularism and tolerance. It has the highest number of RSS shakhas. Apparently, that is fine. But a Muslim opening a religious school is a crime. This hypocrisy is something I have noticed time and again. And the more I see it I realise why Muslims need to organise themselves. They seem to be divided on the basis of simple theological differences. Things are only going to get worse from here. There is rampant Islamophobia along with brazen intolerance.

As a Muslim woman, I am happy SDPI exists. It is a mandatory antidote to RSS. As long as they and their brand of Hindutva exists, SDPI is indeed needed. Any Muslim woman who has doubts on that, just read through reports on riot cases in North India. In every anti Muslim pogrom, women are specifically targeted. The Hindutva brigade looks at Muslim women as cattle that needs to be disrobed and dishonoured to show power. If you watch some of the ""new generation"" movies, they too promote it in a subtle manner.

All in all, last few years have made me more aware of my Muslim identity, something that seems to be threatened. I have become more religious. And I sport a hijab at all times. I come from a liberal family where none of the women used to wear hijabs. But gradually things are changing and am happy for it.  "

Channel 4 News has been criticised for giving a platform to a racist Islamist who has previously declared her hatred of “honkies” and “Israeli parasites” and her support for terrorists.

The woman introduced herself in the report showcasing Muslim women “who reject stereotypes” by saying: “My name is Nadia Chan and I have a masters in law. I describe myself as an anti-colonial Islamist.”

Viewers who looked Ms Chan up online following the broadcast last Thursday found a Twitter account packed with racial slurs against white and mixed-race people, support for terrorism and anti-Israel invective.

The account has subsequently been removed from the site.

The Guido Fawkes political blog found that she had also appeared on Iran-backed Press TVUK to praise “the armed resistance from the Islamic Jihad . . . and also Hamas” in Israel. She suggested that Palestinians should use “everyday items to resist, whether it’s knives, cars . . . everyday items to strike the fear in the hearts of their oppressors”.


Following the deadly terrorist attack in Barcelona on August 17 and the subsequent shooting by Spanish police of five suspects, she tweeted: “WTF 5 suspects shot dead in Spain? No due process. Nothing.”

Criticised by another Twitter user, who asserted in his response that Islam was not a religion of peace, she replied: “Listen honkie, your kind are murderous and genocidal maniacs. All whites are the police and Europe is paying for its colonial crimes.”

The Channel 4 News report featuring Ms Chan opened with a voiceover from the reporter Assed Baig saying: “Stereotypes portray them as weak and meek. But this group of Muslim women don’t accept that. Like many young people, they don’t feel that their voices are represented in the mainstream.”

After footage of the featured women lifting weights and throwing punches in a boxing ring, the interviews began with Ms Chan saying: “I don’t want to be represented by British society.”

Asked whether greater representation, in the form of “more Muslim MPs, more Muslims in public life, more Muslims in the media”, would change the situation for Muslims in the UK, she replied: “No! Of course not. I think that representation means that I, myself, will dilute my identity to fit within an institution . . . In those institutions we’ve got the likes of Sadiq Khan [the London mayor] who don’t represent our voice and they have to do everything to appease the British public at large.”

Channel 4 News subsequently promoted the report online, tweeting: “These Muslim women are fighting back by rejecting stereotypes and shaping the discussion on what matters to them.”

However, there was an angry backlash from viewers, with one writing: “Wow, do you do any research into who you’re interviewing? Nadia Chan is a crazy racist; you want her to speak for Muslims? Shocking.”

The programme has now dropped the report from its All 4 TV on-demand service and tweets promoting it have been removed. Assed Baig denied reports that he left the programme as a result of the piece. He said he left on August 9, before the report went out. “My decision to leave has nothing to do with that piece, nor was I forced out in any way,” he tweeted.

A spokesman for Channel 4 News said: “Last Thursday [we] broadcast a report looking at the role of Muslim women in British society. Following inflammatory comments made online by one of the women featured after the pre-recorded interview took place, we decided to remove the piece while we investigate further.”"
99,dmf5m6f,"I've lived in Muslim communities in East Jakarta, Indonesia and New Delhi, India and the uncomfortable truth is that the Muslim women are just as feral and the Muslim men: [they are the ones who lick their lips at the idea their children will become suicide bombers and when they do, the mothers refer to the terrorist attack as their child's ""wedding day"".](http://palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=479)

My Hindu friend and I regularly sat in a cafe on Main Bazar Road in New Delhi and regularly I'd ask him to eavesdrop on what the  Muslim women were talking about and translate for me... and EVERY TIME, without fail, those Muslim unemployed Muslim women were berating the Hindu women either inside the cafe or outside in the street. They'd fantasies about how the unbelievers deserved to be raped to death and sent to hell to be tortured forever: to have their bodies burned and to be trampled to death by the hooves of donkeys. They'd even judge other Muslim women by the size of the slit in their naquib.

Repeatedly they'd refer to other women as boiled sugar than fell in dirt / filth / shit *(I think that was a cultural reference to the Koran or a poem or something because it came up often)* while referring to themselves as delicious and exotic chocolates fit only for Muslim royalty.

The common denominator was that they were all feral animals, subhuman filth."
100,dmtr7pu,"You're absolutely right about how people generalize Muslims as if they have a hive mentality.  Some common misconceptions is that all Muslim women are forced to wear hijab, all Muslim men beat their wives and disrespect women, and all Muslims are either terrorists or sympathetic to them. I live in the ME and when I say this isn't true, they simply don't believe.  I can see on my streets a woman in full niqab,  a woman in a scarf, and a woman in short sleeves and tight skinny jeans. All peacefully coexisting with no drama. Oh yeah, and no one got stoned or beheaded.

"
101,dlkmi99,"1) Just because I don't automatically equate a woman wearing a hijab with someone who hates gays does not mean I'm anti-left.  As someone who lives in Canada, I have friends who are Muslim, one occasionally wears a hijab, and neither of them are anything close to being bigoted. 

2) By painting all Muslims with the same brush it only adds fuel to extremists' anti-western propaganda.  You simply cannot fight hate with hate. It's a snake eating its tail.

3) how am I protecting the oppressors here? What have i said in any of my posts that would make you think I'm protecting the bad guys??  Just because i said you can't judge what someone believes simply because they're wearing a hijab.

4) do you know that Muslim women are being attacked in the western world as they go about their days? Innocent women, riding the subway, walking to work, etc. based not on who they actually are as individuals, but solely on who they are perceived to be or what some idiot *thinks* they believe Because they're wearing a hijab.  Physically attacked.  If I don't stand up against that sort of thing how can I call myself leftist? I oppose ALL bigotry. I reject the notion that ALL Muslims are bad and that ALL Muslims believe the same thing. I KNOW they do not. 

5) I've repeatedly said I oppose all hateful ideologies. You have an incredibly one-sided view of Islam. I feel horrible for you that you have to live in that situation, but please know that outside of your situation, there ARE many good Muslims.  Again, painting everyone with the same brush only furthers terrorists' agendas and spreads hate and divides humanity into polarized groups. 

6) I completely agree that a lot of people on the left today sort of ""forgive"" Muslims for their bigoted beliefs. This angers me and I've been in quite a few arguments about it - it's almost a condescending attitude - like these same people hate conservative Christianity, but give conservative Islam a free pass, as if Muslims are too stupid to know better. There's also a lot of forgiveness for sexism, because sexism is so pervasive in our world and has been for centuries. If you're unaware, it's not only islam that has extremely misogynistic views. This is nothing new."

103,dkg7d73,"She uses ""Sharia law"" in the same way a Christian would use ""God's law"". This would be more or less the same thing as a Catholic person complaining if someone was banning eating crackers at Mass.

&gt;Yes, you heard that right, she said ""kids are being executed"" because of islamaphobia in an MSNBC interview

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobic_incidents

Scroll down to just the U.S. incidents. She's probably making that sound exaggerated intentionally, but if someone is killed because someone else hates Muslims, ""executed"" is hardly an overreach.

&gt;I should never have to vote for it. I live my life under Sharia law everyday. I don't drink alcohol, don't eat pork, I follow Islamic way of living. That's all Sharia law is. it includes process 4 inheritance distribution, marriage contracts. But please let a Christian school a Muslim on Sharia law

Seems like a pretty good point to me.

&gt;If you are still paying interest than Sharia Law hasn't taken over America. #justsaying

Pointing out the idiocy of people freaking over this supposed Sharia take-over also seems legitimate.

&gt;2- She successfully included hijab into the list of progressive symbols through the women's March. I can cite dozens of tweets with her showboating her victory.

Meaning an acceptance of the traditions of other cultures. Not that the hijab itself is a symbol of being progressive, but that wearing one doesn't make you regressive, and supporting someone's choice to wear one doesn't either. Muslim women are still women and should be welcomed into the women's march. That was (obviously) her point.

You can disagree, but don't dishonestly smear and misinterpret this the same way she does *her* opponents.

&gt;3- She has recently started reclaiming words, the most recent and successful one being jihad.

I see no problem with this. The way you make it into what ""crusade"" means nowadays is to use it that way. The way you rob the word of its power is to use it in a less powerful way. Shouldn't you *want* people to be doing this?

I have to say, people freaking out over this seems exactly like SJWs freaking out over the lack of political correctness.

&gt;Sarsour started her speech by thanking Siraj Wajjah, whom Schachtel called “an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombings.” He was a witness on behalf of the Blind Sheikh terrorist, and somebody who has repeatedly embraced the notion of violent jihad. ... She was speaking before INSA, which was founded by Muslim Brotherhood members and was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 2007 Holy Land Foundation terror-funding trial

You'll get no argument from me that these are not the best people in the world, but I'm not going to put a lot of stock into this ""unindicted"" stuff.

&gt;4- Degradation of Ayaam Hirsi Ali in 2011. No, she wasn't in her early twenties then, she was born in 1980, she was 30.

Fair enough, but it's a very minor point, at any rate, and I still consider these to be an extremely tame thing to say, that *no one* here (you in particular, OP) would be bitching about were it said by someone else.

I will again point out the irony of the anti-PC crowd tripping over itself in its rush to be offended by this.

&gt;nytimes.com/2012/08/08/us/08iht-letter08.html

What is this link meant to demonstrate?

&gt;She stated that she was ‘honored and privileged’ to be on stage with Rasmea Odeh who murdered two Israeli students and praised the throwing of rocks at Israeli vehicles.

Rasmea Odeh claims she had nothing to do with it, and that her confession was obtained through torture the Israeli military. I have no idea if this is true, but obviously Sarsour believes her. To put this forth as though Sarsour thinks Rasmea is a murderer but is honored and privileged to stand with her anyway is either dishonest and misleading, or you know something I don't.

&gt;6- Her Saudi comments are open to interpretations but concerning to say the least.

Well, what are they? Considering how often she's complained about Middle-eastern dictators, it's hard for me to imagine she's a fan of the Saudis.

&gt;A big chunk of what she says is actually anti-feministic when it's taken at face value.

Like what? The comments you've linked are about Sharia, but I've never seen her actually endorse the anti-feministic parts of it. And don't get me wrong. Abrahamic religion is the most misogynistic bullshit ever perpetuated on the human race, all of it, but if she just doesn't believe that and ignores the stuff she doesn't like, that makes her dishonest or delusional (which is the way you want religious people interpreting their religions, btw) but not anti-feminist.

&gt;It's not something I can point to with hard evidence but any interview would be enough to get that side of her out,

Certainly not in the only one you linked...

You say below this is meant as evidence for another user, but your last two points are wholly unsupported.

Okay, look. Sarsour is dishonest and she smears people she disagrees with and she should be criticized for that. She seems to think every shady person she's involved with has just been smeared the same way she smears people (maybe that's why she finds it acceptable, even; fight fire with fire). She has a silly but benign interpretation of Islam (which, if you're going to be religious, is a good thing). I don't like her, but I'm not totally convinced she does more harm than good. Because anti-Muslim bigotry actually is a problem and actually does need a light shone on it, and moderate Muslims do need to be accepted and considered normal. Does her so-so effectiveness at this make up for her lies and dishonest attacks? I don't think so. But you don't have to pretend like she's Osama Fem Laden to attack her."
104,dkle7f7,"I know peer pressure exists everywhere, Islam included, my problem is that some people here are trying to act like white knights saying Muslim women are oppressed, they say it as if it's the general rule, when the reality is so complicated to sum up in one sentence. Some places are good (North Africa and the Levant) and some are bad (Saudi Arabia and Pakistan). Islam exists in both places. So the solution as you say is more proper education, not Saudi radicalization.


I agree it's a complex situation, but for starters, Western governments can stop funding terrorists and governments that support them, but sadly this won't stop anytime soon. Al-Qaeda appeared in Afghanistan thanks to American, Saudi and Pakistani funding after all."

106,div3zvs,"Yeah, and I studied Abrahamic religion for six years during college. 

It is a fact that thousands of Muslim women are murdered by their families every year in ""honor crimes"", their killers are not considered terrorists, and they are generally justified in court by the legal authorities of Islamic countries because honor crimes are a cultural norm. How can facts be bigotry?"
107,divlw2c,"Does anyone remember [the case of Shaima Al-Awadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Shaima_Alawadi)? She was the Muslim woman in California who was murdered by her husband for wanting a divorce. The case was famous because the husband wrote a note saying ""Go back to your country, you terrorist.""

What's very telling about all this is that it's not just ""radical"" Muslims but ""moderates"" living in the US know well that Americans and other Western civilizations have a strong sense of social justice and compassion for minorities. Muslim women  are happy to appeal to American pluralism to accept *their* culture as ""equals"", but in secret they don't hold the same respect for us because of their religious inferiority complex."
108,dj6hyx6,"I think you need to do some reading. The issues you've presented among muslims are things that are not in the majority. White Christianity has similar issues in the minority as well. Millions, if not billions of muslims are peaceful practitioners who cherish the women and people in their lives exactly as you do. By your logic, all muslims are terrorists too because the extremists of this religion warp their scripture to fit their agenda. Can you now see how wrong you are when I put it like that? Not all muslims are terrorists, and not all Muslim women are oppressed victims. Both of those things are statistically in the vast minority. 

It looks like you're one of those people who gets uncomfortable when something isn't about you. This Muslim line isn't meant for you. You should never have to wear it or purchase it. H&amp;M admittedly recognizes that it's clothes can be multicultural in an extremely limited sense, but if I were Muslim I wouldn't want to shop for clothes where my use case was merely an afterthought. 

You have an issue with muslims being represented in the world and that's just plain wrong. "
109,djass9c,"Muslim women are worse because they make more terrorists. Someone is raising these terrorists, and it seems to be muslim women."
110,dgveaar,"You don't seem to understand my argument. In the US Muslims make up 1% of the population. Men make up 50% of the population. Men, as a group don't commit 50 times as many terrorist attacks or kill 50 times as many people as Muslims.

And Muslim women are far more dangerous than non-Muslim women. "
111,dh23x49,"I don't know of any laws, but France bans the covering of faces, and ban all religious symbols in public schools. I think it deals more with that women should be able to choose what to wear and not harassed because of it. Women getting called terrorists, having their hijabs pulled off, and even violence towards muslim women are issues.


It also has to do with cross sectionality in feminism, as a lot of early feminism focused on white women and excluded women of color. I've seen similar posters with black and latina women as well."
112,dhj2dbv,Most Muslim women are liberal and don't do the terrorist attacks
113,di1341r,"&gt; I agree, Muslims aren't held to the same standards as Christians. I'm a ""moderate Muslim"" and I'm constantly having to explain and apologize for things that I didn't do or endorse, like the crimes of some terrorist assholes that don't represent me or my faith at all.

I just read it, actully what the poster meant  muslims in the west can be more machists than christians because it's seen as their cultural heritage and western feminists do not complain about many abuses muslim women are subject to in spite of compromise and hospitality while if it were done by a christian they would be enraged. This mainly because politically the fight against islam is being hijaked by the right wing groups. So when hundreds of young muslim sexually assoulted and raped in groups german women in Kholn feminists went to protest against islamophobia, even if the numbers of the crimes perpetrated demostrate they were not just fringed individuals but the result of their culture."
114,di1tqql,"This is just getting ridiculous now.

I'm as angry as anyone that this terrorist killed people in my city. It could have been me. I was there a few days earlier. It's not like we Muslims live in different cities from the ones targeted by these people. 

It's a particularly sickening attack for many reasons. And I've not really gotten over it and don't think I will for a while. This is an attempt to rip our Mancunian community apart, and our British community apart.

But scapegoating has to stop. There's a reason this thing is a blog. Any outlet would destroy its reputation publishing this. Because we are angry too. We Muslims are angry. 

The perpetrator openly hated what Didsbury mosque preached. He was reported on numerous separate occasions, by fellow college students and by Muslims. Now we are to blame as a community? Now Muslim women are targeted (for some reason men are never targeted - because racists are also sexist seemingly and like to be what they are to those they think are defenseless). Why the hell was nothing done when this guy was being reported for years?

Didsbury mosque is mainstream, and if you were to argue it has a bias it would be an ikhwani tint. Look up the coup in Egypt if you want to understand how ridiculous it is to conflate that with Wahhabism.

Isis isn't Wahabi or Ikhwani or Salafi. It's a splinter deviant extreme ideology known as the Khawarij. They believe in killing anyone who doesn't join them and are wreaking havoc across the Middle East (largely due to UK foreign policy, in Iraq and Libya, both countries where this had never existed). The C4 interview in Rusholme has fresh-off-the-boat immigrants not making as big a deal as you might expect because their relatives back home live with the extremism these people wreak on them daily, in addition to western strikes in some cases taking 'collateral damage'. Mosul's civilians are currently being killed by all sides involved, used as human shields by these extremists and no-shits-given about the civilians living there by the coalition bombing them. 

Didsbury is one of the main centres catering for reverts, and Muslims of all backgrounds. I don't just say that as a cliché; many mosques in the UK are specific to Pakistanis, or Bengalis. This one is genuinely as close as you get to a British mosque. It hosts thousands of Muslims weekly and it's not an exaggeration to say almost every Muslim who's lived in South Manchester for a couple of years has been there or has some link to it. To suggest it's spreading extremism is an attack on our community, and is targetting our community. It's untrue and I won't sit here reading this bullshit.

I know only one of the three people mentioned (the one who lives in Manchester). You can walk into his class on a weekday night to hear what he says for yourselves. It's available as a bloody podcast for God's sake, it's not some underground sect preaching hate. This is scapegoating and that's why it's not in any actual newspaper.

115,dhh58nq,"I'm focusing on semantics because you *can't use words like ""forcing"" and ""incentivizing"" interchangeably*.  You tried to use misleading ""semantics"" to support your argument.  *It's practically a holocaust*, and the last one killed 40 million people.  

See the problem with using words in the wrong context?  No one in the US is *forced* to wear heels.  Misusing words is wrong, but clearly not a holocaust.  ""Semantics.""   

Women are *forced* to wear burqas.  

&gt;in reality women are being both pressured and forced to dress certain ways in Western Culture as well. 

I never remotely disagreed with that statement.  ""Incentivized"" was the correct term to use -- some aspects of Western culture *incentivize* the wearing of makeup and heels.  

And the pressure's just not the same.  
&gt;&gt;If you come from a typical [American] family, you can wear ~whatever you want, ~whenever you want. At most, you might get teased by schoolmates.
&gt;&gt;The same can't be said for those who choose to disregard strict religious [Islamic] conventions abroad. People are disowned, women are raped, etc.

Are you arguing with this?  Because it is fact.

&gt;Hijab ban has been instituted in a few countries in Europe, 

And there are many restrictive laws in Islamic countries governing what women can and cannot do.  See the link re. rape below.  

&gt;and in the U.S. and in western countries you always run the risk of being attacked as a woman with a hijab, most commonly by groups of men. 

How many times has this happened?  I can find references to ~ten 
 instances online.  

This sounds just like American fear mongering re. Islamic terrorism.  As an American, I'm more likely to be eaten by a shark while swimming in the ocean this year -- than be killed by terrorists.  

As best I can tell, the same probably goes for religiously-motivated attacks on Muslim women.  

&gt;And if you are a Sikh, you run the risk of being killed or beaten to a pulp as well.

I found four references to such attacks in the US and Canada over the past three years.  There are 750,000 Sikhs in the US and Canada, so the incidence is ~1/600,000 per year.  

The average American is approximately 60 times more likely to die in a fatal car crash, which happens at a rate of 1/9,700 per year.  

I don't know what to say here; you're referring to ~a score of reported violent incidents over the past several years, and the summed populations of Sikhs and Muslims in the US and Canada is...750,000+4.35 million.  ~5.1 million.  

You're grasping at straws.  And you're changing the subject.  

In case you forgot, we were talking about how Islamic women are disproportionally pressured to wear hijabs, as opposed to ~heels in Western culture.  "

118,fw9794y,"&gt;No. I would fight for reform in Hinduism if it had been so. Heck, religion be damned. If Indian Law abolishes it, it should criminal for everyone inside India irrespective of religion.

Then is it that you find caste system to be normal or are you being a hypocrite by not fighting against it? Cause it's still there isn't it as an indispensable part of Hinduism? As delusional as it sounds, what you're saying is possible **in a strawberry world**. How will a girl who's devoid of awareness about her rights or education of any sort be able to fight against a deeply rooted societal injustice that has become a norm for them? You're acting as if reforms are bought overnight and that too by the agitation of couple of folks. If you have the power to do so, please abolish cast system from hinduism by tomorrow 6 pm aight?

&gt;My point is that I am responsible for human rights preservation in my country. I can condemn what happens in other countries but I can't do anything unless you want me to start a insurgent group against their state for this cause.
They are a different country whose state decided establish a regime on religious grounds. If muslim women are being oppressed in their country, it is their state's responsibility for following such idiotic policies that lead to this regression in basic human rights.

Yes they should and it's their responsibility not ours, I couldn't agree more. But what you said earlier simply means that religious directives worth more than what's practically right so justice and injustice will be served differently to different individuals depending upon the religion they practice.

&gt;It is different for non-muslims in Pakistan however because even their state doesn't consider them as their own. Hence disallowing them from electorate, etc.

I agree on this.

&gt;You would still call me a moron if I call for worldwide abolishment of Islam+forced reeducation for all muslims because muh muslim oppression so whatever.

Yes I definately would, nothing ever was achieved successfully by force or oppression, it only caused more distress and chaos. And if the world abides by your modus operandi to make world a ""better"" place, then the ones who want peace and nothing else would also be a subject to this method and there are plenty of such folks. Extremism exists in every religion, Islam would be a clear winner it this I know but I still don't agree with your way of dealing radical islamic terrorism.

119,fqcste5,"No. Muslims are not happily living the tradcon dream. They are going down too. I am from a Muslim community and I tell you, they are not. 

Virtually every men short of Sheikh/Sharif tier is starved of sex. They are told to save themselves for marriage, but when they get married their wives weaponize sex against them. Sex after babies comes to a crashing halt and the men are hounded for $$$$ non stop. 

Muslim men are literally raised to become the ultimate beta bux.

What Islam had was not solution, but only stopgap. The Muslim women as a result of beta-buxing their husbands, become mean, bitchy and disloyal, so Islam gives men the three Talq rule. Women being punished for reporting rape is so that the Muslim women would not retroactively accuse of rape after a pump and dump. The super humiliating punishments for adultery is so that the women would not even try to cheat with Muhammad Chad after behind Abdul Betabux's back. 

Men throwing themselves to militarism and terrorism is largely from the abandonment of positive female attention, and even here, Islam offers yet another stopgap - the promise of 72 virgins in Heaven for killing themselves. 

Notice here, 72 virgins. Why virgins? You guessed it...the huge desperation of men wanting virgins that they most likely wouldn't get in the real world. 

The worst of all - in spite of all the stopgaps Muslim women still fantastically manage to skirt around and thot away. Forget non-Muslim women. Muslim women are experts in enacting the dual mating strategy. They will always find a way to do it all and the hide it all afterward."

Even though I may not agree on what they chose o believe or what Muslim women wear, I don’t tend to force others to take off their hijabs or criticizing Islam in front of them.

The only thing I’m concerned about is how Muslim women are treated in Middle east or third-world countries where Sharia laws are applied. (Mandatory hijabs, sexism etc) and especially countries with high risks of terrorism as well.

My main problem with the growing is Muslim population is that a lot of them hold non-Muslims in contempt and see them as lesser beings, all non-Muslim women are viewed as whores etc. Muslims are vastly overrepresented in violent crimes like random stabbings or rapes and I think the disdain for infidels plays a part in this. 

On top of that you have the terrorism.

All in all, I think Islam is a violent, totalitarian ideology that needs to be removed from Europe. Either by deporting the people or by re-educating them (similar to the Denazification after WW2 we could try a Deislamization)."

And it‘s fine. My problem with those comments is that people basically say every muslim is bad and the religion is the reason behind terrorism. Terrorism has no religion and isn‘t practiced because some holy book tells you to. It‘s people using it to harm others. And that is not right. 

Yes, in arabic countries women are treated in an other way than you know.  There are countries like Turkey, Bosnia, Albania where muslim women are treated in a „good way“ despite being muslim, believe me. But culture in arabic and idk what countries is different. There are catholic/jewish/orthodox etc. people all around the world who treat their women in a bad way as well. You cant say every muslim wife/woman is suffering. 

Islam is all about peace and forbids things that harm you. And if some idiots mean to use a religion to harm others and spread hate and war, it is wrong. I hope I could explain that properly to you. My english isnt best, its my third language and I‘m still in school haha."
126,ey2ulwd,"&gt;‘Saving Muslim women’ is a fig leaf for domination, and the BJP has used this narrative to pass the triple talaq law and justify its actions in Kashmir.

&gt;It’s a deluge. The end of the world as we knew it. And Muslim women are being saved at such speed in India that it takes our breath away. Those who found no place in Noah’s first ark are queuing up in hope of a second coming.

&gt;And liberation is a cometh as surely as a kick in the pants. First, we had the spectre of merry bands of Muslim women, skipping through the streets of India, distributing laddoos in celebration of the triple talaq law, and now, Kashmiri women too face imminent liberation. Thanks to the information blackout, they just don’t know it yet. But here’s what their deliverance could look like:

&gt;&gt;…We’ve seen the pictures of joy when we liberated city after city in Afghanistan. And none of us will ever forget the laughter and the music and the cheering and the clapping at a stadium that was once used for public execution.

&gt;&gt;Children now fly kites and they play games. Women now come out of their homes from house arrest, able to walk the streets without chaperons. “It feels like we’ve all been released from prison,” said one young person in Kabul, “that the whole of Afghanistan has been released from prison.”

&gt;&gt;George W. Bush, US President, December 12, 2001
&gt;&gt;(Months after the US invasion of Afghanistan in what was called Operation Enduring Freedom)

&gt;‘Saving women’ has long been a fig leaf for domination. Virtuous duty, masking imperialist intent. That was colonialism. The white man’s civilising burden included saving brown women (from brown men), and from their barbaric customs. It wrought havoc around the globe. European colonisers appropriated other people’s lands and resources under a banner held aloft saying, “Enlightenment.” They called violence the spread of civilisation and progress. It was justified because it was sold as a moral project.

&gt;The modern iteration of this is ‘Saving Muslim Women’. When for the first time in US history, a first lady, Laura Bush, took over the president’s weekly radio address (the Mann Ki Baat equivalent) on November 17, 2001, the purpose was to bring into sharp focus a core narrative of that war – carry freedom to Afghan Muslim women. She said:

&gt;&gt;We respect our mothers, our sisters and daughters… Fighting brutality against women and children is not the expression of a specific culture; it’s the acceptance of our common humanity, a commitment shared by people of good will on every continent. Because of our recent military gains, in much of Afghanistan women are no longer imprisoned in their homes. They can listen to music and teach their daughters without fear of punishment. The fight against terrorism is also a fight for the rights and dignity of women.

&gt;A CIA memo, available on Wikileaks, which describes it as a “recipe for the targeted manipulation of public opinion in two NATO ally countries,” tells us how important the ‘oppressed Afghan women’ were to sell the war to Europe. The memo says, “… Media events that feature testimonials by Afghan women would be most effective…” And, “Afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing the ISAF [NATO-led International Security Assistance Force] role in combating the Taliban … and could help to overcome pervasive scepticism among women in Western Europe toward the ISAF mission.”

&gt;The triple talaq law

&gt;The narrative is global. It has justified military interventions in many countries, and secured political gains. This spin is what the BJP has used to its advantage. Project: Save Muslim Women is what sold that dangerous and absurd piece of legislation called the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 (i.e. the Triple Talaq Act) to this country.

&gt;After the Supreme Court in 2017 had already made the pronouncement of talaq-e-biddat (saying talaq three times in a single setting) void in law, it was an absurdity to make a person uttering it criminally liable, facing three years of imprisonment. Since 2017, the man could say TTT all he liked, but it did not amount to a legal divorce. To penalize a legally meaningless utterance is ridiculous. To add a criminal element, and jail time is beyond ridiculous, it is completely insane. Plus, the Act is unjust to Muslim women – because how on earth is a man going to provide maintenance to her or his children while incarcerated. Yet somehow, the narrative has sustained itself, somehow Muslim women were saved.

&gt;A week after the Bill became an Act through gazette notification (July 31st, 2019), Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad proclaimed, “Equality at Last” in a signed piece for a mainstream daily.

&gt;He wrote:

&gt;&gt;“The kind of jubilation it has caused across the country, barring conservative elements, indicates how it is a proud moment for India. Our country is transforming and the women of India feel empowered…. It took more than 70 years in India to not only delegitimise this curse, but also provide for penal consequences. Regrettably, this shows the hold the communal and conservative elements continue to exercise over the country’s polity.”

&gt;It was posited as saving Muslim women from ‘communal and conservative’ Muslim men. But sir, what about all the others who opposed this dangerous law? The very evening the Rajya Sabha passed the Bill, a host of prominent civil society citizens, including many Muslim women, issued a public statement outright condemning the Bill as a dangerous, unnecessary and harmful charade.

&gt;Among other things, it said:

&gt;&gt;“You cannot pretend to save Muslim women, while seeking to bring the Muslim community to it knees… Personal laws of all communities are civil matters, not criminal matters. This is the first time in the history of India, that we are witnessing criminal provisions in matters of marriage and divorce. In its intent and target, it is clear that this is not a pro-woman but an anti-minority bill.”

&gt;The honourable law minister would be hard pressed to find one ‘conservative element’ among those who signed it. And yet, the narrative persists: Muslim women were saved.

&gt;The media, for its part, is either stupid or complicit. On August 11, 2019, the Times of India‘s Delhi edition carried a headline story on page 2: ‘First triple talaq arrest in capital: Man Divorced Wife, Threw Her Out of House.’ It tells of a man arrested for divorcing his wife through instant triple talaq, and then forcing her out of their home.

&gt;The story is wrong on fact – because the man did not divorce the woman. He could not. Repeat: Saying “talaq, talaq, talaq” is the equivalent of saying “ABC”. This is not a form of legal divorce as per the Supreme Court judgement of 2017. So she is not divorced, but yes, she has been kicked out of the house.

&gt;Abandonment and destitution is a grave problem for all women. Far greater for Hindu women.  According to the last census, there are 2.3 million separated and abandoned women in India, of which close to 2 million are Hindus. Yet the narrative persists: Muslim women need saving."
127,evzbe37,"&gt;Almost all interviewees agree on the incompatibility between Muslim and Italian identities. Apart from a single exception in which an interviewee said, “you can be both Islamic and Italian, but you cannot be both Italian and Islamist,”[40] the statements are generally more straightforward in their focus on Islam, the religion. One representative of the League stated, “the first word that comes to my mind when I hear ‘Islam’ is ‘terror’” adding that “from a legal point of view, you can be both Islamic and Italian, but from an identitarian point of view, surely not,…Italy is not a fully secular country, Catholicism is the main faith of the country…you cannot be fully an Italian citizen if you have not been baptized.”[41]

&gt;At the same time, nearly all interviewees report either being agnostic, atheist, or do not attend religious services. Neither do they share most of the public positions of the Catholic Church. The League’s electorate in fact shares the low regular religious service attendance rates of the general Italian population at 20 percent, compared to 63 percent among Muslims.“Belonging without believing” is one way of understanding their relationship with Catholicism

You can notice this sort of thing with people like Douglas Murray,who are clearly not religious, yet like the idea of Christianity as cultural bedrock or, perhaps less charitably, as an exclusionary marker with which to distinguish Muslims. 

-------------
&gt;Exclusionary populist parties, such as the League, tend to launch platforms and initiatives emphasizing the necessity of “protecting,” above all, the natives to the detriment of universal welfare programs that also include immigrant residents who are not citizens.[52] One such slogan is “prima gli italiani” (Italians must come first), echoing President Trump’s “America first.”

&gt;Several statements by party activists and members exemplify support for forms of welfare chauvinism. 

Something we see in other countries that are  dealing with diversity via migration. 

&gt;Unlike League supporters, immigration is not equated with terrorism or criminal activity according to most M5S activists interviewed. For example, one stated that, “I do not care about immigration because of its supposed link with terrorism. It is true that, if you do not control immigration, as has happened in parts of Belgium or France, you will have problems, like drug trafficking. However, the issue is much broader and more complex.”[64] Importantly, the M5S interviewees emphasize that immigrants have “rights,” in stark contrast with interviewees from the League, who unanimously stressed that immigrants should have “duties, not rights.” As M5S activists and officials see it, the problem is not immigration per se, but rather that it is not well regulated by Italian law

...

&gt;However, when speaking with representatives and members of the party, a picture quite different from the official one emerges, where, in daily life, pluralism becomes both possible and desirable on the local level. For example, an M5S mayor who I asked about the differences between Western and Islamic values stressed that in his city, “I know several Muslim families. I got along with them, and I still get along with them, men, women…[Muslim] women are valorized here, they are not relegated into some dark room…Our municipality organizes Italian language courses, many people participate, and we encourage them to actively participate in the life of the community.”[87] Similarly, another interviewee said, “I personally know people from different Arab countries that are surely not [extremist]…It is the individual that matters. If they follow common sense and show respect, things work well whatever the specific faith.”

&gt; She sometimes thinks of her ex-husband, Bobby Jenkins, who was killed in an armed robbery in February while making a pizza delivery, and wonders how things might have gone down had he been armed.

""Introducing a gun to the situation just makes things worse. More people would have been put at risk or may have gotten hurt."" This sarcastic remark is not directed to the subject of the article, but the article's author. You subscribe to and support a party who makes this exact argument when it comes to firearms, and here you are, affirming someone doing that exact thing you think makes the situation more dangerous, because they're black, female, and Muslim. Wooten sounds like she's doing good work; you do not.

&gt; “I’m standing up against somebody hurting me or somebody else,” McGahee-Wooten told me this week. “I’m standing up against somebody taking my life. I’m being brave and protecting myself.”

I remember when I used to think like that. . . maybe her intersectionality points will protect her from this shit, but I see a lot of ""please don't draw your gun to protect me from a violent assailant, I'm a pacifist and you're an evil piece of shit for owning a weapon"" remarks directed at her in the future.

&gt; At first, I was taken aback at the sight of her dressed all in black and holding a gun. There are way too many illegal guns on the street, and I’m not for glamorizing gun culture.

But then you saw she wasn't a straight white Christian male and suddenly the gun magically became legal in your eyes. There is no such thing as a fucking ""illegal gun"" you load-swallowing weasel.

&gt; But I could see that many of McGahee-Wooten’s posts promote the accessories she sells to female Muslim gun owners,

Called it.

Hey everyone, we've figured out how to win the gun rights debate; just don't be an evil straight white Christian male when you make your arguments or buy your gun or carry or fucking breathe.

""This just in; defecating now ruled okay upon reveal that black female Muslims do this perfectly normal human thing too."" Again, this is not to cast aspersions on Wooten, she's going good work. My beef is with the moronic author of the article.

&gt; I like that she’s trying to teach women to do things the right way. 

And what is that right way, pray tell? I'm sure with all your years of expertise owning, shooting, smithing, and maintaining weapons qualifies you to tell me what that is, right? Right?

&gt; Too many people obtain guns illegally, 

Yeah, I'm so glad I had someone educate me before I got my first gun. I mean, I was straight-up about to go roll some bitch's house because I just didn't think there was any other way to obtain a weapon. I mean, walk into a store and buy one? Who the fuck would have thought of that on their own. . . 

This is a literal incoherent idea, made so because she needed to crowbar the phrase ""illegal guns"" in there somewhere and couldn't make it work no matter how hard she tried.

&gt; never obtain permits, 

No permit is necessary for exercising a natural human right. All gun laws are infringement. I have a carry permit (license, technically, which is worse, fuck my state) because the people in power make life extraordinarily inconvenient if you carry concealed without one.

&gt; and don’t bother to learn about proper storage or gun safety.

Fuck you, unloaded guns in safes are useless in a home defense scenario.

&gt; “She’s not doing anything other communities aren’t doing,"" Khabir pointed out.

. . . But we're still going to write an article on someone defecating, because it's special when a ""diverse"" person does it, never mind our blatant acknowledgement of the normalcy of the act in the article. . . fuck me.

&gt; All of this information is out there already.

I would imagine some of it is probably tailored, no pun intended, to the specific style of dress common among Muslim women. Otherwise, yeah, that's probably true. That cross-draw in the photo gives me a twitch though.

&gt; She is specifically focused on *her* community.

Ah. Can I focus on *my* community and not be considered a racist, bigoted asshole? What's that? No, because straight white men aren't socially marginalized or oppressed in any way, despite being the demographic with the highest suicide rate, high school drop out rate, lowest percentage of college students and degree holders, and victims of violent crime, and largest demographic suffering from demonstrably proven-false accusations of sexual misconduct?

Okay, just checking.

&gt; At this point, we are active targets for people’s hate and their hate crimes.”

No you're fucking not.

132,en2kddp,"""Are you fucking serious right now? Every member of a grooming gang did it because of ""mental problems""? And there's nothing beyond that? Based on what?""

Do I think you have to have be seriously mentally disturbed to rape children? Yes I do.

""I've already told you that there were cultural and religious elements to their motivations and this has been testified by victims themselves who were directly told by the perpetrators that white non-Muslim women are fair game because they are ""immodest"" and not of the same faith, but you flat out refuse to believe it.""

I absolutely believe that these paedophiles and rapists used their religious beliefs to justify their crimes. Do I believe this is because Islam actually encourages rape and paedophilia? Obviously not, because I'm not a bigoted idiot.

""Either you are Muslim yourself in which case you feel the entire ideology is beyond reproach and obviously very biased or you for some reason just think that ideology can't influence behaviour which is totally ridiculous. So which is it?""

I'm not religious and have no Muslim family. I just hate it when bigots try to target people based off of their religious beliefs, ethnicity, sexuality or something else that makes them different.

But if you think that Islam as an 'ideology' can lead normal people to rape children you need to get your head checked. Rapists and paedophiles abuse children because they are fucked up and disturbed individuals, not because of their religion.

Do you know how many people are involved in these grooming gang cases? Maybe a few hundred at the most. Do you know how many Muslims live in the UK? Well over two and a half million. Your argument is like saying that there were 300 burglaries in Bristol last year and that proves that people from Bristol are all burglars and it's okay to attack them. Seriously, that's how stupid this argument of yours is.

And the most important thing you should take away here is that if you think it's okay to defend hate crimes against Muslims by bringing up grooming gangs and terrorism then you're a fucking bigot and an Islamophobe."
133,ekvikv0,"No, it is not. Is infighting among the communists, the muslim menshevik (CAIR) faction vs the bolsheviks. Muslims have become emboldened by their numbers and the result of islamic terrorism, and want a bigger piece of the pie. See how they run women knowing that a muslim man has less chances of being elected for the time being. Muslim women are 100 percent controlled by their men."
134,egeajh6,"&gt; AIPAC, has long greased the wheels of American politics by bundling millions of dollars for campaign 

Ilhan said that American-Jewish money (Or ""Jew Gold""/""Shekels"" as Ilhan says in private) not Israeli money is bribing politicians to be pro Israel. This is False. J-Street which is anti Israel gives just as much as AIPAC. 

Ilhan receives thousands from PAC's including ones that were unindicted co-conspirators to terrorism (CAIR). There are 50 PAC's that give more then AIPAC. Why does she focus on the Jewish-funded one (not Israel funded)? Lobbying is US legal according to the constitution. You can advocate for the anything as a lobbyist. Just because you lobby FOR Israel does not mean that Israel PAYS for the lobbying. Two countries, South Korea, and Japan are directly lobbying and they spend more then all the pro-Israel lobbies. Besides, Anti-Israel J-street PAYS more to lobby the US government then all other Jewish lobbies combined.

&gt; The two Muslim women are the first-ever supporters of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement 

Ilhan's initial position was that she [supported](https://americanzionism.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/bds_nazi.png) the Nazi style boycotts on our Jewish and Arab brothers in Israel. After that, Ilhan went to a local synagogue and told the Jews she would not support Nazi style boycotts on Israel. Now she is back to supporting Nazi style boycotts. The difference between Ilhan and the far right is that her Nazi style boycotts are supported by her political affiliates in the Democratic Party whereas no Republican supports Nazi style boycotts in Congress. 

Studies show a CLEAR [link](https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/report-finds-clear-link-between-antisemitism-and-hostility-to-israel-1.479329) between Ilhan's Anti-Zionism and antisemitism. Anti-Zionism has done more to undermine Jewish safety than all the ugly tweets, dog whistles, and white nationalist marches combined. It is the predominant justification for violence, murder, and hatred against Jews in Europe and the Middle East. And it’s now infiltrating American politics. Do you tell Black people that bigotry is fake or is it just Jews like me?

The Israeli government has already found [links](https://m.jpost.com/Diaspora/Antisemitism/Minister-Erdan-BDS-groups-have-ties-to-PFLP-Hamas-and-PA-560368/amp) to BDS, Muslim Brotherhood, and Hamas with these anti-zionist Jewish groups. Ilhan supports BDS. This is not a conspiracy.

The BDS Anti-Zionists use comments just like the those old fashioned White nationalists antisemites who used tiki torches to light up Charlottesville march or shoot up the Pittsburgh Synogogue. 

Ilhan [never](https://www.israellycool.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/omar-apology.png) apologized during her tweet.

Ilhan's apology was:

Tactical apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing offers an apology that is rhetorical and strategic—and not necessarily heartfelt
Explanation apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing offers an apology that is merely a gesture that is meant to counter an accusation of wrongdoing. In fact, it may be used to defend the actions of the accused
Formalistic apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing offers an apology after being admonished to do so by an authority figure—who may also be the individual who suffered the wrongdoing

Ilhan believe in Islam which is supports subjugation of women and throwing Gays off roofs. If that's progressive then you are on drugs. She has not denounced this gay killing and she has not denounced the Jew haters like Hamas. If I was associated with the alt-right (I am a Jew so I cant), I would be castigated by the world but If I support an ideology that hates gays then I am okay.

&gt; Though this schism is centered on policy, the Islamophobic subtext is clear and undeniable. 

Anti-Semitic hate crimes are about 3 [times](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2016/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses) more likely then Anti-Muslim hate crimes. Acknowledging that the teachings of Islam are used justify violence and supremacism against Jews is not Islamophobia."
135,e9jin3e,"I mean I totally could, but white Christian men are something like 20% of the population, and Islamic men are something like 0.5% of the population.

Do you think there are 40 times more deaths and injuries from mass shootings than from Islamic terrorism?

Bearing in mind that this is *mass* shootings, because the vast majority of firearm deaths in the US have a black perpetrator. I'm only talking about mass shootings and so are you."
136,e3qcecz,"Well the religion itself tells its followers it's okay to marry 6 year old children, have intercourse with 9 year olds, preaches that women have a 'deficiency of the mind' among many, many more misogynistic comments. A large percentage of Muslim women are either actually forced or socially forced (it's absolutely not free will. Free will implies there's no social pressure) to cover their hair or sometimes faces. Gay people are not accepted in pretty much any Muslim community or mosque. I saw my female classmates (my school was 40% Muslim) be held to completely different standard's to their brothers. The Muslim boys would play with us after school but their sister's weren't allowed. The Muslim boys got sex education but the Muslim girls were not given permission. Several students underwent FGM. 

The religion is not just being criticised for acts of terrorism (which I realise do not represent Muslims as a whole)
There's many issues within Islam and I simply don't like seeing so many women and gay people treated as second class citizens without Muslim communities."
137,e1nydx5,"whats the general feeling amongst everyday tunisian's regarding all of that? tunisia did manage to pass through a law that muslim women are legally allowed to marry non muslims afterall.

are tunisians generally progressive or are they still rather conservative with their beliefs? surely the younger generation are more secular right, they are the only successful arab state to secularize after the arab spring afterall.
my aunt used to be married to a tunisian although it was one of those sugarmummy marriages that's common in poorer countries, the ones were a younger man marries an older woman to take advantage of her money (which he did). they were married for 8 years but he was never allowed to move to the UK as his brother had previously been arrested for terrorism offences in tunisia. eventually my aunts husband divorced her because he felt guilty i think but there was like a 25 year age gap lol"
138,e1ug0p2,"Also, no tears or award wapsi or anything for these innocent people.
I remember I tried really hard to become a ""lefty"" in India because I am extremely liberal so I don't get along with religious people. But I remember one time the government gave passports to hindu people escaping horrors in pakistan and my FB blew up with these people talking about how India shouldn't interfere. Like seriously? India's history is all about welcoming refugees, so now they are hindus we should let them die?

Every single person who supports Congress in India is deluded and has some serious mental issues where they can't even see their own hypocrisy. 
Quite frankly, they remind me of MAGA supporters in USA- their most serious problem with Modi is that he is chai wala (obsessed with class and useless college education like I went to Wharton trump,) they call BJP supporters- bhakts (snowflakes here in usa), they oppose everything BJP government does to prevent pollution and climate change- increasing use of solar, banning plastic, swachh bharat abhiyan. They just whine and whine. It is so frustrating. And they call themselves liberals. 

It is incredibly amusing that I hate 70% of what BJP stands for. But at least they have a plan instead of whining and blaming. With BJP I know if they try to encourage Hindu extremist movements the media will monitor them constantly. With Congress, they literally encouraged terrorism by increasing marginalization of muslims in India. One of the major goal of BJP- Uniform Civil Code and making madrasas join mainstream schools in what they teach should ideally be what these people want. UCC even includes a suggestion to make gay marriage legal for everyone- it is THAT secular. But nope. These people will whine and support polygamy while talking about sad condition of hindu women. Muslim women are also people. They also deserve support from extremism. 

I could rant about this everyday. It is incredibly sad because these people are intelligent and they could be doing so much for the country if they stopped with their obstructionist agendas."
139,dt98gng,"Actually Muslim women are more likely to be unemployed due to the cultural aspects. Entirely uncontroversial. 

Also if he fuels racism. Surely that means you fuel terrorism by allowing such people to come over? He’s affecting a minority. And enabling them. And so are you."
140,dtaez8f,"&gt;Actually Muslim women are more likely to be unemployed due to the cultural aspects

Oh sorry, I didn't realise you spoke pure fact. So the actual scientific study I linked which backs up the notion that it is literally harder for a person with a Muslim-sounding name to get a job means nothing, but the words coming from your mouth should be followed like a doctrine?

&gt;Surely that means you fuel terrorism by allowing such people to come over? 

The terrorism would happen anyway. Of course people think it doesn't matter when it happens in the Middle-East, right? At least if it happens in this country we usually get some evidence to lock a few people up, preventing possible future deaths. That doesn't happen in the middle-east because they don't have the resources to police things that effectively. So overall you could say it's a net good to have them over here. They are slowly exposed to our way of living, we have an incentive to end their wars from our position of power, we help police them effectively, overall it's a net benefit to the world."
141,dtvmlu2,"&gt; What's the difference between developing nukes and actively financing the Taliban and other Jihadist groups like Pakistan have done in Kashmir and Afghanistan whilst they impose Sharia across these regions.

Ask your politicians. I don't recall any sanctions against Pakistan for state-funded terrorism or imposing sharia. Unless you have sources to prove otherwise, your argument that the reasons for sanctions are good enough to impose immigration bans fails right out of the gate.

&gt; Leading, my ass.

Okay, you either don't believe in leading questions, or you think Politico's survey was unbiased. Fine. What am I to take from your lack of commentary on the four other sources which reported that the American public doesn't agree with the administration's travel ban or Muslim ban? Are you going to ignore it because you don't like what they say or will you discredit them all as a conspiracy from biased sources?

&gt; I don't need to cook up a 'narrative', Trump won the election, Clinton didn't. What do I need to help my 'narrative' other than the one cold hard fact that Trump won?

Yes, I can read the news too. In the USA, there's a difference between winning an election and winning the popular vote. So when you said, [**""Let's face it, the vast majority of Europeans don't want Muslim immigration. We know this from polls showing what they think. I'm sure the sentiment is similar in the US, naturally so after voting for a leader who proposed a Muslim ban.""**](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/7uezmx/what_to_do_about_the_muslim_immigrant_communities/dtl1bg1/), when we know that the majority of Americans did not vote for Trump, you have to either accept that the sentiment is not similar to the ""majority of Europeans"" or that you're cherry-picking the cold hard facts which support your narrative.

Thanks to gerrymandering and the electoral college, US citizens might have the equal rights to vote, but the value of their vote is definitely not equal across the country. That's why it's mathematically possible to win the presidential election with just 21% of the popular vote. As unlikely as that is to happen, it does illustrate the problem itself. Just because a particular candidate won the election, does not automatically mean they have a mandate from the public. This was clearly demonstrated by what Trump's administration was (un)able to achieve in the first year.

Your ""narrative"" has shifted from the will of the people (untrue) to the will of the people that matter, and then to the will of an elected president. I can only guess where you'll go next, to find some support for your agenda.

&gt; If English is as ingrained as a second language throughout much of the world like you think it is, why do I see many Muslim immigrants in their ghettoes in London not speaking a word of English.

Why do I see many western adults struggling to read and write at an elementary level when English is their **ONLY** language? Take all of those reasons, the fact that English is probably their 2nd or 3rd language, compound it if they're living in segregated communities (""ghettos"") and the problem doesn't get any better.

&gt; It's well documented that Muslim women, in particular, can't speak English. It's one of the reasons why unemployment in Muslim communities is so low.

It's also well documented that Muslim women are some of the most isolated individuals in any society. Those backward Muslim men-folk aren't going to help them out. The way you're talking about them serves only to isolate them further.

"
142,dug6kd6,"Andy.

I am asking you what **concrete steps** can we take to prevent another Aqsa Parvez?

Your ""solutions"" seem to be some combination of:

* kid gloves - Muslims need to be coddled and hopefully one day they'll get around to not forcing their wives to wear cloth bags and will in fact start cheering for our Olympic curling team and start wearing Crosby 87 jerseys, amirite amirite?
* get people to report abuse, somehow - as if Muslim women are not currently reporting abuse and being ignored by a protective and judicial service that is afraid of being branded racist by getting involved in ""domestic"" or ""cultural"" affairs.
* tolerating intolerance - because nothing shows my virtue better than allowing my culture to be replaced by the one that produced the hellhole country that these people are ironically running from.
* love - because love conquers all, heart heart, hug hug, kiss kiss, big hug, little kiss.

I am asking you for **concrete steps.**

Enough with the obscurantism, rainbows, unicorns and butterflies.

**Concrete steps.**

Also, do you have those 2 drawings done yet? Remember? We were going to celebrate our Canadian diversity by counting how many death threats you'd get.

&gt; Women in Iran are fighting against FORCED wearing of their hijabs. People are fighting.

Andy, why are they fighting against the hijab?

Why the hijab?

Why not, say, open-toed sandals?

What's so important about the hijab?

Could it be that it's more than just a piece of fabric?

Could it be that it stands for something, and is part of something bigger?

Could it be that it is part of a system of control that includes honor killings and bans on women being educated or driving? One that holds that women are ritually unclean when menstruating? One where women should remain silent in places of worship and pray separately? One that wants women to resign positions of authority, stop working and stay home? One where females have become a commodity, a possession? One where the honor of the Muslim family is seen to reside in a woman's chastity and modesty? One where women are to be completely covered and excluded from the outside world? One where women, in effect, have become symbols of men's Islamic commitment?

Maybe that's what these brave Iranian women are fighting for?

But somehow, that same piece of fabric over here in the West means something else. It means freedom of choice. Funny how we can go from a hijab being a cogwheel in the Islamic misogyny machinery to...fashion statement, just by a simple change in geography. Amazing.

You said earlier than forcing a woman not to veil is the same as forcing a woman to veil. And I disagreed. Because life isn't always black and white, in fact it almost never is, especially when it comes to ethics and morality. Two wrongs don't make a right...except when it does. 

If it's wrong to physically confine someone against their will, then it's wrong to physically confine someone against their will who has themselves physically confined someone else against their will. But then why do we imprison kidnappers?

I'll tell you what Iranian women are fighting for. They're fighting to get rid of the same Islamic conservatism that is strangling the life out of their society, the same Islamic conservatism that Western liberal societies are celebrating as ""diversity"" and allowing to gain a stronger and stronger foothold. All in the name of tolerance. That's what they're fighting for.

And while that lone, brave Iranian woman is standing at the side of the road, waving her hijab, risking her life and showing more balls than 90% of the Western liberals, she's probably wondering, ""what the fuck is wrong with you liberals? I thought you'd have my back, instead you're calling me an Islamophobe""

Finally, I'll give you some information on myself - I am non-white, born in a 3rd world country and immigrated to Canada sixteen years ago. I have **first hand** experience being the victim of Islamic terrorism and violence. I have personally witnessed what unchecked Islamic fundamentalism does to a country, unlike the hordes of Starbucks-sipping, skinny-jeans-wearing, liberal armchair philosophers who foam at the mouth for social justice and microaggressions on Twitter when they're not attending gender studies classes. And I've seen time and time again that the foot soldiers of radical Islam are not the jihadists and the ultra-conservative Muslims, but the ""ultra-tolerant"", liberal far-left who gleefully clear the way for them to bore into the core of our beautiful culture and values and make a mockery of all it stands for, using our tolerance against us, using our freedoms against us and using our democracy against us. I am not a conspiracy theorist, I am a realist. In the sixteen years that I've been in Canada, I've seen it slowly change for the worse, just like it did in the country I came from. And if you're being honest and can say you haven't noticed, then you haven't been paying attention. There is no Muslim majority country that is a bastion of free-speech, gay rights, women's rights, minority, equality and democracy. None. Not a single one. I once read a quotation from someone that went like this: *In countries where Muslims are a minority, they are obsessed with minority rights. In countries where Muslims are the majority, there are no minority rights.*

I play hockey with two Muslim guys. I play poker with them several times a year. One of them drinks. They are Canadians first. Muslim second. These are the types of Muslims Canada needs. Muslims who assimilate. Migrants who assimilate. We need to encourage those types of people to come here. And what about the Muslims that are already here who have no interest in assimilating and adopting our values? The answer to that question is complex, I certainly don't have all of the answers, but you'll never get to an answer if you refuse to ask the question in the first place."
143,dp6g7rw,"&gt;You imply that I'm naively tolerant of an ideology that wants to kill me.

Yes you are! Learn from history! Look at what atrocities the Muslim world has perpetrated to any country that does not bow to its wicked religion!

&gt;You pretend that being ""anti-Islam"" will solve the problem of terrorism. 

Great timing that 7 kids were run over by a Muslim today by the way. Today is the perfect opportunity to have this discussion!


Being anti-Islam is the start to tackling terrorism in a strategic manner. The first stage of treatment is accepting there **is** a problem. You still miss the big picture because this isn't about terrorism-- its about the preservation of western culture and Christianity against the rapid growth of Islam. Look at the ethnic cleansing going on of Muslims in Myanmar by Buddhists. They are not killing all Muslims including women and children to stop terrorism. That is just a side effect. Instead, they aim at preserving their culture, their people, and the lives and freedom of their children. Am I correct in that judgement?

&gt;So let's flip it around. As you know, there are many millions of Muslim people who support liberal values consistent with those generally held in our country. You should be actively trying to welcome and make ties with those people!

A minority is friendly and law-abiding only in its minority state. If you are deceived that easy what are your thoughts about all the Nazi's who support liberal values as well? Would you help promote and spread Nazi culture in America? Make them feel at home? Of course not! 

You are following a strategy known as ""appeasement"" that was tried in WWII to prevent the inevitable war by giving in to Germany's demands and turning a blind eye to their atrocities. By turning a bling eye to the degeneracy Islam promotes, you are enabling the growth and becoming tolerant of an intolerable religion. Its a paradox that ends in Muslims winning, and the western world suffering. Germany, Sweden, Italy-- all have tried to appease the Muslim world. It is a beast that is never satisfied until every knee bows and all power is held under its reach.

&gt; It is indefensible on any grounds, let alone ridiculous scare mongering about my wife being sold into slavery.

How do you feel you would be treated in Egypt, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, or Turkey? Between [2005 to 2015, an estimated 900,000 Christians were killed because of their faith. 9 out of 10 of these nations overwhelmingly Muslim.](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/14/christian-persecution-how-many-are-being-killed-where-are-being-killed.html). 

Look at how women, especially non-Muslim women, are treated in Muslim countries. You can try and pretend that would never be so in Europe or American, but you'd be wrong. It says in the Qur'an: 

&gt;“Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband’s) absence what Allah would have them guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) beat them (lightly); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them Means (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High, great (above you all),” (4:34).

&gt;Quran (3:151) - ""Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority"".

&gt;Quran (5:33) - ""The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement""

&gt;“When the sacred months are over slay the idolaters wherever you find them. Arrest them, besiege them, and lie in ambush everywhere for them.” Quran 9:5

etc... etc... there are so many quotes against the non-believer you can't possibly believe in a ""moderate"" version of Islam unless they re-wrote the Qur'an. 
"
144,do1334o,"So you say the methodology has been questioned and in one of those articles they even say it is the most comprehensive poll. Then they bring up unfounded issues that they have with the poll, no evidence just a bunch of what about and what if. They also tried to bring up the parts of the poll where there are good things to try and balance out the bad, which doesnt make the bad points any better. One of the criticisms was that they are a minority so a lot of them are in areas with high muslim populations so their views might be different because of that. That is a good reason for fewer of them to come into the country because they need to let go of the radical ideas that they have in relation to the society they are in. The first couple articles tried to cast doubt on the poll and all theuly did was make the case for limiting immigration from muslim countries stronger.

Next the survey that you just called into question for the methodology that you have the methodology for and that the previous articles referred to as the best study to date and ran with a methodology that is in line with the definition of a good and reliable study with statistically relevant numbers. Dont know why you went through the trouble of getting the first 2 articles that did nothing but try to hint that people are racist for believing the study and try to cast doubt on the study with a bunch of nonsence Hypotheticals.

1. Muslims apparently get less harassment than I do for my religion. I guess atheists dont like being called racists but they are fine harassing people from non muslim religions. (only 17% of the Muslim polled felt that they had been harassed in the last yesr for their religious beliefs)

2. Only 49% of the respondents want to fully intergrate into the society.

3. 47% disagree that a homesexual should be a teacher (christians get lambasted for even thinking about this)

4. 43% thought that muslim women are treated with more respect in muslim countries than in britian (feminism has apparently failed, the countries that tend to have human right abuses are about the same as britian)

5. 31% think it is okay for a british muslim to have more than one wife. This is illegal in britian.

6. 52% think homosexuality should be illegal in britian and of the remaining respondances 22% would not take a yes or no stance. Only 18% agree, what would most people call a group of people like this? Bigoted homophobes maybe? Oh nope, they have the brown armor on they are fine.

7. 56% think that homosexual marriages should be illegal. You dont get numbers like this in the west for staunch catholics and yet those people are painted as the biggest homophobes on the planet.

8. Sharia law 43% oppose it, yay you have a victory. But there are already courts there so the 23% that are for it must have been in power and as we saw above they like their mosques and mosques and the imams like their sharia law.

9. 94% feel they are able to practice their religion freely so it isnt the people in the UK that are being bigoted. And 88% like living in britian, it I'd probably that homosexual thing. But who cares about homosexuals right? Most muslims dont.

10. 24% feel that violence to protect their religion or group is justified verses 7% of the rest of britian.

11. Publishing pictures of Muhammad only 4% of muslims think it is okay. Even more telling is somehow 20% of non muslim British citizens think that it should be banned. How afraid are these people to think that a picture should not be published? 78% of muslims say that the picture of Muhammad should be published.

12. If you thought that someone who is close to you was getting involved with people who 
support terrorism in Syria, who would you talk to? 

Here you have a point but we have this other category. Only 2% of muslims would talk to other (guessing the authorities) and 19% of non-muslims. The whole i would no nothing being at 9% is actually bad only 3% of non muslims would not get involved. The choices were to talk to somebody about it. So still not looking great for the muslims.

You dont have somebody that is against your ideals in the neighborhood, like a theif and then think, well we should get more of the theives in here. Other than the bad parts of their character they are fine. We could extend this to other actions that are antithetical to the native culture. you dont take mass amounts of people with views this different from the native population especially when some of the things that they think are fine are actually illegal. If you think this is a great course of action, take them into your home and you pay for them. 

We have no need to accept people in our society that are not similar to us. Im guessing that you cant even accept a single person into your social circle if they did not align with your values. But, you want to do this to a whole country? That is a incongruent way of thinking, once you can put your money where your mouth is we will talk about throwing open the borders."
145,dl5psts,"Yeah, *based on the teachings of Islam*. Women are inferior in most religions but especially in Islam. Forget terrorism, Muslim women are forbidden from visiting their most holy site, that's reserved for men only. Women can't be catholic priests and that's insanely backwards, but catholic women aren't forbidden from the Vatican, aren't forced to wear clothes and aren't forced to do whatever their husband or father says just cause he has a dick.

"
148,dlvtgze,"&gt; how many ""bad"" apples have you met among Muslims that you know directly?

Several, at least. Putting a smile on your face when you go to the office and being nice isn't enough.  
Reason: it's not just about terrorism. It's about how people treat each on a smaller level as well. When I go out, I always wonder why muslim women are hardly to be seen anywhere, but you can find muslim guys in clubs, cafes, bars, etc. If I see muslim women, their father is there accompanying them, or it's just a group of women with their mothers.  
You can find muslim guys dating outside their religion, but it's extremely rare for a muslim woman to do so, and it would probably be dangerous for her and the guy she would date.  
How come I see people from different religions going to visit each other's religious sites and buildings, and yet the muslims I've met refuse to step into a church or a buddhist temple?  
  
With all the religions there's ""give and take"", compromises are made, *tolerance isn't even needed since you don't have to tolerate things that you don't have a problem with in the first place*. But with islam this seems to be significantly more difficult."
149,djgxsqm,"Where did you generalize muslims?
--------------
The monarchy of saudi arabia would not exist if the people did not want it to, people want the sharia in droves and their system will remain so for who knows how long. (where was this poll taken? We have a president that didnt even win popular vote lol.)

 saudi arabia, aka the only one that matters since they fund every other radical group (Every other radical group? Afganistan, Iraq, libya, lebanon, syria havnt been major hubs of terrorism?)

The issue with muslims even in the west is that statistically a large amount of them want sharia.(What statistic? Study conducted by who??? ""Want sharia"" is supposed to mean approve of sharia guidelines or want sharia enforced in the West?)

why would you be friends with a muslim who would have you stripped of your rights if you were a women? (Are you talking about Saudi arabia or nearly every other muslim country where women can vote, work, and own property?)

 Have you no pity for the muslim women that suffer under sharia, you think they want the law applied to them? (Muslim women are all opposed to sharia and need to be saved?) 








"
150,djzdxy2,"&gt;You know, if we had gone to war with any of the countries that the 9/11 hijackers actually came from, you might have a point...

Jihadists attacked, and we went to war using the attacks as justification. Actions done by jihadists resulted in our going into two wars. 

&gt;what causes these people to be willing to blow themselves up to kill us in the first place? It's not ""radical Islam!""

I do believe you are incorrect. There seems little doubt that terrorism in the case of ISIS is due to radical Islam. The following is from the horse’s mouth—ISIS’s Dabiq magazine, available online. The following is from volume 15.

Beginning of quote:
“As such, it becomes important for us to clarify to the West in unequivocal terms – yet again – why we hate you and why we fight you.”

1. “We hate you, first and foremost, because you are disbelievers”
2. “We hate you because your secular, liberal societies permit the very things that Allah has prohibited while banning many of the things He has permitted”
3. “In the case of the atheist fringe, we hate you and wage war against you because you disbelieve in the existence of your Lord and Creator.” 
4. “We hate you for your crimes against Islam and wage war against you to punish you for your transgressions against our religion.” 
5. “We hate you for your crimes against the Muslims”
6. “We hate you for invading our lands and fight you to repel you and drive you out. “

“What’s important to understand here is that although some might argue that your foreign policies are the extent of what drives our hatred, this particular reason for hating you is secondary” (End of quote)

How do you explain that quote if radical Islam is not the reason they are willing to blow themselves up while killing us?

&gt;From my own experience, yes. It's cultural, not ""extremist.""

I never claimed hijabs were ""extremist"". I said that are more likely to be worn by conservative muslims. I find it hard to believe that is a disputable point. Conservative muslim women are going to be wearing hijabs at least, and in many cases niqabs and burkhas, depending on the country they are in.

&gt;you are trying to distinguish between ""good Muslims"" and ""bad Muslims"" on superficial attributes, like whether or not the women wear hijabs.

I do not paint anyone who wears a hijab as a ""bad Muslim"". I only claim that an increased number of hijabis are one factor (along with the other three factors I mentioned a couple comments ago) that supports the claim that the numbers of conservative Muslims in America are increasing. 

&gt;Number of events.

In American, Christians are about 70% of the population, and Muslims are about 1% of the population. If Christians and Muslims are radicalized at the same rates, then you'd expect there to be 70 times as many events due to Christian terrorism than events of Muslim terrorism. If the number of christian terrorism events is less than 70 times the number of muslim terrorism events, then it is obviously so that there is a higher likelihood that a muslim will carry out an event than a Christian. (I am not a Christian BTW. Christianity sucks big time).

153,diinmf5,"Islam and Rape: Joined at the Hip


http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/01/islam_and_rape_joined_at_the_hip.html


Pamphlets being issued in Germany to Muslim male refugees that they are not to grope or fondle European women reveal the rank stupidity, ignorance, and sheer indifference of European leaders as they continue down a suicidal trajectory.


Of course these men were going to engage in rape jihad, since sexual abuse is ingrained in their religion and culture. As psychologist Nicolai Sennels explains, ""Mohammed, the prime example for Muslims, married Aisha when she was six and had intercourse with her when she was nine. Besides, according to the Quran (4:24), Muslims are allowed to have sex with female slaves[.]"" In addition, ""uncovered women are in many Muslim cultures seen as a kind of prostitute, and if a man is aroused by such a female, then – partly due to the corrupted logic of responsibility within Muslim psychology – the female is blamed for being raped (and will therefore often face execution).""


In 2010, Andrew C. McCarthy, in his book entitled The Grand Jihad, described rape by Muslim immigrants as the ""unspoken epidemic of Western Europe."" Six years later, it continues to expand and sweep across the continent. Ingrid Carlqvist documents how Sweden is now the rape capital of the West, and when ""Michael Hess, a local politician from [the] Sweden Democrat Party, tried to warn his nation that 'it is deeply rooted in Islam's culture to rape and brutalize women who refuse to comply with Islamic teachings' he was charged with 'denigration of ethnic groups'"" – a crime in Sweden.


According to Islamic clerics, a woman who fails to wear a headscarf is asking to be raped. Consequently, in the eyes of Muslim men, Western women are seen as ""promiscuous, loose, and willing,"" and since no one in the Islamic community refutes this, they engage in the violence and abuse of power that rape represents. In Australia, Lebanese gangs threaten policemen's wives and girlfriends with rape. In 2006, the mufti of Australia, Sheikh Taj al-Din al Hilali, maintained that ""women who do not veil themselves, and allow themselves to be 'uncovered meat,' are at fault if they are raped.""
In Rotherham, England, some 1,400 British children as young as 11 were plied with drugs before being passed around and sexually abused by Muslims. As shocking as this was, it is the fifth sex abuse ring led by Muslims according to Raymond Ibrahim, who has been unremitting in his revelation of crimes committed in the name of Islam.


According to Abigail R. Esman, since 2006 the Dutch have described how second-generation Moroccan youths grope Dutch women and call them sluts. Jamie Glazov describes the horrible scar that myriad women now bear. Known as ""smiley,"" whereby ""one side of the face is cut up from mouth to ear, it is a war mark left by Muslim rapists as a warning to other women who don't veil themselves."" Thus, Muslim and now even non-Muslim women feel the pressure to veil themselves. And female European leaders in perfect synchronized dhimmitude stance tell women to ""adopt a code of conduct"" to discourage men from committing sexual assault.


Jihadis are importing girls from Tunisia to satisfy their sexual needs. Sudan has long used rape against Christians and animists as well as against those Muslims in Darfur who were judged to be ""insufficiently Islamic."" In Nigeria, Boko Haram seized 300 schoolgirls in order to sell them on the open market. In Pakistan, the police do nothing as Hindu and Christian children as young as 7 years old are gang-raped and sold as prostitutes or slaves to wealthy Muslim families. From 2011 through 2014, approximately 550 Egyptian Coptic Christian girls were abducted and sexually abused by Muslim men.


The recent revelation of packs of men assaulting women during New Year's celebrations in Cologne is but one of the barbaric behaviors permitted by the Koran whereby abusing infidel girls and women is a right, since they are spoils of war. Repeatedly, Muslim clerics maintain the legality of sex slavery. Sex slaves are not at all forbidden because their existence means that Muslim men will not have to ""engage in forbidden sexual relations."" Thus, it is perfectly fine to rape and enslave non-Muslims since they are little more than ""chattels or possessions over whom [Muslims] have absolute authority."" And white women are to be treated with ""particular contempt.""


The Koran mandates the second-class status of women. Consequently, Muslim women have been forced to marry and have sex with men against their will. Should women violate any of the misogynist sharia laws, death will ensue. In 2013, an astonishing 91 percent of the upwards of 20,000 honor killings each year were committed by Muslims. Forty-three percent of women in Turkey and 82% in Morocco are victims of sexual and physical abuse. If this is how Muslim women are treated, certainly non-Muslim women can expect far worse.


The ISIS magazine named ""Dabiq"" justifies the enslavement and rape of non-Muslim women because such acts follow Islamic tradition. Thus, Yazidi women and children are now sold by the Islamic state soldiers. Anyone who would argue against such behavior faces decapitation. Moreover, ""gang rape is officially sanctioned as a legitimate form of keeping women marginalized and 'in their place.'"" In fact, an ISIS fatwa listing15 rules for ""using, selling, and sharing female slaves"" was intercepted by Special Operations Forces in January of 2015.


The distortion of healthy sexual and loving relationships that is so endemic in Muslim culture has resulted in the horrific scenes repeatedly played out across the world. Glazov emphasizes that ""throughout the Islamic Middle East, men and women are taught to be vehemently opposed to pleasure, especially of the sexual variety. Men are raised not only forbidden to touch women, but to even look at them. Sex before marriage is not just a sin – but a criminal offence. It is punishable by a severe beating at best, and an execution at worst.""


Concerning suicide bombers, Dr. Tawfik Hamid explains that much of the motivation to join the jihadist cause is driven primarily by Muslim men's ""extreme sexual frustration."" The promise of 72 virgins waiting in heaven for a martyr of Islam is appealing to Muslim men, for whom sex is, to a large extent, unattainable. Child marriage, however, is sanctioned in Muslim countries, and pederasty is widespread.

I agree with the french law because I care about women, not because I hate Muslims *you fucking sexist*. Notice I didn’t actually call you one *until now*. You people love to put words in mouths.

Prove it. Indoctrination isn't an argument. Everyone is indoctrinated in some form.

&gt;I agree with the french law because I care about women,

No you don't. You only care about your cultural imperialism. The second Muslim women start walking around in crop tops and booty shorts, that's when your ""care"" ends.

&gt;If you think most Muslim women are happy with their lot then you are delusional. How dare you speak for these people and imply that they are in agreement with their own oppression.

It's not your place to tell Muslim women if they are oppressed or not and we will never allow you to dictate the lives of our mothers, daughters and wives. Fuck your militant anti theism."
159,fyqfrz8,"There's already a Pakistan man and Hindu woman who got married in Dubai and came to Pakistan. She basically said the government didn't give a crap. Think the YouTube channel was called Hashim and Manisha. 

To be honest Muslim women marrying non-Muslims is not an acceptable thing in our society and for good reason and most of us would not tolerate it (including me). I'm opposed to it because the husband will be disrespecting the wife for life as her religion clearly says he should convert over. If he can't respect her religion saying this they should not get married. To my recollection Hinduism doesn't say such a thing so it's okay to ask Hindu girls (or guys) to convert over to Islam. 

I'm opposed to interfaith marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim men because almost 100% of them end up in disaster anyway so they are a threat to our women. Muslim women are very loyal but their non-Muslim husbands/partners are often not. Case in point is Sannah Khan and that Christian guy in India. He cheated on her. Another is a girl called Janice Griffiths. She is pornstar from the US. She comes from a Hindu father and a Muslim mother. Their entire family broke apart because her father allowed her to whore herself. She has a Turkish Muslim boyfriend now (who is the nephew of Cenk Ugyur the guy who runs The Young Turks News network on YouTube). 

I could you give you an endless amount of stories where Muslim women who married non-Muslim men end up in similar disasters. There's a reason why Allah said Muslims should only marry Muslims because we know what our values are and we are not as promiscuous as non-Muslims are. Lastly, a word to the girls of sub: if you're gonna marry non-Muslims, keep a level head, and be brave and ask them to convert. If they don't want to, it means they're not taking the relationship with you seriously. If they truly love you they will convert. Same to the guys."
160,ftrp6ue,"A group of Hindu men (probably 50 million Hindu men) need to come together and rescue Hindu women who are kidnapped and raped by Muslim men.

This is the only way how the menace of Love Jihad can be solved.

This has to be a Pan-India effort.

The Muslim men want to target Kaffir women (womb jihad) and increase the number of Muslim births by targeting Hindu women. It is sick and disgusting.

Statistical game theory shows that Islam spreads through Love Jihad, because Muslim men invade Non-Muslim lands and convert/rape/abduct/impregnate/marry Non-Muslim women to spread Islam.

At the same time, Muslim women are not allowed to marry Non-Muslim men.

This is how Islam keeps on growing and growing.

If they target our women, what would happen if we targeted their women? Wouldn't they get angry?

Shouldn't Rapist Love Jihadis be punished? What would that punishment be? My blood boils when I hear cases of Love Jihad from time to time.

Do you think a Hindu man could marry a Muslim woman in one of the Middle Eastern countries? Nope.

**Then, the reverse should be banned in India, completely. Love Jihad should be a punishable offense. It's high time that the Hindu community agitates for a law which criminalizes Love Jihad.**

Remember, that the ""Peacefuls"" will never play by the rules. They are hell bent on conquering India (and the entire world), and will do whatever it takes to accomplish their mission, whether it is population jihad or love jihad.

Remember the Pakistani Muslim grooming gangs who are raping White British women in the UK?

Take a look at what is happening in Mewat, Haryana (80% Muslim district). The Meo Muslims are kidnapping and raping Hindu Dalit women, forcing them to convert to Islam. Meanwhile, the police force has not been able to punish the Jihadis. Mewat has become a mini-Pakistan.

Assamese Hindu women are kidnapped, raped, and abducted in Assam by hordes of illegal Bangladeshi Muslim infiltrators.

**Love Jihad poses a threat to Hinduism and to the Hindu people, period.**

This is exactly how Muslims conquered Iran, which was Zoroastrian at that time. This is exactly how Muslims conquered Pakistan, which was Hindu at that time."
161,furo0j1,"1.

Whereas today Pakistan is the only Muslim Country with Nuclear Capability, whereas there are 8 Non Muslims Countries United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Israel and North Korea. 8 vs 1 Muslims don't have control over Non Muslims anymore. 

2. In Arab culture Man were to spend a lot of time with their children. They would teach them How to use sword, how to ride horse, how to trade in country and outside meaning just as a child turned 7,8 he got attached very personally with his Father thus the influence was very strong, also in Arab, pre Islam and after Islam, Man had Superiority over Woman,  thus he could forcefully take the child away if he would feel the threat that Non Muslim Wife was influencing him the wrong way. Also because Men had Superiority they were able to force the wife to not preach christianity or Judaism to their child. 

3. In today's world Christianity and Judaism has changed, people of Book in past were different and today are Different. In past Christians and Jews WOMEN believed that Man has Superiority over Woman BUT IN TODAY'S ERA THEY BELIEVE MEN AND WOMEN ARE EQUAL.  There are other ways as well in which people of book have changed. Zionist movements have started whereas God hasn't allowed Jews to have their own land as stated in Torah. If they could corrupt God's order and betray him, how can they not betray Their Husband and influence their Child? 
 
4. Are Muslim Women in shortage? There are sisters of our UMMAH who are 30+ Years Old and we are busy thinking about and  marrying Non Muslims, Shame! 

5. Also most chances of a Muslim Man marrying Non Muslim Women are in Non Muslim Countries where Women are clearly  Given more rights in terms of influencing their child. Thus even if Man demands justice he isn't given and the child falls in Judaism or Christianity. 

Thus Marriage of Muslim Man to Non Muslim Women is not allowed in today's era. If a Man finds a Women from people of books who agrees that Man has Superiority over Women in clear terms and words and that future child will be Muslim and the couple are in a Country where Shariah Law is implemented so that Man's rights are safeguarded then it's allowed. These all conditions should be presented in court and woman should agree to it. But you wont find this scenario even today's Muslim Women don't agree to Superiority of Muslim Men let alone people of the Book. 
Summary : It is allowed to marry women from People of Book but there are conditions and as in today's era these conditions cannot be met so it is not allowed nor possible.  End Quote.

163,fsohroj,"Dude you're such a bigot. So this is what you do eh? Spread this hatred. Disgusting. Conveniently skips the part about In India, there's a custom that muslim women are NEVER allowed to enter mosques? How about that eh? Why are you so bothered about Temples &amp; Not mosques where there's a permanent ban on women? Who are hidden under garbage bin like veils called burqas &amp; have to hide their face perpetually? You're stupidity is mind numbing. There's no ""checking"" on periods. Women go to temples as they please. And you've made up this food thing. Thanks for reaffirming my distrust of the muslims. Screenshots your ""India"" misinformation &amp; circulated. What a ""muslim"" does online. You're so full of jealousy aren't you? You bigoted ass can't tolerate Hindus &amp; that's why all you do is sit on your useless ass all day play useless video games &amp; spread misinformation about Hindus. Thanks for opening my eyes about muslims. The biggest mall in my town is owned by muslims, all the grocery stores are owned by muslims. And in the past few months we Hindus whom you hate so much made sure we took our businesses there. Purchased good from there. Thanks for enlightening me &amp; now I know why most people say never trust a Muslim, always a backstabber, always a beggar of rights when in minority, always an oppressor when in majority. Circulated your hateful messages. My community will never be taking our business to any muslim store from here on. There was one muslims Grocer who literally had no customer except me &amp; 2 other Hindus today. Thank you for showing your colors. We won't be doing business with him no more. Seen how you literally sit your ass down to purposefully spread hateful misinformation on Hindus because you're so full of hatred/jealousy. Because Hindus work hard &amp; have a good reputation, couldn't stand that cause Islam has wreaked havoc on the world &amp; your own ppl brought that religion a bad name. So you're taking it out on other non-abrahamic religions/ethnic groups. All you'll ever be is an incel/bigot who'll spend all your life playing useless video games &amp; misinformation online. While the hindus who work haard in the real world treating covid patients, in the army, in the service sector, will progress cause they don't waste their time spreading misinformation like you online. So this is why Americans/Europeans/British hate muslims so much. Cause you reall cannot be trusted. Hope when you're taking your last breaths you remember that you wasted your life being a bigot spewing hate against Hinduism online, that's all you did, nothing else. You could've spent that time being productive, improving your religion, doing good deeds but you decided to bring down anorher ethnic group just so your doesn't look so bad. You're a  vile person &amp; I'll tell you about the most important aspect of Hinduism that even Westerners keep repeating everywhere &amp; that even reddit has adopted  , it's called KARMA. Yes Karma is bitch &amp; it'll bite you in the ass. Hinduism allows for Atheism. Because hinduism belives in the universal forces. Brahma is not a god, he's a deity, the universe. 
Do you know the people who have studied the Bhagavad Gita? World's greatest poets, scientists, astronauts, physicists, musicians, actors. From TS Eliot, Annie Besant, Henry David Thoreau, Oppenheimer, Philip glass, George Harrison, Julia Roberts, Madonna, Russel Brand, Gerard Butler, Hugh Jackman , Robert Downey Jr who are followers of Hinduism/Iskon/Krishna. Bhagavad Gita/Hindu scriptures/Vedas/Upanishads are the only scripture studied by Scientists. Because they were based on studies/research/science/discussion/debates. 
It's India's history. Where discussion &amp; debates have been a part of Hinduism. And there's no concept of Hell, there's rebirth, reincarnation, life cycles, Karma, enlightenment, knowledge, science, universe, worshiping every living thing with respect even animals. 
The way you like to insult the people who don't harm animals for food are 100 times better than you'll ever be because they worship animals instead of killing them because they keep the life forces going , they are a part of this environment.
Unlike Abrahamic religions where questioning is punishable with the threat of Hell. 
Hinduism is based on constant questioning, where Atheism is encouraged. Hindus worship nature &amp; not some paedophile who threatens you will hellfire if you don't follow ""commands"" or is a ""self proclaimed prophet"" who's come to ""save humanity"" for ""sins"" they haven't committed yet cause they weren't even born.
And therein lies your jealousy don't it? Because the only people who study the Quran are people like  David wood who busts the myth or Zakir naik who radicalises young muslims. The only people who study the Quran are those looking for answers about the thinking of Jihad, ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Jaish-E-Mohammed mindsets. 
The only people studying the Quran in university reasearch are those looking to de-radicalise extremists. 
And this is where your jealousy/hatred stems from. 
And if you this all you do online every other day in your life, it will be counter productive because Karma will come to you. The negative energy you put in the life forces of the universe comes back to you. And doesn't touch those people doing good work. They will thrive, you will just remain an online incel. 
That's all you'll have accomplished in life, while they're out there saving lives, being productive, making progress in the scientific field, service sectors..
While muslims waste their time madrasas believing their time on earth is temporary &amp; real life starts in ""Jannat/Heaven"" where they'll get 72 virgins &amp; don't contribute to society.
If you're gonna be an online incel, go be one at r/ex-muslims. Go help them &amp; see what they're going through, escaping countries, running away from their familes. Don't worry about Hindus who are living freely in their familes without fear of any ""Hell"" to keep them tied to their religion, who are free to abuse their deities in comedy clubs &amp; not get killed for it, who are free &amp; openly living as aetheists.
Think why there's barely anything called ""Ex-Hindus"" cause there's literally nothing tying them down, they're free thinkers.
And think about why muslims live in hiding &amp; there's a global ex-muslim organization needed to protect them..
Work on cleansing your own clan instead of spewing hate against others.
Because there's real world Karma points &amp; yours are all in the negative for what you are doing. An incel/a bot. Accomplished nothing but hate towards Hinduism cause your jealousy stems from not being able to digest the hatred the world has for Islam. 

There's more dignity in being an ex-muslim helping other ex-muslims who didn't have a choice in being born into that abhorrent religion than spreading hate towards Hinduism which is the oldest dharma - way of life on Earth, precedes Islam by thousands of years.  Islam, a religion spread by the sword/hatred/fear. Which is exactly what you are doing, as you are a product of it. Trying to score point for Islam by speaking against Hinduism. But Hinduism/Buddhism/Jainsim/Sikhism/East Asian philosophies will thrive &amp; go on. Because peaceful people will always willingly come looking for it.

It's better you accept your ethnicity, you're ancestors were probably killed/tortured to accept Islam. Go watch Joe Rohan's podcast with Russell Brand. Or listen to Beatles albums influenced by Hinduism. Educate yourself to reduce the hate/jealously in your heart , Karma piles on."

166,fo72q79,"Hey intriquingexistance— I think this is an important issue that needs addressing so thanks for starting a conversation on it. While I think there’s a lot of validity to what you’re saying (and yes, this is a topic that’s hushed up all too often in the name of being politically correct), I’m concerned about the conclusions you’re drawing: namely, that Islam should be treated as a monolithic ideological threat to progressive values. (And there is no excusing the horrifying acts done within institutionally patriarchal frameworks in the name of Islam, as you’ve listed above. So by no means do I intend any of this to be apologetics for those things.)

As a Muslim, I think you’re right that this is a very sensitive and uncomfortable thing for a lot of people, especially white Western progressives who don’t want to cross the line into bigotry. I think this is a really deep topic that needs a lot more justice than this paragraph I’m throwing at it, but I do think it’s tricky to navigate this landscape of intertwined issues of race, sex, colonialism, imperialism, and so on. And so there are a few layers and factors to consider here.

1) We don’t want to encourage colonialism. For centuries and through the present day, colonial Europeans encountered people of different backgrounds and immediately denounced what they interpreted as barbarism. Even if what they saw was wrong from a human rights perspective, does anyone want a colonizer to tell them what to do? Despite the act of sati in India being pretty horrible from any perspective, it began to carry with it an anti-colonial flavor, almost just to stick it to the British. After all, once someone’s adopted a colonizing viewpoint, they’ve decided that any progress will be a one-sided thing. Instead of beginning a dialogue in which we solve a problem together, we’re just going to tell someone what’s best for them. And we’ve seen time and again in history that once you rob a people of their right to self-rule, you can give yourself permission to commit all sorts of horrifying colonial atrocities.

You’re an exmuslim person of color, so this is well within your domain to endeavor for change because you have the necessary insight, experience, and heritage to engage genuinely with our communities. But some of what you’re proposing— like getting over a fear of being disrespectful— is easy fuel for hateful fires. There are plenty of people on Reddit happy to find a reason to lump all Muslims as problematic, and this sort of rhetoric gives them permission in their heads to preach messages of hate. This doesn’t mean that well-meaning progressives have to sit on their hands, though. As with anything else in intersectional politics, non-Muslims have a big role to play as allies to people like you. 

2) Islam isn’t monolithic. Yes, religions like Islam carry a lot of baggage, but then, who’s carrying that baggage in what countries and which communities? Which figureheads or sects are we talking about? I know that you didn’t want to go down the rabbit hole because that sort of hair-splitting is often a tactic to distract from bigger issues. But from a practical perspective, how can we stop child marriages if we don’t get specific? If I argue that child marriages are an “Islamic” problem, who would I even be arguing with? Even if I ‘won’ this argument, what would that change? If we focus on a specific community, case, and context, it’s easier to then tease out the factors— Islamic readings included— on why child marriage is wrong, and of course, move from there to look for actions that can address the problem. Moreover, there are 1.5 billion Muslims in the world, and many among us— and scholars even— that are mobilizing towards making genuine progress in our communities and faith tradition, with many of them fighting against inequalities and abuses. Blanket statements about Islam as a whole implies that all of us are acceptable collateral damage. 

When you consider the sudden right turn Muslim politics took in the last century or so, with Wahabbist ideologies and their ilk skyrocketing in their influence, I think it paints a much more flexible picture of what Islam could be, and is, for many people outside of the hyperconsrevative bubble. Amina Wadud, Kecia Ali, Reza Aslan, are all great readings for exploring a lush sea of alternative ways of approaching our faith. It is a tragedy, I think, that this idea that Islam is a monolithic, rigid, and unyielding ideology isn’t just an outside perspective, but an internalized belief for many Muslims. And that doesn’t do us any favors. 

3) As for figureheads, no one’s ever going to be 100% satisfactory for everyone. I’m not sure if you’re referring to Linda Sarsour, Dalia Mogahed, Ilhan Omar, or whomever else, when you argue about people who sanitize oppression and homophobia, given platforms under the guise of intersectional feminism. Again, without being specific, this sort of rhetoric can become easy fuel for ideologies of hate. Even if you don’t like certain people, I think it’s important to engage critically and meaningfully before we write them off. Like, yes, some hijabis glorify the hijab as a tool of empowerment, and yes, a lot of Muslim women are forced to wear it. These things both exist together. One’s empowerment should never be a way to justify another’s oppression, but then again, I don’t think Sarsour or Omar, or any of the other aforementioned names would ever sanctify oppression to begin with. And if these figureheads do have faults, as all humans do, then we engage with those faults. 

\--

So I agree with you that we need to really critically evaluate and make progress on certain ideological frameworks that lock people into contributing to oppressive acts—but that we need to engage without using rhetoric that can trigger colonial, unidirectional action, or fan any flames in these volatile times; but rather open more doors for allies. Thanks for your courage and effort in bringing this up."
167,fkrci62,"&gt; Listen. I don't know what point you're trying to bring, 

I can tell. My point is that muslim women are coerced(implied threat of psychologica, social, and physical force) into wearing masks and robes.

&gt;but I don't care

Then why would I care if you care?

&gt;If you're that persistent then just go argue somewhere else

Why?

&gt;I don't wanna discuss this.

Ok, then don't"
168,fm9z2km,"&gt; Islam is not an ethnicity. Perhaps what you mean to say is that you like Arabs?

Arabs and Desis, yes. Vast majority of Muslims are Asians, but no one talks about them, so we can safely ignore them when we talk about Muslim women. Brown Muslim women are want I want.

&gt;It's similar to the other Abrahamic religions. 

Sam Harris disagrees. Islam is the only religion that poses a threat to the culture of narcissism"
169,fn0ty6n,".... It's more of a threat because it's far more frequent, organised, funded and has killed far more people.... There are states backing islamic terror, there aren't states backing incel virigins to commit atrocities with their uncles ar15.   Young islamic men are far more likely to come from backgrounds that make them easier to recruit, as in they've been victims of wars etc

But sure pointing this out means i just dont like brown people. Which btw is incredibly racist of YOU many Muslims are white, dagestan &amp; chechnya for example and many more are asian, Indonesia."
170,fk0ug9r,"Yeah if Christians were allowing marital rape, I'd tell them how to practice their religion and not do it lmao

&gt;Heard of the protestant group the KKK?

Not, the KKK hasn't been a thing for 50 years, and at its peak was not even comparable to the sheer size of Muslim fundamentalists

&gt;It's undemocratic to hate a religion based on people wanting to practice their religion so long as it hurts no one else

It's hurts the victim of it that are punished under a system not approved and voted by the entire population. Muslim women are citizens of their western country first, and as long as they are, they shall be judged by the countries democratically elected juridical system. Communities are a scourge and a threat to secularism. What do you think of circumcision? Should Jews be allowed to circumsize their children?"
171,fbbh6dt,Exactly.. Muslim women are not a threat to anybody so there was no reason for that shit.
172,fbhr9uv,"Difference is nuns aren't required to wear their habits under threat of severe punishment like Muslim women are often for not wearing a hijab (worst a nun might get for being ""out of uniform"" is a dressing down by her religious superior""). 

In many Muslim countries women are forced to wear the hijab BY LAW and are threatened with arrest and punishment if they dont, and even if they're not legally required to their male relatives might beat the crap out of them or just straight up murder them for it."
173,fd9qt86,"A lot of this is wrong. Some reasons IMO 

Muslims seem to get really angry if they see a non Muslim man with a Muslim woman, there will be always a threat of violence against such a couple, and not just from the family of the woman but any random person on the street. I guess it's somehow deeply offensive as per their religion, and something they want to stop at all costs. I don't know enough about Islam to comment on the reasons. 
Hindus on the other hand are nowhere near as intolerant of such an interreligious situation, for multiple reasons.

For the above reason Non Muslim men avoid dating Muslim women and Non Muslim women are generally more open to talk to anyone regardless of religion and naturally relationships can develop. 

Converting non Muslims seems to be an imperative for Muslims and part of their religion so marrying a non Muslim and converting them to Islam can be seen as a goal of life. Also given polygamy and the status of women, maybe marrying someone is not such a big once in a lifetime deal anyway."
174,f56g8lk,"&gt;  Liberal government clarifies in the legal code that official state business must be conducted with the face visible for security purposes.

The problem is that Muslim women wearing face coverings do not pose a security threat. In otherwords, the law is based on false pretenses that arise out of  xenophobia, not a real security threat.

Rising levels of Islamophobia in the Quebec media do pose a security threat, though,  as the Alexandre Bissonette shootings show. He was motivated by the White-nationalist political idea that Muslims pose an existential threat to Quebec culture, an idea spread intensely  from Quebec's nationalist media, especially in the Quebec City region. In otherwords, the Liberals were responding to growing nationalist hysteria about Muslim women in Quebec, not any real security threat from religious minorities.  

My problem with the law is that it gives to much power to politicians, bureaucrats, and the police to determine what a woman wears. If a Muslim woman is comfortable wearing a face covering, and a white, francophone  male like Francois Legault, Phillipe Couillard, or a bureaucrat in Quebec City  is uncomfortable with it, the white francophone male has the power to use the force of the state to coerce the woman into dressing the way he likes. The Muslim woman is helpless in the face of the law. It violates the rights of Muslim women in the most funademantal way without providing anymore security. If you are going to violate women rights in this way, you need a much better reason than the fact that it makes white francophones uncomfortable.   

The natural result of this hysteria came in France, where they have laws and a political climate  that result in armed police officers forcing Muslim women  to strip to her underwear on a public beach because that's what the majority of white francophones do in France. The collective uses the State to force its will on the individual and minorities. With the CAQ use of the notwithstanding clause, there is nothing to stop officers from ordering Muslim women to strip if they are deemed a security threat by what they wear. The Charter does not apply to this law. This law is the Padlock Law in Duplessis time; there are no protections for Muslim women because of this law.

  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/french-police-make-woman-remove-burkini-on-nice-beach

Given that the SQ in Quebec is known for sexually assaulting minority women systematiically, this is a very unwise law. 

&gt;  Legault's party is a coalition party that includes liberals

Small-l liberals do not support the suspension of the Charter of Rights, which is what the CAQ did when it invoked the notwithstanding clause to pass this law. They are nationalist, not liberals. They believe in the primacy of collective rights, not individual rights. If the collectie believes that Muslim women are a security threat, nationalists like the CAQ and the Front Nationalists believe that trumps individual rights."
175,f5ff0v3,"&gt; it's very difficult to determine whether someone is covering themself out of free will or due to, for example, social pressure

I would argue the same about women who wear very revealing clothes. Are they doing it because they genuinely like showing off their bodies or is it because they feel pressured by society to be ""attractive""? 

Now yes, there are cases where Muslim women are literally forced by their husbands or families to wear the hijab under threat of force. But I would say for the majority of them, they have been raised with it their entire lives and are now conditioned to it, and that is just a matter of cultural values, not ""force"". It's no different than a woman who is raised wearing tight pants and hence doesn't feel comfortable wearing dresses. I'm sure plenty of us have heard a Muslim girl say ""I feel naked without my hijab"" so for radical feminists and liberals to push legislation that bans the headscarf it's extremely hypocritical."
176,f5hpk2m,I agree with you that a woman shouldn't be compelled by threat of force to wear a headscarf. I just don't agree with your assumption that most Muslim women are in that situation. You really have no grounds to assume that and hence you are contradictory in saying that you disagree with the hijab.

178,ev76ms7,"&gt; This is of course backed up by data right? 

What data would you accept, precisely? 

There is hard data showing the rate of domestic violence is absolutely no higher among muslim families than christian, atheist, or any other ethnic group. So if they're being ""coerced"" it isn't any kind of actual abuse or threat. 

Which leaves either believing that even the mildest kind of social norm is ""coercion"" in which case every single social norm is abusive and wrong, or else you're left believing that muslim women are uniquely brainwashed and incapable of choosing for themselves, which is bigoted and misogynistic."
179,evh6ckp,"I only said trans is /gender dysphoria is mental illness because Contrapoints and Blair White and some people iImet here said it was. They were all trans. I would never say its a mental illness if they didn’t! So I’m sorry if that seemed offensive. Being trans is having gender dysphoria which is a mental illness. You cant be trans without gender dysphoria.

I’m saying I am a woman because I am able to give child birth, I experience menstruation and I am, in comparison to a male body, weaker in general. I also have experienced serious inequality in the past and have been oppressed by men. I have a vagina, and I have breasts. So when I say woman, I solely mean: recognize my biological differences to the male or intersex body and my past as women(all women).

Yeah people are saying “thats not what I want” and inventing labels. I understand that and see it as a vague outcome of being subjected to ridiculous gender roles. But is identifying as countless potential identities the best solution? That's all I’m asking. Because to say you are x gender is not that different from saying you don’t identify with a gender. So to choose one over the other, to CHOOSE gender, accepts the very existence of gender and how humans are bound to be put in boxes. 

It encourages the very system its saying its standing outside of. Its encouraging even more stereotypes, as if male-female ‘cis’ were not enough. Its also being disrespectful to the women’s issues, because suddenly with verbal identification you are not a part of the group anymore. its like saying “I hate you, we don’t get along, bye!’ A very individualistic approach.Or a bit worse, you are. You can suddenly be women and speak for women who have felt the real damage of gender roles since birth. I think the patriarchal system is seeing some of the gender identifications as a threat to women and are okay with it because why not? Women are not important, never have been. Thats why we have to fight against it. Its so much efficient to say no to gender altogether and keep our safety. You could try to deconstruct the roles you’re told you’re bound to play instead of trying to be identified as an ‘other’. 

‘cis’ victims of collective grooming are considered liberated and, women in islam are told they are empowered because they say so… Things arent that easy. I really don’t think gender identity is helping women because they’re advocating for this idea: cis females are less than appealing, they’re so girly and privileged, and you are not that, so you will from now on be called non-binary. individual approach… Its not dealing with the real issue. Women are still being exploited and claiming it to be empowerment, muslim women are still oppressed in Saudi Arabia but if its by choice its ‘empowerment’… Cis women are the Miley Cyruses and are grooming by ‘choice’. No choices can exist in a bubble without outside influences. Its similar to all this. The notion of acceptance is making the individual feel better, and yeah that's important. But it is short term. The real problem is roles, not accepting roles or creating more roles. The alternative is more difficult and uncomfortable for the present time.

I will try, but the only ones I found were stating what the article I sent you argued against. So I'll try to find one that responds to the article's points."
180,erzlah7,Muslim women are far more likely to be killed/disowned/raped/beaten/punished when not wearing such clothing in a conservative family/community.  Much of that is not an explicit threat but through a culture of blaming women if they don't dress a certain way.  It is not as simple as being a choice or not.
181,es9l0ej,"&gt;It is simplistic and naive to assume that most women wearing burkinis (or hijab more generally) do so because they are being forced to. I would like to see some statistics on this, but my gut feeling is that the vast majority of them would defend it as their own choice. They would feel genuinely uncomfortable showing too much skin to strangers. You might call it cultural conditioning, and I wouldn't disagree, but the fact remains that the government is trampling upon these women's right to dress as they wish, for no good reason. 

Your gut feeling is based on Islamic PR. You won't hear much from the women who don't want to wear it and are being pressured into it because their husbands and community don't allow them to speak, whereas the women who are doing it ""freely"" are encouraged to say so. That alone should render that argument invalid. 

&gt;That is the moral side of the story, at least for me. From a practical perspective, the ban makes even less sense, as I tried to explain in my post: it does no damage at all to the ultra-conservative Islamist ideology it is supposedly targeting -- it actually bolsters it. You make a whole community angry and disenfranchised and ripe for exploitation by hateful imams because why? You don't like seeing covered women around. 

Because we don't appreciate seeing the uniforms of fascist autocratic religious theocracies infiltrate our secular societies. Again, when the majority of Muslimahs are legally forced to wear these things, it makes the gullible few who ""choose"" to wear it irrelevant. 

&gt;The more subtle approach would be to let those women wear whatever they want and instead focus on the next generation through education.

Not our job to pander to fascist religious ideologies under threat of further extremism. They can integrate or stay out. This is not unreasonable. 

&gt;It is not a coincidence that France has the most trouble with its Muslim minority.

France has the most Muslims out of any Western European country and Paris is the city with the highest Muslim population. No, it is definitely not a coincidence that they have the biggest problem with Muslims. It's almost like Islam is a conservative religious ideology with all the problems that form when a conservative religious ideology's population forms a significant percentage of a population. 

&gt;In the Netherlands, where I have spent some time, I see that younger Muslim women are much less likely to wear hijab than older ones, and they seem quite comfortable mingling with non-Muslims. That is what we should be striving for: inclusion, not confrontation.

I live in a (relatively liberal) Muslim country. The majority of Muslims worldwide do not share your sheltered, self indulgent ""inclusion"" attitude. They are not interested in harmony. As far as they are concerned, Islam is the only right way. The tudung is required by law, dog ownership is heavily discouraged, other religions are not allowed to publically proselytize, non-muslim minorities are constantly discriminated against, and the Adhan is blasted out on loudspeaker 5 times a day."
182,eo8yjko,So you admit that Muslim women are not a threat to banks.  Thanks for admitting you were wrong. Have a great day.
183,eq5gbsb,"As a black ***person*** period, I can't imagine walking away from my own child, unless I was 100% certain that they would have every opportunity afforded to them and I couldn't afford to give the child at least half of the opportunities.  

It's sad because BW weren't the ones that really emasculated BM, the United States government did; yet, BW are the ones that get the blame. BW were the ones left holding the bag and they weren't going to let anybody walk over them, because when you have children, there is no time for bullshit.  

I watched my mother take unspeakable beatings, work two jobs, run behind my father to get child support and have him turn around and beat her to get it back. I know why BW in the 80s started the mantras _BM ain't no good_ and _I can do bad all by myself_.  

It wasn't just my father! I would go over to other black kids' homes and the same story was being played out. It's a shame, because they are the most beautiful men on the planet, but the few that get it have made _the switch_ or are gay.  

I understood _Men are not Broken_ as this: Men are fucked up but they know exactly what they are doing. Unfortunately, this does not answer why they are so fucked up and willing to act on it.  

Look at the extreme Islamic men, are they so weak that they can't handle seeing any part of a woman except her eyes? Are they so insecure that a woman practically has to be imprisoned? Can you imagine living in a world where your younger brother could possibly get you killed just by telling a lie?  

The men of the West are not much better. Even when a woman is pulling her weight and theirs too, they pay her less. The moment she gets pregnant she becomes a burden! Women add value to businesses because we are capable of thinking about someone other than ourselves. They pretend to be so progressive but the forcible rape numbers are a disgrace.  

Back to white people. One half black president sent this nation into chaos! I think because his wife was actually black and not ""high yella"" or white, he threw many of them for a curve. This is when I became aware that white people secretly expect us to exact some nationwide coordinated ultra-violent revenge.  

They have all the power, all the guns, all the money! What can we actually do to them? Why when there are so many possible and more powerful enemies are they still worried about us?  

At the rate we're going, it will take millennia to catch up to where they are now in 2019, by then we'd still be in the Dark Ages compared to them. This is why I say their hatred is an anomaly. Unless we're the only ones paying for anything in the States, we pose no substantial threat to them.

Darn I went off on a tangent again. It feels good not wondering what the hell is wrong with men that want to be women for a change!"
184,em6xy63,"&gt;The burka is a tool of religious oppression

Sometimes, but not always. Many women feel comfortable wearing them, and even feel uncomfortable without them. You can argue they were brainwashed into thinking this way - but the fact of the matter is Burkas are a tool many good people find essential to daily life.

Telling those people they can't take pride in their culture / appearance, or that showing off their clothing is immoral because it might also glorify oppression, is kind of a dick move (it's clear you're a good person, and didn't intend to disenfranchise anybody, but this is how it makes many Muslim women feel).

The focus on symbolism is the problem here. Tools are just a means to an end, and can be used for good or bad. A burka's just a piece of cloth - it's neither moral nor immoral, it's amoral. If the problem is people using it to cover up unwilling women under threat of punishment, the issue is that coercion. Not the symbolism.

Women should absolutely be free to choose what they want to wear, and it's true many Muslim women are denied that choice. It's this denial of choice that we should take issue with, not the burka."
185,emk3nlh,"&gt;If there were a legitimate Caliphate (one supported by major scholars that abides by set conditions, etc. not the ISIS bs), I'd consider leaving and many many other Muslims would as well (I'd say there would be millions who might leave).

I agree with you that muslim countries are not perfect. And that an ideal situation would be to have a caliphate. 

But there is still a chance you might be wrong about your interpretation, and it's too big of a risk to take. What if angels take you on death and ask you why were you living in a country of decadence when you could have lived in a country with muslim customs ? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;1. If a Muslim is forced by his circumstances to emigrate, e.g. he is persecuted in his country or imprisoned, or his property is confiscated etc., without his having committed any crime, and he sees no way out for himself other than to emigrate to a foreign country, then he would be permitted to do so in such a case without any karahat (abhorrence) whatsoever as long as he resolves to protect his faith, and keep himself away from the widespread evil found there.

I agree that forced circumstances would warrant immigration to another country, but why choose a kafir country and not **another** muslim country ? If say, you are persecuted in Egypt why go to the US when you could go to a gulf country or to Malaysia or North Africa or Turkey ? 

&gt;2. Similarly, if a Muslim is forced to emigrate due to his financial situation, i.e. he cannot find the necessary means of subsistence despite extensive effort and he sees no alternative other than emigration to a non-Muslim country, then he is permitted to emigrate subject to the above conditions. Earning a livelihood through permissible means is also a duty for a Muslim, afterc his other fard duties, and the Shariah has not specified a certain place for it. Allah Ta'ala says: ""He is the one who has made the earth manageable for you. So traverse you through its tracts, and enjoy of the sustenance that He furnishes; and unto Him is the resurrection. \[Al-Mulk 67:15\]

I again agree that in case that a muslim has nothing to eat and cannot find a job, it is permissible for him to immigrate. Only there are two problems : 

\- Why go to a non muslim country insteead of a muslim one that provides better job opportunities ? 

\- How many people are really in this situation ? Not much, anyone can have a job in muslim countries to have what to eat and a place to stay. There is a hadith about the prophet pbuh when Umar came to visit him one day and he saw that his back was marked with the fibers of his rough palm tree bed and Umar started to weep, he told the prophet : you are the leader of the muslims and you live in such horrible conditions, while the persians and romans have better life, and the prophet replied : that this life is for the disbelievers and the afterrlife is for muslims. 

\- The problem then is that few people can claim they fall in this category of not being able to find a job and food and shelter. Syrian people and Yemenis can use this justifications but not other muslims in other normal muslim conutries. Sometimes when people say they cannot find jobs , they actually mean they cannot find jobs ""that they like"" would these people have an excuse then ? 

&gt;3. If a Muslim adopts the nationality of an non-Muslim country for the purpose of calling its people towards Islam, or to convey Islamic laws to the Muslims residing there, and to encourage them to stay firm on their faith, then this is not only permissible, but also a source of reward. Many of the Sahabah and Tabi'een settled in distant Kuffar lands for this very purpose, and this action of theirs is counted amongst their virtues and points of merit.

I completely agree with this point, people who are active in Dawah are justified in staying in kafir countries. Only problem is not many muslim people in these countries make dawah. 

&gt;4. If a person has enough means of livelihood available to him in his native country for him to be able to live according to the (average) standard of his people, but he emigrates in order to raise his standard of living and live a life of luxury and comfort, then emigration for such a purpose has at least some degree of karahat in it, because such a person is throwing himself into a storm of evil, and endangering his faith and moral character without there being any necessity for it. Experience shows that the people who settle in non-Muslim countries for luxury and comfort find their religious restraint diminishing in the face of many temptations of evil.

This mufti says there is at least makruh (dislike), but all other muftis say immigrating for this reason is haram (completely forbidden) because the verse of the Quran is very serious. We are talking hellfire, it's not a game, so we shouldn't take risks going to non muslim countries. This is even if we don't take into consideration that our children have 10 times more chance to leave Islam in non muslim countries. 

&gt;5. Finally, if a person adopts a non-Muslim nationality solely for the purpose of increasing his standing in society, and as a matter of pride, or in preference to a Muslim nationality, or in imitation of the Kuffar then all such actions are Haram without exception. There is no need to cite evidence for this.

I agree with this

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It is permissible for them to remain on two conditions:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. That they are able to openly establish the main rituals of Islam, such as the prayer, including the Eid prayer and the Friday prayer, zakat and fasting.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. That their religion is not under threat, meaning that they are not forced to do something which is forbidden or prevented from doing fulfilling any of their religious obligations and they do not fear that their children’s faith will be corrupted or lost.

&amp;#x200B;

1. You cannot practice Islam properly in non muslim countries. In France you cannot wear Hijab in certain jobs. Muslim women are persecuted in the streets and on the media. You can't pray at work. You cannot have a job if you refuse to shake hands with the other gender. If you want to sacrifice a lamb in Eid, it is forbidden to do it in your house, you need someone else to do it for you .... and another 100 reasons. This is called compromising religion and this is what the verse of hellfire is talking about 

2. Religion is very much under threat in non muslim countries. In the US 24% of muslims have left Islam"
186,ejngxli,"&gt; All it comes down to IMO is who's plight you're more concerned with. The woman being thrown in jail or under threat of violence for not wearing one or the woman who've been pushed around, insulted and looked down upon in the West because they want to wear one.

That's the worst way to look at it. 

Here's a radical idea: Muslim women are human beings who should get to decide what they want to wear. For many of them the hijab is a symbol of their faith and they should get to wear it if they want. For others they can't be bothered. That's fine too. **It's a free country.**

See, if people actually cared about freedom, then this entire ""debate"" could be resolved rationally. It's perfectly rational to criticize the Iranian government who want to control what women wear. It's also perfectly rational to criticize idiots like Majid who also want to control what Muslim women wear. See how that works?

But this is not about rationality or freedom or anything of the sort. What motivates those who get triggered by the hijab is much darker."

However earnest these groups may be about their support for Israel, they are explicitly in the business of trading influence for money. This isn’t limited to AIPAC; for instance, casino magnate and right-wing Israel supporter Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam spent $55 million in the 2018 election cycle to maintain Republican control of Congress. In recent years, the interests of these groups have dovetailed with those of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf monarchies, defense contractors, millenarian evangelical Christian Zionists, and other assorted war hawks. The Israel lobby is indeed a big tent, and it has welcomed in a wide range of right-wing interests that extend beyond the American Jewish community.

This coordinated outrage should come as no surprise. Since Omar and Tlaib were elected this past fall, the Israel lobby has perceived them as a threat. The two Muslim women are the first-ever supporters of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement in Congress, and their vocal criticism of Israel points to a schism in the Democratic Party over the bipartisan consensus so painstakingly crafted by donors and pro-Israel activists over the past few decades.

That consensus has held, in large part, because it has so effectively stamped out voices critical of the Israel lobby in progressive circles.

Though this schism is centered on policy, the Islamophobic subtext is clear and undeniable. The attacks on Omar recall the attacks on another Muslim congressman critical of the Israeli government, Keith Ellison, now the attorney general of Minnesota.

History is repeating itself. Omar, like Ellison, is under siege for describing honestly how the influence of pro-Israel activism produces disastrous policy.

192,ear66tt,"Thanks for offering some perspective. I grew up in a very religious household as well and did the same thing as you - argued on the internet about it when I was young and eventually realized most religions follow the same set of ideals that involve women being oppressed.

I imagine many Muslim women feel trapped because I know some Christian women do. What the other person said is correct - we should be able to criticize a patriarchal religion without being racist towards people. Please know that I despise all patriarchal religions equally, and have no issue with individual Muslim people (as long as they aren’t men who hurt women). I agree that Muslims are disliked by many right wing people and I understand how criticism of Islam can turn into racism. With the exception of this post, I generally boost the voices of ex Muslim women rather than interjecting my own opinion for this reason. And more importantly, ex Muslim women are under threat of violence and very persecuted and deserve to have a voice, especially since many on the left criticize them for their views.

And I also agree that atheist/“liberated” societies can also be patriarchal and anti-women."
193,ebv9u98,"Have you seen the Islamic discourse over the past couple of years? Conservative Islam is being taught as being the only way to practice Islam. Anything else that deviates from that is being framed as an existential threat to Islam. At least online it is.

195,e8kvk33,"So that’s a super biased opinion piece on some terrible UK website that just tried to give my tablet cancer. Just as a warning to others.

Additional warnings - /u/blueriverblues is an unapologetic white nationalist who has tried to spread several racist, pseudo-intellectual Bannon-esque arguments in this thread. So keep that in mind too.

Let’s cut through this shit: democratic societies are rooted in the concept of individual liberty. The right to vote, the right to speak against power, the right to defend yourself, the right to practice any faith you choose. That’s the baseline.

Western democracies have been subsumed over recent years by anti-Muslim hostility, nurtured by rightwing fear-mongering and good old fashioned scapegoating (favorite cocktail of authoritarians throughout history). First it became acceptable to insult Muslims, then attack them, then it became a matter of political will, manifest in such blunders as Brexit and Donald Trump.

The idea of “sharia law” taking over, or that Islam is “incompatible” with modernity, or that Muslims are innately dangerous and prone to crime is **100% bullshit.** The idea that refugees are a threat to society is stale and predictable xenophobia. The idea that rightwingers are suddenly concerned about what Muslim women are wearing is a transparent excuse to mainstream their attacks against Islam itself.

White nationalism is a very real and growing threat throughout the West, and it’s being driven mainly by this antagonism against a religion of nearly two billion unique humans beings. The woman in this photo is British. She’s a creative cosplayer and social media user. She’s not oppressed by Islam - though I suspect she’s not feeling super great about the rightwing hate and prejudice directed towards her community.

Fundamentalism is a problem for any religion or ideology. The oppression of women in islamic states is a real and complex issue, involving geopolitics and socioeconomic turmoil and regressive forces vying for influence. The solution is not to further demonize an entire religion. Support Muslims as they navigate obstacles and attacks both in the Middle East and in easingly intolerant West. Support the organizations who are trying to change things for the better. Have some empathy and compassion. And don’t fall for white nationalist “concern trolling” bullshit."
196,e8lp7u2,"I am beginning to have the faint feeling that we have basically the same stance in a lot of things, although coming to this point by quite different conclusions sometimes.

&gt; Those sjws are starting to look like nazis to me. 

Because there is no difference between rightwing fascim and leftwing fascism. I can't remember his name right now, but as this one italian author and anti-fascist once said after WW 2 (and I am paraphrasing here) *""When fascism comes back it will not say 'I am fascism', it will say 'I am anti-fascism'.""*

Have you read Hitlers ""Mein Kampf""? Apart from being a terrible, convoluted read, it is quite interesting in many regards. Hitlers national-socialism was not only pieced together with many different parts stolen from other movements, it was a *reaction* to the increasing threat of communism and the communist movement. And this is true for the italian fascism as well, they have started as socialists who were then quickly seen as a target by the russian and international communists, since they refused to give up on things like nation and national identity, hence the name national-*socialism*. In fact fascism has learned *a lot* from communism and in many ways, it was a reaction. 

Communism and fascism are two sides of the same coin, the come from the very same mold, that is why SJWs and especially Antifa look so much like fascists. Because they are. Same attitude, same methods. 

Also, this is not about economy. It really isn't. Sure, communism or socialism *will* ruin every economy over time and this is something we also see here. It is quite scary to see how many companies, corporations or even states are artificially kept alive by cheap loans they will never have to pay back and that the EU now owns a massive part of those debts and thus, those companies. It's almost as if the EU wants to socialise the economy in Europe through the backdoor. But the endgoal are the EUSSR and global socialism. 

And feminism, although very effective, is just a means to the end. If it would not have been feminism, it would have been something else. Although I am with you in regards of women having the right to vote, this was the beginning of the end, but this was something that was quickly discovered by post-modernists as an effective means to destroy the society we have now.

Just look at how feminism and the SJW mindset work, this irreconcilable mindset, the inability to have a conversation with ""the enemy"", the ""long march through the institution"" and the destruction of institutions from within, the idea that everyone who is not with you is against you... and then compare it with the mindset of the Frankfurt School and what people like Adorno have said and propagated... you might be surprised.

Anyway, I really don't understand which role you attribute to islam. Yes, you sound like an apologist to me, I admit that. Islam is better here, islam is better there... quess what, it is not. There is not one redeeming quality about islam. And you think women have no power in islam? Well, in a way this is true, just look at islamic countries or have a walk through a district in your city where many muslims live (assuming you survive that). But then again I have heard and read the statements of more than one muslim woman who are happy with the system, because it removes all responsibilities from them and gives them complete maintenance, while still giving them the option to exert immense power. Who, do you think, is teaching their sons? Who is teaching them muslim faith and morals, tells them that women without a headscarf or non-muslim women are sluts? Who keeps the system running behind doors? Because behind close doors many muslim men are incredible cucks, even when they play the macho in public.

They will destroy everything here in Europe we hold dear, things that would have survived an economical collapse. Churches, museums and a lot of cultural monuments will be gone, for instance. Remember the Buddhas of Bamiyan? This is what is going to happen here as well. Islam will make the coming crisis much, much worse, it will ruin every chance we have to survive this as a culture and as individuals. "

&gt;During the nine-month-long Bangladesh war for independence, members of the Pakistani military and supporting Islamist militias from Jamaat-e-Islami killed up to 3,000,000 people and raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women, according to Bangladeshi and Indian sources, in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape. In December 2011, a BBC News report cited unnamed ""independent researchers"" as claiming that between 300,000 and 500,000 people were killed.The actions against women were supported by Muslim religious leaders, who declared that Bengali women were gonimoter maal (Bengali for ""public property""). As a result of the conflict, a further eight to ten million people, mostly Hindus,fled the country at the time to seek refuge in neighbouring India. It is estimated that up to 30 million civilians became internally displaced.

Muslim immigration to the west.

I know they're not all bad.

But my god do they cause so many fking problems. How many hateful, violent preachers and followers can a religion have? UK has 2300 muslims on a watch list. Belgium, Sweden, France, Germany also have a fuck load.

Like hate preaching at mosques. I live in Sweden and we've had that many times - they usually preach death for homosexuals or for anyone who insults Mohammed.

Trying to enforce shariah on non muslims - like women for wearing skirts or if you just walk your dog through an area with a lot of muslims.

They don't try to integrate and it causes further problems. We're at odds with each other. They've very religious in a time we're moving away from it. (they should remember who's country they're living in)

When there's enough muslims in a western country, they will start trying to get shariah law. They already have a few pro shariah parties. There's fuck load amount of salafists in europe.

I don't want them to destroy our western culture and values. How would anyone feel seeing people come here who look down on your culture?  Who constantly attack us?

We've built such an amazing society. Now we have these backwards people trying to ruin it.

I don't want them to send us backwards. Even muslim women are against western feminism.  They wear hijabs and niqabs that just show they don't want to integrate.

We have all these values and freedoms and these people want to take them away. They have barbaric things like shariah. As a group, they are a threat to us.

If you look how many prevented attacks there is a scary amount. Uk would've had an attack every two months.

I know you shouldn't blame them all. But I truly hate them. Everything about them.

200,e40gpz4,"As Britain tangles with the issue of the veil, I remember wrestling with my own. It was the sound of polyester muffling my ears that I most detested. Traipsing around the Al-Faisaliah Mall in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, at the turn of the millennium, keeping my standard-issue hijab (or headscarf) secured while managing my floor-length abaya (an all-covering black gown) was my prime anxiety in public.

Too often, my nemesis – the hijab – would not stay. It would slip off silently, only for the ever vigilant religious police to ambush me with the admonition: “Cover your hair!”. There were even “Cover Your Hair!” fridge magnets back then.

Yet, 20 years later, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is calling for the kingdom to adopt a more moderate form of Islam, going so far as to announce that women no longer need to wear traditional black abayas or headscarves.

His country is not alone. Within days of the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, newly elected President Sisi of Egypt addressed the clerics of Al Azhar University, the oldest seat of learning of Sunni Islam, demanding a need for “religious revolution” and the rescue of Islam from “ideology”. Sisi was referring to Islamism. Morocco is sealing shut the factories which weave the fabric to make burkas. Turkey strictly forbids the niqab (the veil that leaves all the face covered apart from the eyes) and even the hijab among its judicial and military personnel.

*""In mocking the niqab, Boris is deemed to have mocked Islam. He did not. Like many other Muslim women, I am thankful that Boris said what he did""*

Yet in 2018 Britain finds itself mummified within the niqab – literally unable to see and hear the reality of donning this garment. Fixated instead on the hysteria around Boris Johnson’s letter-box-cum-bank-robber analogy, the nation fails to recognise that Mr Johnson generously – but, in my view as an observant Muslim woman, mistakenly – welcomed British Muslim women as free to choose to wear the veil.

In mocking the niqab, Boris is deemed to have mocked Islam. He did not. Like many other Muslim women, I am thankful that Boris said what he did. To criticise the niqab and to criticise Muslim women are two very different things.

So why are many Muslims against the niqab? Because we know Islamism, a profound and totalitarian distortion of Muslim belief, when we see it.

I first stared Islamism in the eye in 2012. I was in the Swat Valley of Pakistan meeting with former child Taliban operatives as they told me their routes towards radicalisation. I have met with Islamism in America as I testified to Capitol Hill on the real problem of domestic radicalisation revealed by migrant parents who had lost their American-born children to Somalia’s Al-Shabaab.

This spring I met with Islamism in Kurdistan, newly liberated from Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant by the fearless Peshmerga, where I spoke with Kurdish commanders – Muslim men and Muslim women – who had heroically led the offensive to defeat the most heinous manifestation of violent Islamism to date. The Peshmerga freed Yazidi women and girls who were forced into sexual slavery by Isil and required to wear the veil. When such women were liberated from Isil, the first thing they did was to burn their niqabs.

The adoption of the face veil represents a uniquely Islamist obsession, not an Islamic rite. Those that reject the burka or niqab – whether British American Muslims like me, or Peshmerga Muslim commanders in Kurdistan – are deemed impure or inauthentic by the Islamist.

Islamism is obsessed with the concepts of purity and authenticity. Battling for the sole claim to authenticity is central to its rejection of all other Muslims and of course all who are not Muslim. This is in stark contrast with the Koran, which announces “to each is sent a law and a way”, and is a complete departure from the foundational contract of Islam with the believer: there can be no compulsion in belief.

I fully back Boris’s right to objectify the veil because the veil itself is an instrument of objectification. Unlike him, however, I would ban the niqab from British streets altogether. Its true purpose is to demarcate the wearer and the secular world, to overshadow the public space. It derives from misogyny. Islamism views women as a threat to society, so it is best that they are seen and not heard. Some women even remain veiled inside their family homes. My religion does mandate modesty, but there is no basis in Islam for the niqab.

The reaction to Boris’s comments, particularly the false accusation of Islamophobia, plays into the Islamists’ hands. It masks the diversity of Muslim opinion, treating voices like mine as if they do not exist, and aided by pseudo-intellectual liberals in the West, allows Islamists to falsely present their dress code as the only true face of Islam.

One of my brothers has expressed deep concern at my anti-niqab stance, fearing I am inviting adversity to the lives of Muslim women in Europe. Certainly, with the rise of anti-Muslim xenophobia, this is a valid worry. My other brother sees both sides of the problem, the distortion of an Islamic directive – to be modestly dressed – and the bind any regulation of clothing places on a secular liberal democratic society. My mother, a deeply observant pluralist Muslim, and my father are firmly in my camp.

Among my Arab Muslim friends, a former female colleague sympathises with Muslim women who adopt the niqab, but she believes its basis in Islam is controversial, to say the least. When weighed against the freedom of religion, economic stability, and safety from wars and persecution that life in the secular liberal West provides, however, she sees abandoning the niqab as not unreasonable.

Crucially, these differing opinions are tolerated as part of each of our personal expressions, and experiences, of Islam. They are not tolerated by the Islamists, as I have found myself, having received threatening and vulgar abuse for speaking out. If we do not defend our public spaces as secular shrines to pluralism, not only will public discourse on these issues be extinguished, but it will become that much harder for anti-Islamist Muslims like me to speak out. That’s why I back Boris."
201,e40r8xy," \*\*Part 3/3\*\*

Here are a few more quotes you might find interesting:

\&gt; Misogyny is a self-masking problem. Trying to draw attention to it is illicit by the lights of the phenomenon itself, since women are supposed to minister to others rather than solicit moral attention an concern on their own behalf. (p. 281-282)

A good example of this is when Rebecca Watson made an offhand comment about feeling uncomfortable when a stranger in an elevator invited her to his room at 4 am, and Richard Dawkins responded by mocking her for the petty, immoral selfishness of even mentioning such a minor complaint in a world where Muslim women are having their genitals cut off. The implication was that, by talking about her own experience, she was being selfish and neglecting her duty to care for others. 

Using the fact that some women have things much worse to discredit and shame women who want to improve things in their own backyard is an example of the kind of misogyny Manne is describing here. Even Dawkins later admitted that it’s stupid to use a hierarchy of victimhood to shut down debate. 

………….

\&gt; Misogyny often involves distinguishing between “good” and “bad” women, by the lights of their conforming to patriarchal norms and values … it’s not surprising that women who aspire to be “good” have social incentives to distance themselves from a woman deemed “bad.” (p. 263)

That quote really stood out to me after seeing someone say this on the Very Bad Wizards post I made about feminism:

\&gt; I wouldn't piss on a modern or radfem if they were on fire. That kind of toxic supremacy can fuck right off. Paglia and Sommers are some cool ladies with whom I wholeheartedly agree.

In my personal opinion, Paglia and Sommers are “cool ladies” because they’re “good women” by Manne’s definition: they’re serving patriarchal norms and values. Don’t get me wrong, there’s a lot to like about Christina Hoff Sommers: she’s cute, smart, funny, sharp, creative, and kind of a badass. I’m kinda jealous that she’s not \*my\* stepmom. But she’s using her charm and power to make boys on the internet feel justified in hating women who criticize video games. She’s embodying the “good mother” (or “based mom”) those boys feel they deserve—a woman who validates and soothes all their little grievances, even when those grievances are just about no longer being able to dominate others or do whatever they want without having their bullshit pointed out to them. She’s telling Dave Rubin, with her cute little smile, that she wants to make him a sandwich.

………..

Here’s Manne talking about her personal experience \*\*being a woman on the internet\*\*:

\&gt; All it takes to garner these kinds of moral reactions \[“the usual rapey, misspelled, and lately anti-semitic bilge water”\], seemingly is being a woman who is perceived as taking up male-dominated space without pandering to patriarchal interests and vanities. (p. 288-289)

I don’t think women necessarily get more hate on the internet than men do. It seems like everyone is terrible to everyone on the internet. But I wouldn’t be surprised if women get more rape threats. And women, for whatever reason, might be more turned off by rape threats than men are. Women might also have been socialized in a way that makes them less skilled at fighting back against online attacks. They might not take as much joy in put-downs and insults as men do. There could be biological reasons for this. Either way, I don’t see why the answer to this problem has to be “if you can’t handle the heat, get out of the kitchen.” Maybe the kitchen is too hot to be healthy for anybody. 

……

She also talks about the idea of “\*\*victim culture\*\*,” which “trades on the trope of a passive female victim, the princess in the castle, waiting to be rescued by a princely hero” (I think Christina Hoff Sommers would call this “fainting couch feminism”). Manne thinks this trope is used to discredit women who talk about legitimate grievances. Manne thinks that you can admit to being a victim (i.e., someone who has been victimized) without being this weak, lazy stereotype. “There is nothing wrong with claiming to be a victim when you are one.” (p. 225). Manne thinks that saying that you have been victimized actually takes a lot of courage:

\&gt; Agency is not lacking when a woman is taking it upon herself to tell her story, or play her part, in a manner that may be subversive or expose the bully using nothing other than his own behavior to embarrass him. (p. 305) 

and:

\&gt; coming forward can be an act of subversion, insofar as it wrestles the narrative away from the dominant and default versions, and makes one’s position salient to those who would otherwise remain oblivious. Third parties may sympathize or not; they may in fact be \*more\*, rather than less, hostile and resentful. But at least they will be privy to the reality of the injury, or the fact of the ongoing domination. And this can matter, quite properly, to people who have been victimized.

………..

To end with a quote you might agree with, here is Manne disagreeing with feminists who think that misogyny is the result of people viewing women as less-than-human:

\&gt; a fellow human being is … also an intelligible rival, enemy, usurper, insubordinate, betrayer, etc. Moreover, in being capable of rationality, agency, autonomy, and judgement, they are also someone who could coerce, manipulate, humiliate, or shame you. In being capable of abstract relational thought and congruent moral emotions, they are capable of harboring malice and plotting against you. In being capable of valuing, they may value what you abhor and abhor what you value. They may hence be a threat to all that you cherish

Your move.

202,e43ahiq,"It's hilarious how the media always lies about these things. Boris Johnson said the other day something about burkas should be banned for being a security threat or some shit I didn't see it.

I don’t like the hijab because it is an oppressive garment Muslim women are forced to wear in the name of modesty.

206,e1ewjun,"&gt; It presents a safety issue

So do people wearing cloths. They could hide guns under them. Or Trench coats, someone could hide a bomb in it.

The relevant question is, is it actually happening? Can you justify a ban by showing that face coverings worn by Muslim women are actually and functionally a security threat.

The fact is, face coverings when worn by Muslim women are not creating a significant threat. We've had no related crime waves to justify such a ban under the guise of security.

The only reason people are saying security, is because if not that then you simply can't do it while also respecting their right to free expression."
207,e1gemuq,"Its complicated, like prostitution.

I support religious freedom like I support any form of sexual intercourse between consenting adults.

But just like with many prostitutes being victims of sex trafficking, many (not all or even most) Muslim women are coerced into staying in the religion they were born into under threat of ostracizion up to honor killings, even in Western countries.

Do you keep the law lax to give women making an autonomous decision more freedom, or add restriction to protect those who don't have the autonomy themselves?

210,dwg4hk8,"Hahaha! Are you a man or a woman? Muslim women are victims not perpetrators (usually). So I like them for not being the problem. I'd be surprised that a man wish for death in the land of misogyny.

I know right, people here seem enlightened in their own flaws, so they're ok with me for hating the bullshit too.

I think that it's because of over population, Muslim make war for resources... No its worse... they consider us infidel to their god that must be punished. I never swore loyalty so I can't be infidel. And if it's because people don't even know about Allah because they were born where people don't teach about him, then they're just misguided children. They should be shown the way back home, killing them isn't a good way to show his greatness. Christianity did this shit with the crusades and other horrors... apparently Muslims' religion is younger, so they're at that phase now... which looks really barbaric to us... Maybe if they weren't so repressed they'd be able to catch up... but when they come in America, they kill their own family if they adapt to the new country... damn if you hate us that much don't come here... if you come here because life is better, then try our ways. If people bring the same attitude that made a shitty country to live in, with no job opportunities, then clinging to the mentality here can only make them miss out and make the country worse if they succeed. They can't just enjoy the fruits of capitalism and then hate us for it, because when they do they become one of us... I hate blind obedience to religion. Recruiting bullied kids who are desperate to belong and who'd rather die than be lonely... to send them in suicide missions... that's so awful... teach them to set a timer so they can live to kill another day... If they threat their people as disposable, then it's not tempting to join them. Maybe it's revenge for blowing their kids for oil... I can't blame them for that. But I blame them for what they do to their mother, sisters, lovers, daughters... If a god wants me to be hurt, he's not my god."

212,ds0djmi,"Rouhani has accurately realised that the current scale of the protests are not an existential threat to the regime and therefore that a crackdown would make things much worse.  


Two points, though:

* public dissent, especially towards the concept of the Islamic Republic is still not tolerated, will lead to arrest by the police and so on. Basic freedoms like the ability not wear a headscarf (even for non-Muslim women) are still not in place

* the protests right now are small enough not to pose any threat to power. The real question of tolerance is that if you see many hundreds of thousands or millions in the streets, how will the government reaction differ?  It’s very easy to tolerate a few hundred or thousand protesting - much more difficult if it’s enough to actually overthrow the regime if they wanted. "
213,dnjuudy,"And the kulchas have arrived. Its interesting to see how every topic gets diverted to being a muslim issue. Its like the oxygen for every kulcha.

As a Muslim woman, I don't need savarna liberals sermonising me. Muslim women have fought and achieved a lot. And just like other women, you don't need to ""rebel"" or push your way through always. Whether it be education or jobs, they are pushing the boundaries and succeeding similar to women from other communities.  

As for muslim women, the biggest threat they face is from the hindutwa groups. They fear for their safety specially in a nation where people who call for raping even dead muslim women are rewarded with political posts, people who spear headed riots and called for muslim women to be raped are roaming free on bail and extended parole thanks to the largesse of the judicial system with favourable govts in tow.

Inspite of these hurdles, muslim women seem to be making strides. So spare me and other Muslim women your faux concern.

"
214,dn2fni8,"The greatest threat to feminism is women who are content with being less than men. And while I'd rather not say it, the majority of Muslim women are either fine with it or publicly claim they are out of fear for their safety. The west has a completely different problem, with western feminists defending the tools &amp; organisations through which women are oppressed and western female Muslims feeling persecuted for being treated equally alongside everyone-else and then thrusting themselves into strict, vile &amp; brutal interpretations of Islam (out of a desire to be superior to everyone else); the latter is in reference to Nadia Khan. So for what it's  worth, I don't feel women within Islam &amp; Islamic countries who haven't even the ability to walk outside without a man can truly advocate for change in a reasonable way. The only way for things to change is the west, but they're too busy cowering from fear of being labelled Islamaphobe to have any real impact."
215,dkbtolt,"It may seem like this is an America bro problem and, by extension, a white bro problem, but it's really a human problem. The problem being IMO: women are viewed as a commodity rather than as individuals in their respective ""groups"", whether that be ethnic, religious, national groups. Any attempt by men outside those groups to have a relationship with one is perceived as a threat on their ""resources"" rather than women taking agency with regards to whom they choose to date.

You can find examples of this all over the Internet from any race (r/hapas loves hating on white dudes dating Asian women.), religion (Christians and Hindus terrified Muslim migrants will steal their women. But you never hear the opposite because Muslim women are straight up FORBIDDEN to marry non-Muslim).

I currently work in West Africa with larger number of other Americans workers. A decent number of female Americans date and even marry men from here (just had three marriages this last year). I know of absolutely ZERO Male worker-native female relationships and certainly have never heard of any marriages (and it's not because the women here aren't beautiful, let me tell you...).

Simple truth: until women are given the same agency to choose who they date as men this isn't going to stop anywhere.

Also: see this interesting article where an Indian women discusses here tribulations dating a marrying and white man in her country.

"
216,dkejlmu,"&gt;Yes, it is true that in Western countries Muslim women are fairly treated, but that is because their religion does not make legal decisions like it does in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Yemen, etc.

I don't believe *any* religion should be making the legal decisions. The inherent threat to freedom is too much, even when it's Christianity in America.

Again, *that doesn't make Islam incompatible with women's rights*.

Just because religion *can* be abused does not mean that it is inherently abusive.

And frankly, you've done nothing to rebut the fact that modern Muslim American women are functioning members of our society, partners toward progress and civic freedoms.

There is no rule that religion must be strictly interpreted to be ""true."" This is in fact a No True Scotsman and subtly ignores the many compromises American Christians and Jews make on a daily basis."
217,dkno2pb,"Let me try...

It is claimed by Western Muslim women that Hijab is liberating. Here is the logic...

1. Participating in western society without separation of sexes means coming in contact with non-relative males.
2. If a man is aroused because of me then according to my religion it is my fault.
3. If such man acts upon his arousal because of me, it is my fault
4. I wear hijab so that non-relative men wouldn't be aroused by me.
5. Which allows me to go about my business without fear of sexual assault, which would be entirely my fault, which would result into me being dishonored and disowned by my family.
6. Hence burqa is liberating


Here is my view on it as a western man...

1. I grant women right to dress as they wish. There is not much ""granting"" going on, it is their right, unquestioned.
2. Muslim women think that if someone sexually assaults them it is the woman's fault
3. I don't want to be insulted by a woman who thinks that I can't control my urge, that I won't come to her aid, that I won't punish her attackers, that I would hold her responsible for the sexual attack, that I support such society.
4. While I grant that Muslim women can choose to dress as they want, what the dress symbolizes is a direct assertion that the western society has failed to protect the women, even in the most populated, civilized parts of our society and the women must wear burqa to operate securely within the western society. That's a direct allegation against my will, my rights, my capabilities. I can't fathom being responsible for a society where women feel this way.


Does that make sense?

I see a woman in burqa and I feel like I failed as a western man in providing enough protection, enough confidence where that woman feels the need to cover herself up to that extent. Burqa is not a religious symbol for me, it is a slap in my face, it is a walking talking reminder that I failed. 

Is it wrong of me to suggest that the Muslim women shouldn't feel this way in western society with rule of law?

Continuing to how this is possibly seen by a new muslim refugee in the western world...

1. Western Muslim women choose to wear burqa accepting their fault if I am aroused by them.
2. Western non-muslim women choose to wear provocatively around me.
3. If western women didn't wanted my sexual advances, they would have covered themselves just as Muslim women do.
4. How is this different from where I came from? Good women covered themselves, where I came from. Slutty women showed skin where I come from. I was told it would be different here, but look at all these good women covering themselves up correctly.
5. therefore women not covering themselves are asking for my advances. I was told western world is sexually liberated, here is my chance to see if it is real.

Do you not think some refugees are coming to this logical conclusion based on their observations of burqa wearing women in the west?

Why don't Muslim women stand in solidarity with all women in claiming that showing one's hair is not an invitation for sexual advances from just about anyone who is able to see the hair, just because they are able to see my hair? If you can't do it in the western world where the entire might of the state and will of the people would come to your aid if you choose not to wear burqa, if you can't do it here, where can you do it? Is it not accepting defeat? I for one is not willing to accept defeat on this issue. 

Tell me why I am wrong. Correct me. I want to be corrected if I am wrong.

Here is what I think is going on... Muslim women don't wear burqa as a choice. They are well aware of their freedoms in western society. They see other women exercising their right to dress as they wish everyday. What Muslim women are scared of are Muslim men, religious Muslim men, who they can run into with uncovered hair and would be looked down upon. ""Beta purda karo, purda"". I can imagine how that sound would pour hot iron into a Muslim woman's ears. They are playing it safe by wearing burqa, against the threat of Muslim men. Again, failure of western society and western might of the state to make them feel secure enough against the judging muslim religious men. I sympathize with Muslim women, but I beg them to exercise their freedom to dress as they want, without fear of oppression from Muslim men. It has to start with them making the courageous choice, we will offer the protection, but we can't force courage upon them. Give Western society a chance, give western men a chance to protect your freedoms, don't accept defeat without putting up a fight."
218,di8m5m5,"&gt; lol so did she stab herself multiple times?

That's not what I said, but:

* It's an old story
* No offender was found, so we don't know that he's white or that he targeted the woman for wearing a hijab

If this was such a common problem, you'd have millions of stories like this. The truth is that Muslims are not facing any incredible threat in the western world. In fact, Muslims are most at danger in their own countries, many of which have become warzones due to groups like the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, or ISIS.

&gt;muslim women are assaulted verbally and physically on a regular basis for wearing the hijab. 

Most of those 'assault and harassment' claims turn out to be hoaxes."

 ______ 
**Opinion: Mani Shankar Aiyar Is Wrong On Triple Talaq** 

 ______ 
The debate on triple

_talaq_

reinforces the fact that we are a patriarchal society and women fighting for
justice have to contend with opposition from different quarters including
progressive ones. If only Mani Shankar Aiyar had written a piece to support
the Muslim womens' struggle for gender justice rather than the

article

carried here it, would have helped the discourse against patriarchal norms in
marriage and family.

There have been a number of articles in the media trying to suggest that
triple

_talaq_

is not such a burning issue after all. Some have argued that Hindu women too
face injustice; some others have spoken about secularism being under threat;
some have spoken about the ideology of the current government. But for the
voices of the women themselves calling for an end to this unjust and unQuranic
practice, the attention would have nearly shifted away from the central
figure, the Muslim woman herself.

Mr Aiyar and the progressives must find other fronts for opposing the central
government and not place hurdles in the Muslim womens' struggle for gender
justice and equality.

It must be reiterated here that triple

_talaq_

takes place in our society despite there being no sanction for it in the
Quran. Besides, there are anecdotes from the life of the Prophet making it
amply clear how the Prophet considered triple

_talaq_

an unacceptable evil. Not just this, there are verses in the Quran calling for
attempts towards reconciliation involving both wife and husband as well as
mediation by members of both families. This process must go on for at least 90
days before it is decided that the differences are irreconcilable after which
the divorce can happen in a just and fair manner. This truth lies at the core
of the triple

_talaq_

issue and the rest of the arguments are attempts at obfuscation to preserve
male hegemony and privilege.

Our experience as a Muslim womens' organization working across different
states for over a decade now suggests that triple

_talaq_

causes a lot of pain, destitution, economic uncertainty and emotional trauma
for women. In our study

_Seeking Justice Within Family, A National Study on Muslim Womens' Views on
Reforms in Muslim Personal Law_

conducted in Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal, Karnataka, Bihar, Tamil Nadu,
Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Odisha, 4,710 Muslim women shared their
personal stories. Of the 525 divorced women, 346 or 65.9% were divorced
orally, 7.6% or 40 were divorced through a letter, 3.4% or 18 women were
divorced on phone, 3 on email, 1 via sms and 117 women through other methods.
In all, 78% or 408 women were divorced unilaterally and instantly. We also
found an overwhelming 88.3% or 4,159 women wanted the legal divorce method to
be the

_talaq-e-ahsan_

method spread over a period of 90 days and involving mutual negotiation and
avoiding arbitrariness. 92.1% women wanted a total ban on oral/unilateral
divorce or triple

_talaq_

. Besides, over 47% women didn't possess their own

_nikahnama_

.

So just what is the 0.3% frequency of the triple

_talaq_

argument that Mr Aiyar writes about based on an online study of 20,671
Muslims, of which 16,860 were men and only 3811 were women? Surely, he does
not expect the men who are the perpetrators of triple

_talaq_

to vouch for their own misdeeds! Besides, an overwhelming majority of Muslims
are poor and educationally deprived. The Sachar Report suggests that only one
in four Muslims is a graduate. Nobody knows whether these four include a
woman. It beats all common sense as to why would anyone conduct an online
survey on the subject of triple

_talaq_

specially since an overwhelming number of Muslim women can barely read or
write.

And if triple

_talaq_

were a ""dying practice"" as quoted by Mr Aiyar, why would so many Muslim women
be demanding an end to it? Why would so many cases be pending before different
family courts across the country? Why would over half a dozen women have
approached the Supreme Court? The Census of 2011 puts the divorce rate among
Muslims at 0.56% and 0.76% among Hindus. It is the unilateral arbitrary method
of divorce which is being questioned more than the rate of divorce. Our
experience also suggests that it is very difficult for a woman particularly
from a poor background to exercise her right to

_khula_

(divorce initiated by a wife) as granted by the religion. Harassment begins
the moment she expresses a desire for

_khula_

. She is asked to shell out money, forego her belongings, forego her

_mehr_

, give up her children. The path to

_khula_

is hardly as rosy as Mr Aiyar seems to suggest.

It is nobody's case that Indian women, be they Hindu or Christian or Parsi,
have attained freedom and equality. But Muslim women face legal discrimination
in the absence of a codified personal law. Parliament has passed laws and
amended laws which govern personal matters of Hindus and Christians. Whereas
the Shariat Application Act, 1937, gives no protection to Muslim women from
triple

_talaq_

,

_nikah halala_

, polygamy etc. It is a collective failure and, at times, the collusion of the
political class with conservative Muslim elements that has denied justice to
Muslim women in marriage and family matters. The Constitution allows for both
gender justice as well as religious freedom. Unilateral triple

_talaq_

can hardly be passed off as exercising of the right to religious freedom. As a
matter of fact, the right to religious freedom is given equally to male as
well as female citizens and it cannot be interpreted to mean a licence to men
to subjugate women.

The BJP government has been at the centre for only three years. There was no
BJP government in 1986 when Shah Bano was silenced by the Muslim patriarchs in
collusion with the government. Let the progressives including Mr Aiyar not use
as an excuse the politics that is identified with the BJP government. Will
they advocate for the continuance of male-dominated status quo just because PM
Modi spoke about Muslim women suffering on account of triple

_talaq_

? What prevented other political parties from coming out openly in support of
Muslim women? A secular, progressive person such as Mr Aiyar must recognize
the movement of Muslim women for gender justice and not give undue credit to
Hindutva groups. It is hard to believe that a rational-thinking person like
him can be assured by the dubious hypocritical statements of the AIMPLB (All
India Muslim Personal Law Board)! Even the AIMPLB does not claim that it will
carry out

_ijtihad_

! It is the Muslim women who are bringing about

_ijtihad _

through their conviction and actions. They want to be equal Muslims and equal
citizens.

True that there are over half a dozen judgments including the Bombay High
Court judgment in

_Dagdu Pathan v/s Rahimbi_

in 2002 and the Supreme Court verdict in

_Shamim Ara_

in 2002 over-ruling the validity of triple

_talaq_

, but those have not led to the curbing of this practice. Besides, why should
the husband be allowed an unfettered right to instant divorce? Why should the
husband not be brought under the ambit of law? Why should it be the wife's
burden to go to court and challenge triple

_talaq_

while her husband continues to enjoy normal life? Such disparity can hardly be
allowed to continue in a democracy.

Gender justice is a fundamental principle of Islam and yet Indian Muslim women
are unequal. The answer is a comprehensive reform in Muslim personal law.
Abolition of triple

_talaq_

is the first step that must be followed by a widespread social reform
movement. We are a multi-religious country where all personal laws of all
religions are being regulated - so why this special treatment to Muslim men?
More importantly, why should Muslim women tolerate injustice?

It is high time that elected representatives stop populist politics pandering
to patriarchal elements as practiced by them and instead abide by their
constitutional obligations of gender justice. The women of India are watching.

220,dhelr50,"Three women on the panel is a matter of social dynamics, not justice. Unless you're arguing that gender affects one's ability to reach a rational conclusion.

And as for social dynamics, they should fit the society they derive from if they are to be effective. A female majority on the panel is more a western dynamic, not much use in India.

Muslim women are already against triple talaq. They have a long history with the mullahs, they are portrayed as over-westernized whores, weakening Islam from the inside. Hindu or Christian women are the troublemakers, leading decent Muslim women astray with their independent ideas. Both create the narrative of Islam under threat, and that is NOT the narrative you want to fight. That way leads to rioting, murder, arson and jihad.

A winning narrative would be one where the mullahs are made to look dumb and ridiculous, objects of derision rather than defenders of the faith. An all-male panel composed of diverse religions looks impartial. They appear to be above the concerns, not personally involved. They set up a narrative of civilization which has moved on, versus barbarism and ignorance. They must remain polite, measured in their responses, aloof.

Muslim wome have a much better use. They are the foil to the Mullahs. They can get away laughing at the mullahs, abusing them on TV, quoting the Koran back at them. A Muslim woman can get away with anything without provoking the Islam under threat narrative, so long as she is not in a position of power. But if she's a judge, she'll certainly be accused of being a stooge for the majority."
221,fxtdiif,"As respectfully as I can say this, OP this isn't build a bear.
Finding a person who's right and aligns with your mindset is an obligation and that's valid. 

But objevtifiying an individual by sending a bloody checklist doesn't do you any favours. I understand you want a woman who's right for you but for once, just consider the difference in your upbringing and hers.

 A woman is raised to feel as if she's a baby-maker who needs to have a list of qualities for a man to make her his wife. She needs to be pretty but halal and a hijabi. She needs to cook and manage the housework but needs to have a fulfilling career.

 The way OP is raised and the way most muslim women are raised have stark contrast. For some women, marriage seems diabolical because that's how society perceives her. She's not a woman, she's someone's wife. You sending a checklist is only going to reinforce this and make her feel worse. 

You can't have the perfect wife, Allah didn't make us perfect and frankly, you're wrong for not leaving any room for discussion because that reflects how ingrained it is in you to have the last word (i read all thr comments and all your replies, and so far it seems to me at least that you like having the last word.  I'm bound to be wrong as i don't know you as a person but as to what you're saying here and the way you react, you're not doing yourself any favours). Instead of sending a list, you could try bringing up these topics gradually, you know, make her feel less like a commodity and more of a human. 

There's some things some people are bound to disagree over, E.G: The LGBTQ group to me is irrelevant as long as they don't barge into my Community and threaten my rights, i honestly don't care what they do. Also, i don't see what's wrong in being a leftist (then again I'm not very well-versed with politics and if you'd be willing, can you elaborate why you dislike leftists?

Also, i noticed a common trend where you ask people to help rephrase certain snippets which sound condescending, don't do that. Just it's a heartfelt suggestion. Instead, read over them, understand where you were wrong and try solving the problem yourself. If you're worried people won't reply to the modified post, PM me, I'd be glad to offer my insights and suggestions. 

About the 'last word' thing (kinda stuck with me). It seems as though you're expecting fights between you and your future wife where you will the one in the right and she will be wrong. It shows that you hold your opinion superior to hers and aren't willing to accept the fact that you may be wrong. A fight shouldn't be about who got the last word. It should be about both parties understanding that one is right and one is wrong and you need to understand, accept and learn from that."
222,fezn34h,"From what you've said, things don't sound too good. Islam may be only one thing, but it is indeed the elephant in the room, and an elephant-sized problem. And it creates other problems, for example, her family also not accepting you unless you convert to Islam (and maybe not even then depending on their culture). So if your girlfriend lets your not being a Muslim slide, they could pressure her or even shun or threaten her. You may also be expected to mix in with Muslim society and go to the Mosque etc.

Muslims are supposed to consider themselves slaves of Allah. Nothing is supposed to be more important than their faith - not love, not family ties, nothing. And (as you may know) Muslim women are prohibited from marrying non-Muslims. But if you pretend to convert, you'll be living a lie, and the Muslim community may be suspicious about your reasons for joining them.

The other thing to watch out for is that when people get older they not uncommonly become more strict in their faith. And if you did marry, your children would be considered Muslims by default, and would be expected to learn the Quran, go to Mosques, be circumcised, wear hijab etc. This problem may become larger.

What has your girlfriend sacrificed? Sadly it's not particularly likely you'll be able to mutually compromise enough."
223,fd40ns0,"Well, if he is from Europe: We have a plague called Islam. Muslim women are simply not allowed to be alone with other man (over 10 years) especially not without something to at least cover their legs and hair. Heck, we even have lots of security now in Hospitals because those families threaten (white) people/man when they want to visit their female relative while a Muslim women is in there as well.

So this, no one will tell you especially not our propaganda media, is because of Islam. And the Feminists and Gendertheologist are helping them, because muh-huh safe space blabla."

You want to claim ""it's culture and not religion""?

Stop spinning the argument and moving the goalpost. Don't come into this subreddit where women actively beg for help and advice to escape their abusive families and threats of murder for their apostasy because you ***feel*** like Muslim women are never *""beaten, raped, or victims of anything""*."

How many female heads of state has America produced?  Why should we believe that Muslim women are more oppressed than any other group of women?

227,ebojd5w,"I’m a gay disabled indigenous black woman and having my culture appropriated is as much part of my oppression as fearing for my life around the police, getting stalked in every retail store I go into, and being racially profiled by obnoxious white people. Just because someone somewhere might have it worse doesn’t mean that I don’t also have it bad? I’ve had Nazis threaten to murder and rape me to my face so maybe like fuck off? 

And Muslims in the U.S. face immense oppression and violence. Like I said (and maybe you can’t read???) oppression changes by region and religion. So like where you are you can be critical of Islam and the oppressive structure that stems from it, but in the U.S. Muslim women are murdered at an alarming rate just for walking down the street in a head scarf so yeah you can definitely fuck off. "
228,e5hf6hr,"That's not what /u/parabolic000 was saying, though. They were saying that it can be used as a tool for oppression, not that it *is* oppressive. It's social authority figures--the people who make the laws and rules--that make it oppressive by punishing those who choose not to wear it. People are confusing abusive regimes with the religion that these regimes are using as a tool. There's a difference. 

A piece of clothing as a religious symbol is utterly harmless in every way--it's the people who threaten those who do not wear it that are the problem. Muslim women are free to wear or not wear hijabs in many parts of the world, so no, it's not really oppressive."
229,e5x9xd7,"&gt;**&gt; Our infrastructure is poor. Roads are pretty bad in fact when compared to TN .**

Climate is the biggest issue with roads. And also the fact that people won't give up land at all for widening, will use any means of political pressure/influence to halt it , **and then** complain all the time . For example, the worst roads I've seen (lets forget inaccessible Wayanad &amp; Idukki) , are in Kannur district, which has the most 'politically active' people in the state.

&amp;#x200B;

Giving long term (maintenance included)  contracts to private players will help improve quality and accountability,.I will cite the MC road stretch passing from Muvattupuzha onwards to Koothatukulam towards kottayam etc as a great example of a great state road built by private contractors. But as usual mallus will bitch about paying TOLL and politicians like PC will threaten toll operators for applause.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**&gt; Our industries are failing. Communist Govt should do more to lead industries imo.**

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of IT what else is left ?

* Hospitality - Mostly private owned, but corrupt and doing huge damage to ecology. Sustainable tourism will mean govt control and investment, for which we may not have enough funds.
* Medical Tourism - Huge potential, but mostly private players. I do feel , with our govt run Ayurveda/Thirummal hospitals doing rather well, we should've jumped on the med-tourism bandwagon, before these Gulf-mallu  groups established.
* Agriculture - Spices and rubber are reasonably good, but importing foriegn rubber has started fucking over plantation districts . Rice &amp; Veggie cultivation are piss poor, we import most of it. Few companies like Pavizham (in ekm) have started buying out farmland in bulk and cultivating(more output = more profits )  . Hopefully that clicks on and our agri land is saved from being converted .
* Toddy/Pubs  - Great potential to complement tourism, but ***sadacharam*** keeps us from maybe going for a goa like - casual drinking setup
* Even IT isn't growing at a great pace  because  we aren't attracting non mallu professionals. Kerala isn't seen as that 'welcome'  a place for long time stay (as in settling here for IT work ) because of a lot of reasons - ZERO social life (shops close at 9:30, no pubs/dance/social scene, moral policing etc etc.)  There are longstanding  concerns about our 'political culture' - hartals and stuff, which disrupts work.

&gt;**&gt; We went bankrupt recently (Words of Thomas Isaac not mine)**

Nothing to be done  there, unless revenue generating endeavors are created, we will continue depending on Tourism , alcohol tax etc. At some point the ability to fund our welfare systems will cease, and we'll be left behind in the only thing we were leading - HDI .

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**&gt; Better Attitude towards women and lots more.**

&amp;#x200B;

Depends , Xtians are moving forward quite well here, except, occasionally ,  when it comes to defending women against church. They have always led in educating girls and promoting women .  Attitude of hindus is getting reasonably better , especially among lower castes (***who traditionally didn't educate women much***) . More women are being sent for education and away for work. Which will help. **Kudumbashree and similar SHGs has played a huge role**.

&amp;#x200B;

But as a result , they will hold out on marriage a bit more, and will get more choosy - which will mean , **the weaker 'men' wont get brides to satisfy** ***kazhapp*** and more misogyny/assault/abuse could happen, **cyber abuse being the most common outlet.** More muslim women are being sent to school/college  as well (as private institutions have increased) , but a lot of highly arabised institutions are propping up in north kerala  promoting full *sacks* in college and heavy gender segregation etc , which isn't good for 'progress' ."
230,e2bb5m9,"I'm super embarrassed by this, but one day I was walking outside on a windy afternoon and a group of three young ladies in hijabs were walking ahead, coming towards me. These women happened to be in the full regalia: no part of their skin was showing and even their eyes were covered by a thin veil. I had seen this kind of dress before, though, so although it was rare, I was used to it. In that moment I was pondering this, however, a particularly determined gust of wind blew towards them and suddenly, two of them lost their veils and one of them, her entire face covering.

I stopped dead in my tracks.

I'm not even lying, I imagined that God was about to smite me, or that an angry mob of Arabic males might just materialise out of thin air and threaten to stone them.

But despite my obvious staring, the ladies simply reattached/fastened the wraps and kept walking, one of them even giving me a slight smile, the other two barely missing a beat in their conversation.

And it was in that moment I realised, Arab girls are quite pretty."
231,dw76lup,"why threaten?  why not do?  teen talaq is not the only problem.  muslim women are converted into stay at home baby factories.

muslim women should convert to jainism. there is no caste issue and those communities are rich, influential and organised af."
232,dwcyyn9,"&gt;&gt; Better arguments please? There is an enormous inequality between the poor and the rich too. 
&gt;
&gt;As per the constitution - the State cannot discriminate against a citizen on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.
&gt;If the state is allowing a man to have more than one spouse &amp; is not allowing a woman to do the same, then it's a violation of fundamental rights.

Then provide for the same in the Special Marriage Act. Bring in polygyny and polyandry, well polygamy.

&gt;&gt; Ridiculous how?
&gt;
&gt;Ridiculous because most Muslim women are not in a position to renounce Islam like you suggested. Not just that, some mullah may even put a fatwa on them for doing so. Many mullahs believe that renouncing Islam is punishable by execution.  

It's the government's job to put in those mullahs who threaten murder then. Of course the easier path is to ban everything.

&gt;&gt; What inequality? You'll be taking away the freedom of following religion by consenting adults you know.
&gt;
&gt;Freedom to practice a religion doesn't trump fundamental rights. 

How are the rights being violated by getting into a polygynous marriage?

&gt;&gt;  It just has to ensure that basic human rights are not getting violated then it can bypass religion
&gt;
&gt;But it does. 

Does what?


&gt;&gt; Do you disagree with the secularism and that government should on its own whims and fee-fees should interfere in some places and not in others?
&gt;
&gt;Govt is not doing this on their own whims. They are asking the SC court to check if this is unconstitutional or not.   

Supreme Court of course has the finest minds when it declared that Hinduism is a way of life and not a religion."
233,dt5k5jj,"&gt; Ok but a good husband isn’t going to threaten divorce if his wife is not in the mood for Sex.

Source?

I'm sure many men divorced because their wives started getting old and weren't attractive anymore.

&gt; And if a husband gets mad cause his wife isn’t in the mood sometimes then he’s immature and needs to grow up. It’s called maturity and understanding.

Many men are immature(if not straight up abusive). Yet Muslim women are still expected to obey these men.   "
234,fko1grp,"Hi, calm down and let's discuss one issue at a time.

1- We as Muslim follow Prophet Muhamed PBUH

2- His guidance came directly from Quran or Hadith.

3- Throughout our History a lot of Scholars did a fantastic job of validating Hadith and preserving Quran

4- If an issue was clear or doesn't require interpretation then it is fine(That could be classified under the necessity known of the faith like Zakat is an obligation and drinking alcohol is haram.

5- If something is not clear, here comes the scholar, They have the tools of knowing Arbaic of the Time of the prophet, The culture to understand the meaning behind the literal wording etc, and other tools and guidelines like what did the companions did regarding this or that, etc...

6- We had a lot of Sunni Scholars notably 4  who interpreted basically most of the issues you can imagine(Hanbali, Hanafi, Malki and Shafei).. their followers followed their methods of analogy and deducing judgement regarding something.

7- Some issues were not addressed in their times which requires modern scholars, like organ transplant. Coffee for example were forbidden at ottoman times, etc..

&amp;#x200B;

Now, regarding Niqab/Hijab... I'm not deep into the issue, but first what you want as prophet interpretation is an evidence for Niqab, because that what his interpretation was for his wives. Another evidence against its compulsory is in Hajj the women are required to reveal their faces, there are a lot of evidences and hadithes, interpretations by companions,etc,,,

Now you only want the prophet interpretation, Quran only discard Hadith, etc

The problem is all of our knowledge of Quran Hadith, came from the Companions and their followers until today.. this is our source, it is not a simple matter to deduce a judgement on an issue without having a proper knowledge of the tools mentioned above.

Like I said, The scholars agrees it is debatable between (Must and recommendations) but certainly it is not a bad thing to be extra covered as a muslim woman(specially that was the attire of the wives of our prophet).

Let's get to the compliance, First if it is hard for you to comply, that is natural in our days, muslim women are the ones suffers racism the most because they have an obvious identity. and Niqab Bans everywhere including muslim countries.

You can acknowledge your weakness of adherence and asks Allah for help to be the best you could. Not ideal but certainly denying something that has all the evidence in Islam can bring you to a bad zone of rejection of part of the faith(which is dangerous).

Now about forcing wives and sisters, this is another matter....and issue, Is it the right for a father or a husband to order his wife/daughter from the first place? Is this something good or bad? Suppose that is their right, Is this the most wise path or can it backfire? All of this are different questions with different issues,independent from the original question: Is Niqab part of the Faith? Is it Fard(compulsory) (Recommended)(permissible)(Not Recommended)(Or Haram)

Sorry, But the truth defies simplicity. We tend to forget that but the literal meaning of Islam is surrendering everything to Allah, every aspect of your life including things that you might hate, because he is our creator and knows the best for us.

Again I'm not a scholar and cannot get into a deep discussion of the case of Niqab.. if you want strong evidence, then I'm not the right person. Just if it turns out to be true for you, accept it and pray for guidance and help for adherence.

May Allah guide you and all of us."
235,fkob2mz,"As an ex muslim and having lived in areas of the UK where largely Muslim immigrants are settled, it's very easy to understand why anyone would be apprehensive of having more of them around.

The overwhelming majority of them simply take it for granted that muslims are better than everyone else and non muslims, especially non muslim women are little better off than animals. The irritating thing is that the irony of the fact that they're in the UK because it offers a higher standard of life than their muslim countries if origin simply doesn't register with these people.

In Birmingham, when the child sex grooming nonsense was first beginning to come to public attention, 80% of the imams who were approached by the government to denounce the practice refused to do so.  

I actually had to leave Birmingham because being an ex muslim in some parts of the UK is gradually getting to be almost as dangerous as being an ex muslim in Pakistan or Bangladesh! That's not an exaggeration. And given their high rates of reproduction, a demographic shift is simply a matter of time. And muslims are already beginning to impose a kind of Sharia law in the West. I don't know if you've heard of the European Court's ruling that calling muhammad a pedophile is not free speech? The more muslims there are in Europe, the more you can expect that type of lunacy to grow.

That's why I have absolutely NOTHING against imposing a ban on immigration from muslim countries so that the West doesn't lose its character as a secular society."
236,fmt219j,"&gt; You didn't read my point where I stated they all wouldn't be. A patriarchy isn't just supported by men, but by women who grew up in that patriarchy and would of course support it or otherwise they wouldn't succesful. Not everyone wants equal freedoms and women who enjoy theirs roles in patriarchal sociaties find themselves happy.

I would like to address the strange paradoxical nature of this, because if they truly feel troubled with their position in society then they would naturally rebel and change society. However as shown muslim women are completely content with their place in a society which is portrayed by the west as 'male dominated', which means that:

If there is an issue with society then people will try and fix it when they have the means. In this situation, we have outside characters who see a society as inherently sexist, but the men and women in said society don't see it as so. If women in a patriarchal society are for the most part happy then is there something truly wrong with that society? After all what really matters is that people in said society are content with their way of life, and that what they're doing isn't completely borderline dangerous to health or society itself. 

People act in a society for their own regards to their welfare, not to what outsiders think. Perhaps some of it has to be dealt from their pov and not yours, or for a lack of a better word, one needs to see this from an eastern standpoint than a western one. Because I've talked to women who grew up in the east and they say that their culture is completely fine (but they also admit sexism exists but is bearable), and then contrasted it with completely westernized women who think it's horrible in the east in every aspect imaginable. Who's right then?

Last point, in a patriarchal society it's not men oppressing women are 'innocent and helpless', it's men and women who believe that said system is correct. A more violent example would be something like FGM (and tbh it doesn't happen in the ME that much), its not just men who say that it's right, it's also women who believe that it's correct. When you see a picture of it happening, you're seeing a child who thinks it's right but is still pained, and a man and woman who both believe that it's the right thing."
237,fhy1ell,"maybe if the practice was somethint much more inherently dangerous, wherein being forced to take part in it could ruin your life (or end it), i would support maybe banning, and even that not a hundred percent, only if it wss favourable by the numbers. i dont again agree with forcing the burqa on anyone, but its not really life threatening or anything, and you can get out of it if you want to (i see alot of my classmates wear it leaving the house and take it off right after, maybe you guys shouldn't assume all muslim women are timid, dependant losers who cant prioritise whats important for them and whats not and make a choice based on that)"
238,fj6fty0,"
&gt;Not necessarily. From his point of view, he's merely educating the newcomer on the past.

Education on history is good. But explaining like for example, that certain Kings who used to expand their territory to well get more territories and power did it to wreck terror and evil around the land, and is ordered by the said King's religion. And how that religion came to that, and how the people need to be very cautious around them…

I actually don't think I was clear with that. What I meant was a leader from a group called A, tells about how group (B) came to their land through evil and violent ways and how they are taught by that in their religion and how they will use their chance at A when they get it and so on.

&gt;Respect is a hierarchy.

Respect is more given. He won't really be ruling around his people. But they will come to him, as they believe he is wise or shown enough instaces of being wise and so got respected for it.

Like I respect you for being kind here. : )

&gt;I don't have a problem with advicing; my only problem is that the criteria for advicing is based on religious prejudices. You may not advise people on their clothing but it's not forbidden by your religion. A group of people aggressively ganging up and advising can be considered bullying.

Even I have a problem with people ganging up and aggressively 'advising' them. Keeping modesty is important, but how much covered is one to be modest is debated. But the thing that is clear and even before the modesty of a women's dressing, is man to lower his glance. That is not to stare. 

Also, since we're on this, I don't like people keep saying that Muslim women are forced to wear Hijab, they wear it because of their beliefs and devotion. There are those who don't, but they all feel that even the most famous and independent women are 'forced' to wear it. Just wanted to say that.

&gt;Actually no.

Um, I don't know about that lol. But I'm more talking about 
[I'm more talking about things like this articles says](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/oct/07/ottoman-empire-secular-history-sharia) [And this article too](And https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/898733)

&gt;Which leads to internalized guilt among queer muslims. And do you think it's a sin?

I'll be honest. I don't know. From the naration of Lot's(pbuh) story, the town what I get is, was filled with rapists. I see both Muslims and Christians arguing that the wrong they might have been doing was rape than homosexuality.

But only the belief in another god makes a person a non Muslim. It's also need to be noted that, any kind of sin is repentable, from doing actions to prayers. I would like to study about my religion more, from the history of the people and it's influence today. But regardless, Muslims should simply stay away from what they know as sins, and not mess or hurt others doing it(unless it's something dangerous like murder and so). So, I don't want anyone to be hurt just because of the way they choose to be. That's not what my religion teaches.


By the US, formerly and to a large extent even today. Religion is one aspect but the main reason is that it's contrary to american philosophy.

And didn't wars happen because of that? Like the Vietnam war and so on? I think.

&gt;But that would be random incidents not targeted harassment of a specific group.

Yes, but damage is still damage. 

&gt;I was ok in school; then in college I met conservative muslims from north who basically refuse to even be present at functions when we light a nilavilakk. And they shamed less conservative muslims from their area who weren't so extremist.

Ah, I guess that's because some believe it's worship and all. I don't, I feel it only depends if we actually do consider it as worship. Afterall, belief is in our hearts, not in what we do. I'm from the North too(Or did you mean North India?), and we kind of celebrate Onam and Christmas, and recently holi (not me, I just don't like getting colours inside my eyes as well in my dress). Though I guess you would know about the belief system of Muslims. Complete monotheism to the one God. No worship or prayer to anything other than God, and that includes not just other religions, but also people, and even things, like money and so on. It's in the sense that people also worship materiel stuff too. And so I mean, Muslims, like I, only believe in and worship to God. 

&gt;You don't need to thank me for not being a bigot. That should be the default expectations.

Haha, I guess that's how we all should be. Thanks anyways.

But what do you think I was? Was I clear in what I was trying to say? Was this too mean or 'preachy', do you think I can improve on somewhere in how I respond?"
239,fctzl09,"&gt;society needs to stop viewing men as inherently dangerous and have empathy for them instead. 

Let's take Muslims as an example. Muslim men commit far more crime than white men in Europe, which is why it's suggested that Muslim immigration be limited. If  we deluded ourselves into believing that women and men are equal when it comes to crime, pretending that Muslim women are also the ones grooming children and gang-raping men, then they'd be banned too. Except that reality is far from that case. Believing men aren't disproportionately more likely to commit crime hurts women. 

The solution is to segregate men and women, dismantling the ""society"" (50% men, 50% women)
and have men deal with their issues by changing themselves."
240,f9sk58c,"My understanding is that this is a case of intentions. These young women who choose to wear niqab aren’t doing it to be more “godly” or remove themselves from the secular world the way I think a Christian fundie might say. Rather it is an intentionally political act performed by a marginalized minority group (many from colonized countries) in a society that already views us as “other” and demands assimilation and conformity and the erasure of visible signs of our “Muslim-ness.” White christian girls in long skirts might get snarked on on reddit, but wearing hijab in some parts of the western world is literally dangerous and/or illegal—so no, I don’t think it can be considered entirely similar. Additionally, it’s a call out to the kind of western feminism that either excludes Muslim women’s voices and experiences entirely or infantilizes us as victims needing to be freed, which entirely discounts the fact that Muslim women are on the front lines of fighting for our own equal rights on our own terms, including efforts to control the complex and complicated discourse surrounding hijab in our own communities and patriarchal cultural traditions concerning female autonomy."
241,f3a8lb1,"Even if this is a true story. That's still a dangerous as fuck game. Cause if you fuck them, they probably get killed (sent back to home country) by their family behind closed doors.

Muslim women are as hot as any other woman, but their religion means that promiscuity will 99% spell their demise."
242,f1ahiot,Yeah but Islam doesn’t let women vote. Islamic women are more dangerous because they are breeding farms for literal and cultural invaders and become subservient to their sons assuring their true misogyny.
243,exch5q4,"There are a few things I agree with and others I disagree with in the post and thread. Firstly, things I take issues with:

&gt;*I think Islam would be weakened if people were encouraged to be more  proud of their specific nationalities or ethnicities and their  associated cultures, as opposed to being proud about being Muslim.*  

I know it may seem as a rather laughable idea in the contemporary world where Islam is presented as the *most immoral and decadent* religious system but what made Islam especially troublesome was its adaptability. I believe Graham E. Fuller brings this forth in his book, *A World Without Islam*. Islamic morality and Quranic interpretation is malleable enough that Islam was absorbed within various cultures in varying forms. Even the process of Salah differs from culture to region. Similarly, Islamic law or *fiqh* sees equal variation, from cruelly stringent to absurdly liberal depending on interpretation, as we examine different scholars of different regions and cultures. Islamic morality is not a byproduct of Islam. It is a consequence of culture. Various non-Muslim scholars such as Esposito and Fuller who have studied Islamic history agree with the conclusion. Thus patriotic love is not compromised with religious. I also take issue with the idea of *weakening* Islam for it suggests that *Islam* is some form of antagonistic force that requires weakening for the betterment of the world. I am sincerely less afraid of religion in contrast to nationalism and populism which unnerves me. Thus the idea of replacing religious devotion with patriotism is just opening a different can of worms. 

&gt;*This is why nationalism needs to replace Islamic identity. Secular  Western values simply can't compete with the pride of the Muslim. We  need something that appeals to Muslims' fundamental sense of, and desire  for, greatness. Only nationalism can do this.* 

Nationalism is terrifying. It is the most primal basis of tribal perceptions of *in-groups* and *out-groups* save for physical features. I also take issue with this seemingly uniquely *Muslim* sentiment for greatness and superiority. Furthermore, this anti-theistic perception of secularism is quite dangerous as well. Secularism does not equate to anti-religion. Rather, it is an acknowledgement of every religion and their fundamental right to exist in harmony, prohibiting bias at an institutional level. I would much rather Muslim women keep wearing Hijabs than have their sentiments replaced by... nationalism of all things. And pride in something as malleable, abstract and varying as religious precepts is slightly more preferable than nationalism which intrinsically divisive.

&gt;*I have other concerns beyond the particular advancement of Muslim women.*

And this is ultimately where the conundrum lies. These expressed sentiments take not root within legitimate feminist concerns. Rather, it is a fear of Islam or *political Islam* (whatever that implies). The girls I am familiar with wish to be treated as humans despite their differing ideology. I do not find it more harmful than men who wish to harm them and rip their scarves of their scalps under the guise of *liberality*. The *Hijab* for the girls I am familiar with represents a... pride in a faith system which has been slandered, vilified, and *otherized*, presented as a demonic faith than one of harmony as it is for us. I may not agree with their means yet I hold reverence for their choice of expression. Now, for the things I (slightly) agree with:

&gt;*the hijab is not for most women primarily a display of theological adherence.* 

It is, of course, not that black and white. It is an amalgamation of both religious devotion yet expression of heritage. I can't help but compare their circumstances with aboriginal children who seek their traditions and cultures, attempting to reclaim them and remove this view of savagery from them. Yet, they still legitimately love the traditional garbs for it is but an extension of their person.

&gt;*Haddad states that post 9/11 some Muslim women took off the veil to avoid persecution,whereas others insisted on wearing it to show that they were followers of Islam and were not afraid to be seen as such, and even despite harassment these women continued to wear it. The evidence from her research also shows that since 9/11, the mosques in the U.S.A. and women’s groups have become more popular with Muslim women and have become a place where women can meet to share ideas and discuss their everyday lives. Haddad concludes by showing that Muslim women are becoming increasingly important in ‘altering public prejudice against Islam and Muslims’.*   
*Khan’s research shows that the wearing of the hijab was for the majority of those interviewed an ‘Assertion of Islamic Identity’ and that most of the women wearing the hijab were the first in their household to do so. Khan explains that many of these women had opposition from their family to their wearing of the hijab, due to fears for their safety, even though the women expressed a positive reaction from the public and felt that they had ‘Greater freedom in public (“Liberating”)’ when they wore it.*  

[This source](https://derby.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10545/306736/Muslim%20women%20%26%20hijab.pdf?sequence=4&amp;isAllowed=y) goes into more detail on the various forces in play and ideological basis for adorning the Hijab. While I hold a great dislike for the *Hijab* itself and the faulty narratives which have normalized it, including outright fabricated theological texts as seen in *Tafseer-ibn-Katheer* and false historicity, I do feel this great reverence for [rebellious](https://www.npr.org/2018/04/16/602850226/bullied-for-their-faith-muslim-family-fights-back-through-education) girls who resist anti-Islamic sentiments in the face of growing nationalism in the West which view Islam as uniquely foreign and its followers as dangerous. It is quite strange that even though the *Hijab* has been existent within the West for quite some time at this point, it is still seen as a *foreign* cloth. It suggests an non-secular bias against one form of religious expression. And frankly, for the girls I am familiar with, their ability to adorn the *Hijab* in a country such as Canada makes them more patriotic for it shows an acknowledgement of their humanity and an acceptance for their choice. Their patriotism is not compromised by their *Hijab*. Rather, it is strengthened. For these girls, it is an expression of an antagonized, dehumanized, tortured identity over some nationalistic nostalgia for some distant moral system. The mechanisms of radicalization are quite contrasting from the mechanisms which dictate the choice to adorn the *Hijab*. Frankly, you're conflating the Amina Wadduds of this world with the Farhat Hashmis. [Being expressive in your identity does not equate to an absence of patriotism and love for one's country.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/16/religion.uk)"
244,exqebqk,"I understand your point and I dont want to delegitimize what Nadia as a character may mean to you. But I also can't overlook that Nadia's story does reinforce harmful Islamophobic stereotypes, especially in how the biggest source of problems in her life is her strict overreligious father. 

You mentioned how early in the season Nadia has to deal with being stereotypes as oppressed, which is true and I thought was an interesting angle. But the show drops that angle when it reveals that oh, she really is oppressed and needs to be liberated. And the show positions Guzman, a character who was almost willing to sexually assault Nadia to win a challenge, as her savior

I don't think you can disentangle her individual story from the trope it perpetuates that Muslim women are constantly abused and controlled by the men in their lives. And that narrative is regularly applied to Muslims in real life. It was even presented as a justification for the US to invade Afghanistan, these narratives are genuinely dangerous for Muslims. 

I think there are better ways to portray the conflict Muslim women face in reconciling their identities, I'm a big fan of the recent Ms. Marvel comics for this very reason. But those comics are written by a Muslim and you see that in the way they respect and value Islam and Kamala's parents, rather than constantly framing them as something to be overcome"
245,exyyiv6,"I see three large problems with that, sadly.

Muslim women are forbidden from marrying non-Muslims. Defying this could be dangerous. That said, if the man can pretend to be Muslim it might work (as long as it's clear he won't actually convert!)

Some Muslim women have their marriages arranged for them - to very religious Muslims, and it can again be dangerous to defy the parents.

It means the marriage is for convenience rather than love - not a big deal this one, admittedly."
246,eykd7s9,"I would also like to see examples of this. In my experience, Western feminists generally do not want to see women being told what to wear (be that whether they *must* wear a hijab or they *can't* wear a hijab). Western feminists also do not like to see Muslim women become the target of bigotry or discrimination, and a lot of people who pretend to care about the rights of Muslim women are actually just interested in demonizing Islam. 

As a Western feminist myself, I dislike the disproportionate emphasis on the hijab. All women do/wear shit to comply with the patriarchy because it's exhausting, scary, and sometimes dangerous to oppose it. I hate shaving my legs and I only do it out of social coercion. But I don't see a bunch of men telling me that I need to stop shaving my legs since it's not my free choice. Blathering on about the hijab is cherry-picking with an anti-Islam agenda. Orthodox Jewish women also cover their hair but nobody freaks out about that."
247,etf3bct,"""—and what may look like liberation for wealthy white women may be counterproductive for poor Black women or trans women or Latina women""

That sentence in itself shows how reactionary and dangerous the ideology of intersectionality can become. It sees progress as a zero sum game. 
Then it creates a ranking of oppression and concludes that some groups are more worthy of liberation than other groups (Black women/white women).

In relation to Islam, for example, it claims that universal liberation movements such as feminist movement is racist because it doesn't accommodate patriarchal traditions of Islam that Muslim women are more comfortable with.

Intersectionality is dangerous because it hits at the heart of the main humanistic theories that have been sustaining our society and tries to subvert them.

There is nothing in female liberation that is counterproductive to non-white women. The same with LGBT movement.

Any society progresses from bottom up. Solving  your patriarchy and homophobia is always a productive thing to do. That should be done first, no matter the color of your skin."
248,etmdn85,"Tommy Robinson is coke-fuelled moron. However, he doesn't even pretend to be primarily concerned with paedophiles, and the muslim rape gangs he spends a lot of time talking about aren't actually paedophiles either. He's not pretending to be some sort of anti-paedophile vigilante. Such people do exist, but Robinson isn't one of them and has never claimed to be.

Tommy Robinson is a critic of Islamic ideology. He's critical of many different aspects of it, this is just one example. And it is a particularly pertinent example, because these gangs have got away with what they've done for far too long precisely because the authorities and media are scared of being accused of ""Islamophobia"" if they do anything about it. 

As for the gang members themselves, research suggested that rather than being genuine paedophiles (ie people sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children) they chose their victims because they were vulnerable, and because they were low-status, especially from an Islamic point of view (they were non-muslim, non-asian and ""not the property"" of any males). The fact that many of them were technically below the age of consent was a side-effect of the fact that younger girls are more naive, vulnerable and easily manipulated/co-erced. The were easy prey. It is also a reflection of the contempt these individuals have for British law - which is again a symptom of Islam ideology. In their culture, the laws which really matter are Islamic laws, and under Islamic law, single non-muslim women are kuffar trash.

Tommy Robinson is dangerous. That is why he needs to be taken seriously, and not straw-manned."
249,elm1wjy,"Again, let me preface by saying that Muslim women are not strawmen. But here we go:

[A Muslim Woman's organization dedicated solely to correcting misinterpreted laws](http://www.sistersinislam.org.my/)

[The cultural status of women in Islam](https://www.whyislam.org/islam/statusofwomen/)

[Contrary to conservative belief, Muslims forbid rape. It's literally punishable by death.](https://www.learnreligions.com/what-does-islamic-law-say-about-rape-2004208)

[There is an ongoing and active fight for women's equality in Egypt.](https://www.usaid.gov/egypt/gender-equality-and-womens-empowerment)

[A Muslim woman founded one of the first universities ever.](https://www.whyislam.org/muslim-heritage/fatima-al-fihri-founder-of-worlds-very-first-university/)

[Islam commands equal education of men and women.](https://www.whyislam.org/social-ties-2/the-importance-of-girls-education-in-islam/)

[Women have the right to work in Islam, and are not required to share their earnings with anyone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i__FaWRT4bc)

Now, you'll notice that these are founded in Islamic beliefs, not in the countries themselves. There is a massive issue of women's rights in typically *third world countries*, not only the Middle East, where people (and especially women) might be illiterate, or cultural biases limit the openness of rulings that strongly benefit women.

Like I said in an earlier comment, cultural bias is a predominant reason why Islam is muddled. Islam came in an era of especially dangerous misogyny in the Middle East, where femicide was very normal. When wars were waged and these countries became majority Muslim, their cultures didn't leave, despite their new religion - they became a part of the local version of Islam. This has become a problem within the Muslim community."
250,elofshn,"The point is, that despite the fact that she technically can wear whatever she wants, actually doing that would be a death wish.

She will lose support of a lot of her friends, maybe even family.

Muslim women are heavily oppressed and indoctrinated to accept said oppression with open arms.

The idea that we shouldn't talk about these issues is a very dangerous one as it is allowing this to go on."
251,eiarhjc,"Yet in Indonesia religious men were going around attacking Muslim girls and women for not wearing a hijab till they all started wearing it to keep from being attacked. Something similar happened in Iraq after the US invasion until even Christian women started wearing the hijab because it was dangerous not to wear one. In all these cases it was forced, and forced on all women. Some women think by wearing a hijab Muslim women are endangering the freedom of all women.

&gt;I realized how common it had become only in mid-July when M., a childhood friend, came to say goodbye before leaving the country. She walked into the house, complaining of the heat and the roads, her brother following closely behind. It took me to the end of the visit for the peculiarity of the situation to hit me. She was getting ready to leave before the sun set, and she picked up the beige headscarf folded neatly by her side. As she told me about one of her neighbors being shot, she opened up the scarf with a flourish, set it on her head like a pro, and pinned it snuggly under her chin with the precision of a seasoned hijab-wearer. All this without a mirror- like she had done it a hundred times over... Which would be fine, except that M. is Christian. http://www.321gold.com/editorials/riverbend/080506.html"
252,eipxs9o,"The old testament has no place in modern society, Christianity was reformed, almost every religion has been reformed and evolved over time, Islam has not.  It's like every religion except for Islam has said ""We're wrong, we should change"" meanwhile Islam is like ""Nope, we're perfect, we don't have to change"" it's 2019 and Muslims are still practicing slavery, hundreds of Muslim women are child brides &amp; have had their genitals mutilated, they're killing people for drawing Muhammad, killing gays, killing apostates, forcing women to dress with veils, forcing women to have chaperones, forcing Islamic education in schools while ignoring actual science, murdering each other etc.  Like what exactly attracts you to this religion?  They're exactly like those hardcore Christians you hate but x10.  

This guy said he wasn't right or left wing.  Islam isn't a race either, it's an ideology and a very dangerous, barbaric religion, one that has been dragging down humanity for thousands of years.  Islam produces stupidity, a victim mentality, a hateful mentality.  That's reflected in all Islamic countries.  "
253,eflf00b,"You are flat out wrong.

First of all, FGM is far more painful. And those who do it are a tiny number of women. The vast majority of Muslim women are not subject to FGM. FGM basically prevents women from having enjoyable sex while that is absolutely not true for men. Trying to compare the two is downright dangerous and ignorant. "
254,efx5hwi,"You're starting to sound a lot like a child just calling me names and claiming I'm putting words in your mouth without providing examples. I have plenty of decency thanks. 

""It doesn't change the fact that many Muslim women are fearful to remove it and this solves that"". But by doing this you're restricting the freedoms of people who wish to wear it, out of their own commitment to their faith. You're also ignoring my point that taking the hijab away won't stop the abuse it just shifts to something different, therefore banning the hijab is fruitless because it's attacking another religion and other peoples freedom and it doesn't address the issue at heart which is what they should be ""energy into fighting"" rather than an all-out ban. 

What do you define as majority integration? obviously, we want to abide by our laws and share similar values, but when you say ""fully integrate immigrants with western values and secularism"" you're acting like Islam is cannot work under a more modern government? 

 ""I didn't say policy dictated culture"" When did I say it did? How did I manipulate what you said? ""Also yes bans and policies certainly do change the culture and dramatically so"" Policy is dictation, culture is fluid and therefore subverts and reacts to policy attempting to dictate culture.   


""like you said they drive it to the fri he and that has had enormous impact on the culture."" So we can agree that by banning something that people will practice anyway will just make it more dangerous for these women that are within the Muslim community because it will push Islam and forcing hijabs on women to the fringes. 

I do agree that abuse is objectively wrong. Anyone sane knows that. I'm simply saying that suggesting we're objectively right just because we're the dominant, just because we're the West is a flawed argument.  I'm with you on the whole trump analogy I'm just pointing out the fact that you used us being The West as a reason for us being ethically superior."
255,ea01ys5,"Yes, because empowering Muslim women to be active in their country and their communities is beneficial for them whether or not you agree with their hijab. Muslim women becoming elected officials is a good thing. Muslim women attending higher education is a good thing. Muslim women playing sport is a good thing. This is in fact especially true if you believe Islam is dangerous to women- then you should agree that Muslim women being afforded the chance to be independent and see the world is a good thing. The idea that open expressions of the Muslim faith are bad for society or should not be allowed (eg hijab bans) only push Muslim women further from freedom and keep them more cloistered in their home than some might argue they already are.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention, Muslim women are oppressed in an intersectional way that white women are not; them being oppressed by patriarchy in their homes is not erased by the constant negativity and violence towards Muslims from white supremacists. Islamophobic violence and hate crimes do not discriminate between male oppressors and female victims, and in fact women are more likely to be the victim of an Islamophobic hate crime because, if the wear hijab, their Muslim status is more visible. Muslim women cannot and shouldn't have to choice between whether they want liberation based on their sex or their religion. Both are essential. Even if all of the patriarchal elements of Islam disappeared overnight, Muslim women would still be put at risk by the overwhelmingly negative sentiments towards Islam in the west.

&amp;#x200B;

ETA, as feminists we should know better than to ask ""why are they making such a big deal about Islam? Why can't it be religious freedom for all?"" Umm, that's EXACTLY the same logic as ""why do we need feminism? Why not just equality? Men have issues too."" Regardless of the problematic elements of its doctrines, Muslims are indisputably an oppressed group in the west today, and need the same type of ""extra"" support that other oppressed groups like women do. Muslim women especially need this support, being that they are oppressed on both axes."
256,e7x9fah,"WOW. Just, wow - where on earth did you get the idea that **literally** *nobody* wore the hijab before 1970!? Even *if* somehow you held such an erroneous understanding of history, a simple Google search would clarify your understanding - if you wished for clarity.  

Muslims have been wearing the hijab since the time of the Prophet Muhammad. Covering &amp; dressing modestly is not unique to Islam either - it was practised in Christians (who oppresses nuns to cover? Is it more male oppression again? Who oppressed the mother of Jesus to cover?), and amongst Jews. Jewish women to this day cover their hair - Orthodox Jewish women, although in that typically Jewish style of 'outsmarting' God/The Law, they use wigs to cover their hair... Ever seen old black &amp; white pictures of American women wearing bonnets? Victorian head coverings?  

You don't have to explain anything to me - the only person you have to answer to is yourself, and if you are a believer, to God on the Day of Judgement. You and you alone, will answer to God and account for your deeds, as will I. If you choose to be a Muslim, then you owe it to yourself to understand what exactly it is that you are committing yourself to.  

And by the way, in case it's not clear, this isn't a binary situation: you *can* be a Muslim and not wear the hijab. Just as one can be a Muslim and also drink beer. Or be a Muslim and sleep around. Or be a Muslim and be a thief (pretty much any leader of a Muslim country falls into this category...). However, there is something which one must be *very* careful of:  

Yeah, you can drink (alcohol) and be a Muslim - a sinful one obviously. But if a Muslim were to claim that there is no prohibition on intoxicants in Islam, they would no longer be a Muslim. Why? Because they are taking it upon themselves to make what is haram halal. No one has the authority to do so.  

For a Muslim - someone who claims to submit to the will of God - when God and His Messenger have made a decree on a matter, that is the end of it.  

So again for hijab - Muslim women are free to obey the command of God and His Messenger to cover or not, as they wish. *But* any one who claims that hijab is *not* required in Islam is venturing into very, *very* dangerous waters indeed. The former group are merely sinners, whereas the latter have a committed a sin of a far greater magnitude and may have left the faith entirely."
257,e3wugdt,"Because that's not the same. Muslim women are not regarded as equal to Muslim men and the headscarf is a symbol of that oppression. They're being made to cover up because they think men can't control themselves around uncovered women which is frankly a dangerous attitude to have. 

I'm modest. I don't wear revealing clothing outside. Covering your hair and sometimes face is not modesty, it's dehumanising. 

"
258,e1bo620,"It's wrong to think that women do not defend the hijab as much as men, though. Muslim women are some of the strongest firebrands in the entire religion, and often times in the West they're the ones at the forefront of Islamization. It's very dangerous for people to see the women as prisoners savage men waiting to be free, it does not explain how deeply this religion goes and how adamant its followers are. I find Muslims take advantage of the fact that Westerners see their women as docile slaves to allow the women to emotionally manipulate them on the public stage. "
259,e01d4f6,"&gt;The divisive and repugnant London Mayoral campaign run by the Tory nominee Zac Goldsmith against Labour’s Muslim candidate, Sadiq Khan, was making me sick to my stomach. 

so, people didn't support sadiq, ok?

&gt;This campaign was Islamophobic. How else could one explain the campaign literature declaring: “His party supports a wealth tax on family jewellery...  As a government minister he did not use his position to speak about Sri Lanka or the Tamil community.” Words like ""radical"" and ""dangerous"" were used – words easily associated with terror and extremism. 

The fact that the only term you say is ""How else do you explain it"" means that perhaps you don't realise some people didn't like him for other reasons? and how the fuck are 'dangerous' and 'radical' words that cannot be used and are automatically associated with Islamophobia?

&gt;The implication, being, of course, that Muslim women are all oppressed little meek creatures seeking our fathers or husband’s permission to do anything.

Women are known for being oppressed in Islamic countries.

&gt;The Conservative Party and many within it seem to have a notion that Islam is not compatible with British values

Gee, its almost as if people who have a completely different mindset on morals to our own, things like forcing women to marry, slaughtering 'unbelievers' and making women second class citizens, isn't compatible with British culture.



"
260,dxpbgpa,"&gt; But the issue still lies with how we would empirically implement rules across different groups once we acknowledged that they were different. That seems like it would be really ugly really fast. Say we adopt a legal definition of Asian Americans that includes them being of higher average IQ, and furthermore we note that to do nothing is to ensure inequality. What rules could we change that wouldn't inherently create groups that are privileged/handicapped due to race or ethnicity?

I really don't think there is a good answer to this, I certainly don't have one anyway. But I think we need to remember racism can and is happening on both sides of this conversation. Nazi Germany is the perfect example of how a society can just as easily discriminate against a group of people for being ""superior"".

If there are groups who will always naturally fall to the top or bottom of the social-economic ladder then we have to decide whether we either want to accept that, or whether we'd prefer to treat people unequally in an attempt to overcome some of the natural advantages / disadvantages some groups might have.

I'm pretty libertarian minded so the idea of trying to force some kind of social equality based on genetics really bothers me. It's why I am very much opposed to the ""progressive"" type of sexual and racial discrimination we implement today. I'm personally okay with women earning less than men, or Asians and Jews earning more than whites (like myself). I rather not go down the ""too many Jews in positions of power"" route in the name of equality, although worryingly we seem fine as a society saying ""too many white men in positions of power"" today. 

If there is no right answer, I think our best option is simply to  acknowledge life isn't fair. In my opinion the only solution is to to create more homogeneous societies, but that's easier said than done. I don't know where you're from, but in the UK I really don't think we've done ourselves any favours by having so many different communities living so extremely differently to each other. Large inequalities are arising here from the extreme cultural divides of multiculturalism alone. One example is that Muslim women are much less likely to work for example, so Muslim children are almost certainly not going to be raised with the same financial security that white children are. Then when you compare that to the work ethic of some East Asians it's just obvious Asians are going to be over represented in academia regardless of genetic differences.

As for racial differences, I don't have a good answer. I think having a reasonable rate of immigration is one obvious answer though. Racial issues that have long been part of American history are now popping up all over Europe where previously they never existed. I think the UK would benefit just letting people mix for a few generations so these differences aren't quite as obvious. I'm ethnically mixed, but I see myself completely as British. If I was low IQ and struggling in life I wouldn't be able to say it's because of racism because I see myself as British. But something I've noticed is that people born in the UK who are for example 100% ethnicity Indian will see themselves as Indian not British. This isn't ideal because that allows them to group themselves differently and in turn more likely question whether their individual circumstances are what they are because they are part of that group.

I think while we say we like diversity, human history would suggest we probably don't. Perhaps we have learnt our lesson and this time it will be okay, but I honestly think we play a dangerous game with human nature in our current multi-cultural / multi-ethnic societies. You just have to look how divided we are politically and socially by race to see how this isn't a healthy situation we find ourselves in today. I guess the good news is in time with globalisation the genetic diversity between population should hopefully start to disappear, but in the mean time if these differences are real and significant enough in our societies perhaps it's just inevitable that the far-right will exist and continue to suggest we discriminant against minorities, while the far-left will continue to suggest we discriminant against those who naturally rise to the top.if these differences are real and significant enough in our societies perhaps it's just inevitable that the far-right will exist and continue to suggest we discriminant against minorities, while the far-left will continue to suggest we discriminant against those who naturally rise to the top."
261,dvimcht,"I agree! This is such a horrible development. Is feminism finally coming to destroy the Islamic world?

&gt;But the protestors marching to the parliament building in Tunis on Saturday said they wanted to be compared with European women and to be entitled to the same inheritance rights.

&gt;Joined by some men, they carried slogans such as “In a civil state I take exactly what you take”, demanding an end to inheritance laws based on Islamic law. This usually grants men the double of what women get.

From this, we can see that they are only concerned with *taking* - not with producing or earning equal status - and being like European women, whom they perceive as being able to take more.

Men work more often, harder, and in more dangerous positions! Men have more responsibilities! Now even other Muslim women are starting to forget this?! I wonder at how it could come to pass. How is it that our countries continually absorb only the absolute worst from the West and never the best attributes? Why do we lack the geniuses and innovators, but become enthralled by alcoholism, degeneracy, and social disorder? Silly ideas like ""women should receive what men receive, but without contributing what men contribute"" are taking hold, but not ""I want men to conform to my expectations, so I should conform to his as well"".

It is discomforting that now hundreds of people think this one-sided ""equality"" is good, acceptable, or sustainable, but even more so when you consider that they angrily shouted these things in public and demanded the government make their ideas national law."

263,do6yu5a,"I did once support freedom of choice for the burqa and hijab, but I'm not so supportive of the clothing anymore. We assume that other world culture will want to assimilate to our own, but that's really a dangerous assumption. In France, liberty means freedom FROM religion, not OF it.  Their symbol of liberty is a woman, Marianne, in the revolution's most famous painting: she's holding the French flag, her dress dropped, revealing both breasts. Nudity in France IS French culture. If they want to protect that idea by banning the burqa, fine. So be it. Bottom line is that Muslim women are subjugated, and make the choice or are forced to make the choice by fellow Muslims to wear the garments. They can't don their real hair in front of men to whom they're not related. The moment a male visitor comes into their house, they have to return to their bedroom to put the clothing back on. Muslim women wear garments to keep Muslim men from getting erections. Literally. I would hope that Muslim males would develop their own male civility so females won't have to be holy for them to keep the Muslim men pure and worthy of Allah. It's the dark ages."
264,dobv4nw,"&gt; So if one board uses pepe memes more than others its now ""theirs"" and therefor, racist?

You realize that just because a character has become a racist/fascist icon doesn't mean all incarnations of it are racist/fascist, right? This is why the author is trying to reclaim it.

&gt;Nobody documents the usage of ""memes.""

Of course they do.

&gt;Don't move goal posts, I'm talking about existing ones to use to communicate with.

I'm not moving the goalposts, I'm explaining how your analogy could work, and why it doesn't the way it's presented.

&gt;""censor themselves"" You mean say someone is ""hateful/racist"" in a politically charged climate and pin where they live.

I have no idea what you're trying to say here.

&gt;Your attempt to downplay is very disingenuous.

I'm not downplaying it, I'm saying the SPLC isn't responsible for the attacks.

&gt;Having a different opinion in regards to traditions that's contrary to LGBT lifestyles isn't ""hate.""

It's hate when you try to legislate to take away their rights.

&gt;The irony here is SPLC sticks up for islam that is vehemently anti-LGBT.

It doesn't ""stick up for Islam"", it denounced Islamophobia. Those are two different things. Christianity is vehemently anti-LGBTQ as well, that doesn't make it okay to be a bigot towards Christians.

&gt;What if you were against something that someone else did because it hurts others and the SPLC labeled you as a hate speaker?

Except that's not what happened, as I already argued.

&gt;Antifa know where you live and where you look and now you have to spend time fighting against defamation while worrying about if someone is going to throw a Molotov through your window.

Except that wouldn't happen because I'm not a hate group. Furthermore, if antifa were to attack, it would *still* not be the responsibility of the SPLC.

&gt;Obviously over the top but SPLC is not perfect

I never said they were, but them not being perfect wasn't your initial charge.

&gt;Obviously over the top but SPLC is not perfect, they'll label someone like Ben Shapiro as a hate speaker when he is to the contrary.

I disagree. Ben Shapiro *is* a hate speaker. He's also a climate change denier, and Islamophobe.

No.

You don't know what I know about Islam or not, and the fact that she is Somali is immaterial. You can decry FGM without being anti-Islam. Most Muslim women are not victims of FGM.

&gt;It's not bigotry when you don't want to be a second rate citizen anymore, haha oh wow dude.

It is bigotry if you attack the religion as a whole instead of the conservative clerics who are keeping many Muslims in the Dark Ages.

That's not what I'm doing, so that point is moot.

Islam isn't a hateful religion. Some Muslims are hateful, just like some Christians are hateful. Attack the individuals spreading fundamentalist interpretation of religions, not religions themselves.

265,dmalvhx,"&gt;Muslim women get it double and even triple

Since Muslim women are most often women of color they face that as well
Then like all women they face beauty standards that often makes them feel she is not good enough and then add in the obvious problem of ageism which has problems more so for women

&gt;I agree. We put Muslim women on such a ridiculous scale expecting them to be the very personification of Islam. While non Muslim men see Muslim women as weak women that need to be beaten or liberated, Muslim men see them as property and an extension of their own honor. If men could practice Islam as much as they forced it on women or if they talked about womens' rights as much as they slammed feminism, this would be a better world.

&gt;I've seen girls harassed for not wearing the hijab ""perfectly"" so much that they just give up altogether.
People harass hijabis that wear makeup or turban-style scarves all the time but never say anything about men that wear skinny jeans or smoke shisha every night. I don't know why there's such a double standard but it's extremely discouraging for younger women that are just starting to wear hijab or are feeling insecure about it.

267,djop30h,"&gt;no one practices Islam the way it was practiced 1400 years ago, because times have changed.
What makes you think that? Have you ever stepped foot on, known someone from, or even researched about majority Muslim countries? Like Indonesia, Chechnya, Egypt, etc? In Indonesia the muslims actually got a governor candidate thrown in jail because he made one little not so nice comment about the Koran. 

The Koran doesn't have every single islamic law it only has the basics. Anything outside of the Koran are just ""hadeeths"" and open to change. The problem is that the koran has some dangerous things that not only can not be changed, but if a muslim questions it, they are considered a nonbeliever. 

The bible has been changed multiple times and it will continue to change

Please also understand that when Im attacking islam Im not attacking muslims, or any race, or culture. In facts muslims (especially muslim women) are the worst victims of Islam. Culture and religion are different. Two people of different religion can share the same culture and two people of different cultures can share the same religion. I love all people from around the 
world and I expose myself to different cultures and ways of life (I actually attended some breakfasts this past Ramadan), I am however not willing to close my thinking cap for the sake of political correctness. "
268,dh09bf6,"Here's an example highlighting your point:

Assuming that every woman who wears a hijab is ""oppressed"" into doing so is like assuming that every man who wears a turban is ""oppressed"" into doing so. 

But the reality is that the same people who think every hijab is a case of religious oppression, generally look at turbans as symbols of religious *expression.* There are plenty of religions which mandate that *both* men and women cover their heads/hair before God. Judaism for example. I'm pretty sure that the same cultural/social/religious pressures are affected upon those men who don't wear turbans in Sikh society for example, yet we reasonably assume that for the majority of turban wearers it is a willing decision to wear that turban as part of their religious beliefs. We reasonably assume that kippa/yarmulka that many Jewish men wear isn't exactly oppression. Likewise it should be safe to assume that many Muslim women who wear hijabs do so willingly, and so we probably shouldn't freak out every time we see a girl wearing a hijab in the West.

Unless we're talking about people living in extreme societies wherein it's illegal or dangerous not to wear religious headgear, we shouldn't automatically assume that all religious headgear is oppressive. Unless a hijab wearer somehow makes it clear that they're only wearing it because of the risk of repercussions from their family and community, then we shouldn't get up in arms. Muslim women are just as likely to want to adhere to their faith as anyone else, and that can include things like hijabs. "
269,dh5fhbj,"&gt; Perhaps most famous for this video:

&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp8tToFv-bA

So I started watching it, and I definitely have some problems already with it.  Disclaimer: as I write this I haven't finished it, maybe she'll address some of these issues, I'll edit and make a note if she does.

She claims that male disposability is descended from the necessity of tribal cultures to preserve the ability to produce offspring effectively, which would require many women and few males.  But that's...a pretty specious argument that lacks any substance.  She doesn't back that up with anything, she just states it with confidence.  On the surface, sure, I'll accept that, but you can't ignore chivalry culture and the existence of benevolent sexism.  That is: women must be protected because they are too weak and frail to protect themselves.  It is right and good that a man should die to protect his woman because she is his responsibility - there is no room for her to take responsibility for herself in this system.

The overall discussion is about the definition of ""feminism"" and ""feminists"" so I don't want to get bogged down in that right here.  Without delving into that, the ""feminist"" argument is that you destroy the concept of the disposable male when you give women more agency over themselves because you remove the need to protect them.  Men don't have to die for women when we *allow* them the opportunity to die for themselves.

It's the same argument that (predominantly male) people make when they say that women should be more forward about seeking a relationship with men, that it shouldn't always be up to the man to make the first move and initiate the relationship.  To which feminists respond: ok, so stop demonizing female sexuality and teaching women that to desire sex makes them slutty and undesirable, and then they'll be more willing and able to initiate the relationship.  Similarly, feminism detests the ""disposable male"" because the idea is rooted in removing agency from women.  Just like Muslim women are told to wear the scarf to protect them from the evil gazes of men; just like the argument that denying women the right to vote protects them from the stress of politics.  This is one particular moment when the overzealous protection of women from themselves actually *benefited* women and, by and large, feminists are perfectly willing to dispose of the idea.

To justify keeping women as possessions safely locked up at home, you must rationalize that they are too weak to protect themselves and too untrustworthy to be left alone.  The antithesis is that men must be capable of protecting them: to be kept, women must be weak.  If women are weak, men must be strong.  If someone is weak, they are not a man.  ""It doesn't make sense that men would willingly throw themselves to die if they're treating women as property!""  It does when you stop and think about the fact that normally property isn't capable of 1) defending itself, or 2) defending you.  Consider the American Civil War: were the slaves armed and sent into battle by the Confederacy?  Of course not - that would mean arming them, giving them the autonomy required for war, and trusting them to use it on someone else.  You're literally giving them a degree of power and that's dangerous.  It wasn't until the end of the war, when they were desperate for soldiers that they considered arming slaves.

It should be obvious from historical events what happens when you give autonomy and power to a subjugated group.  [Rosie the Riveter](http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2014/02/We-Can-Do-It-Rosie-the-Riveter-Wallpaper-2-AB.jpeg) is a feminist icon and she started as WWII propaganda just to get women to help with the war effort.  Suddenly, women found themselves *capable* of doing the labor that was denied them and didn't want to give that up.  Women were given an opportunity to participate meaningfully with industry and it spawned another wave of feminism because they didn't want to go back to being bored housewives, barefoot and pregnant.  So why is it that men are willing to throw themselves into death to protect the women?  Because it is absolutely vital for the existing power dynamic to do so.  Doing so tells women that their value is directly tied to their ability to produce and raise children and for literally nothing else.  Allowing women the opportunity to decide their own fate in a crisis means inviting them to actively participate in the decision-making of society (however brief the decisions may be as everyone dies).  [How well will that translate beyond the immediate crisis?](https://image.spreadshirtmedia.com/image-server/v1/compositions/1007794984/views/1,width=800,height=800,appearanceId=2,version=1442425209/rosie-riveter-feminist-women-s-hoodie.jpg)  So yes, *of course* men are going to throw themselves into death.

That doesn't mean each individual man consciously thought to himself, *Gee I'd better go die or else the systemic control men have over women might be weakened at some nebulous time in the future...*  But it's equally vapid to suggest that each individual man consciously thought to himself, *Gee wouldn't it be grand to be objectified to the degree that I was locked in a room instead of on a battlefield...*

Anyway, I'm going to finish watching this video.

EDIT: it annoys me that she keeps saying ""Women **and children** first"".  Seriously, can you not see the relevance that you're lumping women *and children* in the same category while complaining that men throw themselves into danger?  Women *and children* as if both of those groups of people are equally capable of sacrificing themselves for others...

EDIT: ""You're teaching her that she's inherently valuable...""  You're also teaching her that she's incapable of managing her own emotions because she's too weak to do so, that she is always a slave to them; unlike her brother, who should behave like a normal, strong, rational man.  She mentions often that situations are more complex than feminists think they are *while simultaneously making reductionist arguments about those situations*.  This is very frustrating."
270,dhcesat,"Okay, now that’s out of the way, time to address what you’ve thrown in front of me.

&gt;What is stopping subtle racial or socioeconomic discrimination? Because legal action is so costly and timely, it doesn't begin to be a realistic approach for about anyone who does not have a great deal of money. About two years ago, I got fired when it came to light I was out at my job due to some comments about my personal life I made to my coworker. I live in a right-to-work state so they don't have to offer any reason for my firing. I filed a report with the local LGBTQ Equality center, who tells me this is a common practice for this local company, but there is nothing I can do about it because of how strenuous legal action would be---with little chance of success.

Well, once again, you have my sympathy. 

Admittedly, it is difficult to change attitudes to issues like LGBT rights, but what you’re asking of me is a singular solution that does not exist – issues like racial and socioeconomic discrimination are nuanced and complex in the extreme. If anything, escaping victimology seems like the most viable way forward for minority groups. Oftentimes, these people portray themselves as victims of society, helpless to save themselves, in the process demanding the world change by pushing unreasonable demands such as increasingly imbalanced diversity quotas.

Simply powering through the odds using internal support structures and networks might work – a good example of this is women’s involvement in industry during WW2 becoming a significant factor not only in the increasing emancipation of women, but also in securing their right to vote. It proves that the group in concern is more than just a bunch of whining children.

&gt;But that's a gross misunderstanding and simplification---I addressed and refuted your sources, which were fundamentally flawed and acknowledged by many other journalists as being flawed and misleading.

You did not refute my sources, because what you cited either supported my viewpoint or was insubstantial.

&gt;TL;DR (which by the way, is massively insulting and something I never did to you): pay gaps are a mixture of paleo-sexism, unconscious sexism, and double standards.

Like I said, I was short on time. You chose to interpret it as me brushing away your opinion, whereas it was really just a quick summarisation because 1. my phone is shit and was lagging with the long comments and 2. I do have other things to do.

Once again, proving stereotypes wrong is far, far more effective than campaigning about them without adjusting your own behaviour otherwise. Also, you are suggesting that a 24% reduction in labour costs is worth less than working with only men, which is absurd given the huge numbers that especially large companies deal with – within the EU-28, [labour costs on average accounted for 23.9% of business expenditure]( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Wages_and_labour_costs#Labour_costs). This works out to a roughly 6% decrease in budget, which is ridiculous when these institutions are dealing with millions of dollars; to put that in perspective, a typical healthy operating profit margin is ~25%.

The monetary incentive far, far outweighs the social one.

&gt;But you are aware that SJW is a term used by the right to describe anybody who is socially leftist, yes?

SJW is the term used to describe someone who is part of the social justice movement. You can be socially left without identifying with values typically seen in social justice culture.

&gt;Then you should be aware of multiple things, the first being that casual malingering is pretty damn rare.

Sure. But the effect it has thanks to the vocal individuals who engage in this behaviour is certainly anything but insignificant.

Because it is drilled into your head that anybody could be ‘triggered’ by your use of language, you end up with ridiculous concepts such as jazz hands/snapping fingers, removal of material from college courses that could potentially be ‘triggering’ (especially literature), language policing on an unimaginable scale, [you get the gist]( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/05/trigger-warnings-can-be-counterproductive). The problem I have is that people who pull this stuff have an irresistible urge to change the world around them, and they often succeed, often to the detriment of people simply trying to get on with life.

&gt;Really? Because Trump's victory terrifies me, when it's acknowledged that he's endorsed by actual Neo Nazis and David Duke (and refuses to denounce them) and that he assaults women but that doesn't stop people from voting for him? That terrifies me and emboldens violence against people like me (speaking from experience. People's antisemitism and misogyny has become much more open since he's won).

Well, first of all, the sexual harassment thing is a quote that’s been taken out of context. If people actually bothered to take a look, he says something akin to, “you can do anything with that much money… you could go up to women and grab them by the pussy”. It’s a declaration of his own power, not an admission that he sexually harasses women.

Anyway, Founding Fathers and separation of powers 101: the President’s power is severely limited. People are all fucking terrified of him when in reality, he can’t pull off all the stuff that he intends to, because American government is separated into three branches that perform checks and balances on each other. While how effective this system is in regulating presidential power is debatable, I’d recommend reading up on it more.

Furthermore, instead of providing a stable and reasonable counter-argument to supporters of Mr. Wall-builder, the left insisted on ostracizing Trump supporters, calling them bigots and racists, beating them in the streets, attempting to disrupt their rallies – doing this only solidifies their beliefs. I should be worried, but it’s kinda cancelled out by the fact that the left was asking for this to happen.

&gt;Where on earth is your evidence for this?

[Couldn’t link it because my phone is shit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv8H7_K9qtM)

&gt;Additionally, my point was that your first article, WHICH YOU LINKED AND INSINUATED AGREEMENT was about how Arabic women are all oppressed, and then followed it with a link from an actual Arabic women telling people who aren't Arabic women to not talk about this.

&gt;DO YOU SEE YOUR OWN HYPOCRISY?

The article I linked is written by the CEO of Arab Council Australia. As she writes it, she shows little, if any, regard for what’s actually going on in the Middle East. She says this, quoting it as an example of ‘absolute rhetoric’ by extension implying it has no validity: “Arab or Muslim women are oppressed and subservient to men. Or that Arab and Muslim girls are forced into early marriages.”

This is not the case.  The Middle East experiences [startlingly high levels of rape and sexual violence]( http://www.themedialine.org/featured/rates-rape-sexual-violence-high-middle-east/) with IPV being as high as 40%, and [early marriage](http://www.girlsnotbrides.org/region/middle-east-and-north-africa/) is also disgustingly prevalent.

My point was that these individuals stigmatize dialogue that would be genuinely useful – and here is a privileged woman in the West doing exactly that. By attempting to separate the association between poor women’s rights and the Middle East, she is actively hurting women’s rights activism in those areas.

This is not hypocrisy; this is you failing to understand my point.

&gt;So you admit that you are only for your own confirmation bias, because as I said, Lacee Green isn't associated with the left, but with American libertarians (right, center-right).

&gt;Also, your discussion of ""real victims"" is ironic since it sounds exactly like Lacee Green as well as Republicans who doubt rape victims and say shit like ""legitimate rape.""

I fail to see how this has any association to political orientation. Laci Green remains one of the most subscribed to SJWs on the Internet iirc, and just because she doesn’t necessarily get associated with the left doesn’t mean that she isn’t an SJW, and it doesn’t mean that SJWs don’t listen to her intently and agree with her.

And that is an incredibly inaccurate generalisation to make. 

Almost dangerous.

I am in full support of those who experience significant trauma, and condemn those who attempt to imitate victims in an attempt to earn social brownie points and to forward their own agendas. Laci supports victims that endorse her political agenda, and condemns those who don’t.

One of these is reasonable, and the other is an obnoxious mask of deceit and lack of empathy.

Don’t confuse the two.

In this response, you have decided to be personal and invidious without enough support to back it up, so I think you need to reconsider your approach. You failed to properly read almost everything you sent me as ‘evidence’, you failed to properly read any of my arguments, and you proceeded to engage in highly charged outbursts that were not conducive to discussion.

If you’re going to be impolite in a discussion, at the very least, make sure you’re flawless in your execution.

271,dhzq2mo,"Let me get this straight:

1. You say that none of the violence is happening.

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6czkwo/pol_anon_isis_in_capturedcity_marawi_philippines/?ref=search_posts

You are completely wrong, there are people dying and routinely being asked to recite the Shahada and if not able to they are killed, women without Hijabs are getting ripped off the streets and killed. 

2. You say Muslims would not do such violence to other Muslims.

Do you have any idea who the Muslims throughout history have been fighting against? Other Muslims!!!! Sure they have a world wide caliphate, but let's not let that blind us... Muslim women are the worst treated women in the world, who enforces the zero rights they have? Muslim men and husbands. If you are saying there is no violence right now but even if there is they wouldn't do that to Muslims anyway, you are backtracking and endorsing violence by ignoring and lying about it.

3. You say Muate is not ISIS but they sympathize and are trying to get noticed.

You are seriously nitpicking the fact that these people are only under a teeny tiny little group that isn't ISIS even thought every single barbaric thing happening is textbook ISIS, trying to get noticed by the main terror group doesn't make you less dangerous...

4. You say showing and grouping them as and with ISIS I am inherently puting people in danger of dying because of validation.

Actually sharing information and images of what these barbaric losers are doing gives only the victims validation, you think sawing threw someone's neck isn't validating that they are winning? You think the opinions of people let alone on a comment section of Reddit have any weight with ISIS or their constituents?? You are promoting terror by hiding from it and shilling. 
Funny your account is 9 days old and the past few days have been nothing but shilling in the r/Philippines comments.

272,efx39iz,"Holy shit, when you pretend I've said things that I haven't to enhance an argument, that just makes you a straight up liar and it's super aggravating. Have some decency. 

That's great that you've identified a deeper rooted issue, now if you care you'd put energy into fighting rather than this. It doesn't change the fact that many Muslim women are fearful to remove it and this solves that. 

I didn't say they were all fearful did I liar. No I'm saying they're brainwashed as if we haven't been convinced that exposing the female head makes God hate you. 

Yes, again of course it doesn't remove abuse and the fear, it does however remove the fear of abuse specifically for removing it. It's that specific fear that encourages many to keep it on against their own will. 

Full integration is not impossible, you can accomplish majority integration in the first generation like most Europeans after WWII and fully in their generations after. If they really want to live here (which most do) then they can achieve integration of the things that matter like western values, at very least learn it and act it. That doesn't mean they need to change diet, faith, dance, etc.  

I didn't say policy dictated culture, I said it influenced it as it is in turn influenced by it, again this is you pretending I've said something I haven't and it makes me feel like I'm talking to a manipulator. Opioids are highly addictive and deadly period, the combination of harsh punishment, lack of rehab support, and medical opioid enabling policies is the reason we are in this crises, like you said they drive it to the fri he and that has had enormous impact on the culture. Same for alcohol. 

Well if you consider the West's position on women abuse to only be subjectively true then I don't particularly care for your opinion on how to deal with it. Now see something like abortion is truly subjective because of legitimate arguments on both sides but if you don't see this subject as one being objectively right and the other wrong as far as ethics go, then again I don't care to hear that. It's like a Trump supporter describing how they think trickle economics works when you know that studies have unanimously shown the contrary, or the same for climate change being natural, except the question is about oppression of women being arguably okay.

273,dl395uu,"As someone coming from a religious Muslim family as well I need to say one or two things. 

Women wearing hijabs don't make them religious freaks, that's condescending and it's kind of showing you have no respect for your mother for what she believes in so just because she has a nice ass you're into her? Kind of objectifying, please find someone else to live your sexual desires out with, a woman you don't think of as a freak maybe. 

And secondly, if your mother wears a hijab because she seriously believes she needs to wear one for religious reasons and not because she grew up in a society that just saw a hijab in a traditional way then you will freak her out for the rest of her life. No way would she be cool doing anything sexual with you. In religious terms this is probably a deadly sin and Muslims take these things more seriously than probably members of any other religion. I know a lot of conservative Christian people but a lot of them still have premarital sex whereas religious Muslims usually don't. 

And thirdly, I find it hard to believe that she wouldn't know what a boner is. Maybe she had no sex education and isn't having sex right now or for the past ten years but she's most definitely not a virgin and probably knows why men get boners. 

That being said, I was just seriously bothered by OP calling Hijabis freaks. My mother wears one too and it's just the way she lives out her religious beliefs. And I wanted to offer advice because knowing how religious Muslim women are I don't think this is something his mother would ever approve of.

As for everyone else in this subreddit, I don't have anything against your fantasies or your relationships. I'm following this subreddit more out of interest because I like reading about people with different life stories. It's more interesting than stereotypical people whose life is just like everyone else's. At first I have to admit I was a bit appalled when hearing that people have relationships with their siblings or parents but now I'm thinking ""as long as both are consenting, legal and are cautious, who I am to judge them?"" 

I only meant to point this out because religion is a factor to take into account and I don't think truly religious Muslims would be okay with practicing incest. And as much as OP calling his mother a freak bothered me, I wouldn't want their relationship to be damaged which I think would happen if he ever tried something. "
274,fz31gz2,"Who decides which cultural norms shouldn't go away, and which ones should, though? I think it's up to the practitioners of the cultural norms, rather than people who don't participate. 

There's a scary double standard for religious headwear in America, where nuns aren't harassed for their religious beliefs, but Muslim women are. Most of the people who hate on hijabs aren't Muslim, and they don't consider that it's just as much of a choice in America as being a Christian nun is. 

While I agree that legal mandates about what women can and cannot wear are oppressive, when it's a personal choice that isn't coerced, I can't stand by and allow people to attack others freedom of religion and expression."

I'm a 29 y/o woman in the USA, and *terrified* of bugs. I accidentally injured myself last month after trying to get away from a bug touching my leg (see more on r/TIFU). Since then, just the idea of another bug touching me makes my skin crawl. I can't go outside in my summer clothes without worrying about any insect touching me, even one that's harmless. Not even coating myself in bug spray can keep me from feeling like I'm gonna have a panic attack. 

One thing that has helped my fear of bugs is covering myself up when I go outside; a hat, long sleeves, and pants. Since I live in the Midwest and it's the dead of summer, I'd wait until sunset to go out for a walk, when it's relatively cooler out. Other than that, I've been really reluctant to spend too long outside before I'd either get overheated from wearing long-sleeves in the summer, or relive the horrors of my July injuries all over again.

Speaking of summer, I often visit my family in the countryside, and one thing they like to do is go swimming in a river near a campsite (we're allowed to do it.) I've been reluctant to join them due to my fear of bugs, but I've been exploring my options on bathing suits that cover more of your body than your traditional one-piece or bikini. Then, I remembered one garment that combined the traditional Muslim burka/burqa with a bikini to make a swimsuit called a ""Burkini."" It basically works like a tightly-fitted body suit with a hood that covers your head, but shows your face. However, I'm also fully aware of the religious aspects behind burka, and the stigma from wearing one since so many Muslim women are forced to cover against their will. Part of me thinks it's not only inappropriate to wear attire from a religion I don't follow (I'm agnostic,) but also one that's often a sign of oppression toward women (a debate for another subreddit.) However, another side of me thinks I might just be overthinking it, and most people won't make the connection if I laze around on the river wearing one. I just want to handle my phobia; I don't want anyone to think I'm being oppressed. I could just try to find one of those full-body swimsuits, and get one of those rubber swim caps for my hair; a burkini just seems to combine the functions of both.

&gt;European countries are not oppressing anyone

You're destroying the world, however.

 
&gt;What Europeans want isn't problematic. 

It is. Because none of the problems you think you face exist.

&gt;We simply want to preserve our cultures and ethnicities. 

That is not a problem when Muslim women enter your countries.

&gt;We don't have to open up our borders to people who are not culturally compatible, 

Muslim women are not going to be utilitarian when they have no reason to. Their values are shaped by their environment. They aren't going to change them unless or until they leave said environment. I simply falter to see why it's so difficult for your brain to absorb.


&gt;and you haven't yet made a valid argument for why we should.

Our survival. The fact that we live in patriarchal countries. Next.

&gt;But we're not talking about you holding onto your culture in Pakistan where its unsafe for you to leave it behind. 


So you know I live in Pakistan. Why didnt you process the fact that I was atheistic?

&gt;We are talking about you holding onto it in Europe. You agreed that muslim men should not be allowed to move to Europe, so let's say, hypothetically, that you moved to Europe alone (no father, no brother, etc). What would your excuse be for still holding onto islam? What abuse and torture would you have to suffer from if muslim men wouldn't even exist in Europe? Your argument doesn't make sense. 

Yeah, about that, I would....... *literally leave Islam in such an environment?*

?

Most women would.


&gt;Itsounds like typical muslim excuses and taqiyyah. 

*Taqiyyah....* God... What's the point of arguing with you?

&gt;Just admit that you don't want to leave your religion behind. There's absolutely no valid reason why you would still practice it in a new country away from abusive muslim men.

It's not my fucking religion lol.

&gt;Not an argument

Seems like you cannot counter it.

&gt;Lies. When did I tell you how you should or shouldn't feel? In fact, I specified that I understand how you feel in my last post. But just because I understand how you feel, and think you have a right to feel that way, doesn't mean you have a right to act on your emotions in a country that isn't yours.

My point was simple: Your feelings are no reason to interfere with other's lives. 

Im not being snarky here, but Maybe you missed it? I fail to see how this section of the comment is relevant.

&gt;Not an argument. I already acknowledged myself that it's rare. But rare occasions are still occasions.

Nobody has a reason to fret over anamolies. Much less make any *indirect* factors illegal.

&gt;And I shouldn't have to. It's not about it being hard. It's about you being a pest to your host country by refusing to integrate.

Not about integration, though.

If anything, you should mask yourself too. Deepfake pornography is increasing in Europe, right?

&gt;I never said men can be RadFems. I said ""RadFem Male Allies"" i.e. males that are allies to RadFems. Yes, they do exist. Check out r/GenderCriticalGuys and r/MensLib. There are plenty of male allies on those subs. I've spoken to many myself.

Isn't it abundantly clear to you that a significant portion of both subs are filled with women?

Nonetheless, are you satisfied with them? Do they agree with everything radfems concern themselves about?

&gt;Who said that that the overwhelming majority of men agreed that pornography is bad? I never did. I said it's possible for men to accept feminism while rejecting islam. I never said the majority of men in the present moment accept feminism.

It's not feminism vs Islam. It's feminists vs Muslim women. Why would they accept feminists over Muslim women being against the same thing? Why wouldn't they just deport Muslim women, regardless of whether they're doing it for feminism or Islam, purely out of disagreement?

&gt;....And here is where your taqiyyah is showing. You're referring back to the argument where you said you can help spread feminism and get rid of porn culture with islam. But didn't you just say that the reason women won't leave islam behind is because they fear abuse and torture from men? So which one is it? Women are too afraid to leave islam, or women are using islam to fight misogyny? What is your real reason for wanting to stay muslim?

&gt;Again, I don't care if islam can help fight porn culture. Islam doesn't oppose porn from a feminist perspective. It opposes porn because it's sinful and considered degenerate. Even if islam were able to fully eliminate porn from Europe, I would still oppose it because how would it do it? At what expense? Surely that would only happen through shariah law and I don't fucking want shariah law in Europe. It's now obvious that you're a muslim extremist who wants to spread islam in Europe under the guise that it would eliminate porn and help the feminist cause. Your veil is off now. Stop hiding. Admit your true intentions.

I did not fake months of critiquing Islam through my post history in order to convince some stranger on the internet that I'm actually atheistic. Come on now.

&gt;Per capita, Saudi Arabia produces the most CO2 emissions in the world.

It will reap what it sows.

&gt;South Korea and Japan also produce more CO2 emissions per capita than any European nation.

Sure. They're horrible too. 

&gt;However, per capita doesn't really matter here 

**Why not?**

&gt;because China and India's CO2 emissions have the greatest effect on climate change.

So? They have the largest population on Earth. I rather that if you combine all countries of Europe into one and check out it's annual emmisions, it would blow the two out of the water.

&gt;So it's ridiculous that you let them off the hook.

But honestly... both of them suck.

&gt;You should attack them for the same reasons you are attacking Europeans. 

I probably would if I spoke chinese or could type in Hindi lol. 

&gt;So, tell me, why don't you move to China instead? Northern China is cold and perfectly inhabitable. But you somehow feel entitled to moving to Europe of all places. Why? Give me a valid reason because I already debunked your climate change one.

I'll probably go there or heck even stay here. What about other women though?

&gt;Not an argument. I can choose to spend my time however I please. 

Why? It's helping no one.

&gt;Besides, I do rally against corporations releasing CO2 into the air. I actually care deeply about the planet. 

Admirable."
277,fwljfos,"I apologise. I deleted my response as I wrote it in haste. I was not trying to be shady, most of what I wrote is still. In my second comment but reconfigured. 

And forgive me for making it a perisnal attack on you. It was not my intention to get perisnal and at the same time people who are against feminism do feel like a perisnal attack to me. This isn't just some bstract concept in my life, this is my every day. I have not only lived in the west, I have also lived back home. These groups you call poison have meant the difference between me being able to do simple things like keep a job or get a credit card or run in a marathon. These are all things women were banned from doing even in the west up until the 70s and the feminist movement.

Again. I'm sure you've done lots of wonderful things for women and I shouldn't have assumed you are the same as the other men from our community who poo poo feminism. I am repeatedly frustrated at the men in our community who do nothing for women but complain about feminism and I lumped you in with them. 

I responded as though it's a personal attack for me because as I say, it is personal. Muslim women are attacked everyday just for being women. Everyday your humanity is in question, even in your own home. Please accept my Apologies for personally attacking you and I hope you understand me.

278,fr2a0ac,"Absolutely fantastic! Dont mind me OP if I were to share one of my thoughts. Just a few days back r/historyporn had an image of women in Iran protesting against the mandatory wearing of the Hijab and the comments there was spectacular. Knowing fully well that there is hardly much muslim presence on reddit, let alone muslim women, Redditors after Redditors commented on how feminism was enabling the subjugation of muslim women by not saying anything about the Hijab, essentially supporting it, and that all, if not most Muslim women are forced to wear it. Im confident that most of those comments were written by men, mostly white and most definitely has never ever interected with muslims, let alone muslim women. As an ex-muslim, I have to say that this pretence i see on reddit that Redditors 'care' about muslim women is beyond hilarious. They dont, and in fact want to impose their own values on them without fpr one second asking them what they want. I know countless women who wear it because they want to. This is such a frustrating issue for me, especially seeing as muslim women face more islamaphobia and are visibly noticeable. We are pretending to speak on behalf of an already marginalized group by not giving them an opportunity to speak for themselves. This all just to attack feminism which the average Redditor thinks is like some sort of a global conspiracy. Muslim women can decide and speak for themselves reddit. Just because they are not here to do that doesnt mean they dont in their everyday life. Rant over."

For hundreds of years non-muslims have been brutally oppressed in Muslim Countries, 54% of Hindus in Pakistan are bonded labourers, non-Muslim women are abducted almost daily and converted and raped, a more recent eg recent eg, 3 infants burned alive in Pakistan because they were Hindus, it is a law to grant citizenship to people like them.

282,fbcjtj5,"It's late and I'm tired so this will be messy and my english is shit, but:

Don't speak over our experiences

Don't use the ""I have a muslim friend who's doing fine so you must be lying"" argument

Please recognize and keep in mind that MANY muslim women are for the oppressive and misogynistic side of the islamic culture for many reasons, or they simply choose to ignore them but decide to attack whoever speaks against the misogyny in islam, so when they say that islam is feminist and is not oppressive that's bullshit. They also use the ""I'm muslim I know better"" argument to shut down any criticism, and they attack

The honor killings problem is much bigger than western media and feminist communities like to pretend. At least from my point of view since my family threarens me with it, but I know many girls who are under the same threats, and are often threatened to be beaten up for being ""immoral"". I live in the west.

About personal experience...
I grew up in the west since I was 10 years old. I was never forced to wear hijab, but I had a lot of pressure to wear it. When I was 6 or 7, I've been told that if I don't wear hijab, I will burn eternally in hell. My skin and flesh will burn and then be restored, so I will keep suffering eternally. I was terrified. I hated my body,I hated that I was born a woman seeing the total freedom males had, I thought my body is dirty, I was ashamed. I hated when I hit puberty and my body started changing.

 They constantly controlled how I dressed,no makeup, no heels, tights clothes, they controlled my phone, where I go,everything. Once I just put on some new clothes and let my hair down, my mother took me by my hair and hit me against the wall several times screaming ""are you going to school to study or attract men?!"" They're obsessed with everything like that. 

Men of my family have total control over me. If they decide I can't move to another city to study then I have no right to object, that's what happened.
I was physically assaulted by them just because of a rumour I was dating a non muslim. My mother supported what they did.
Dating is out of question. I can't go live alone, they say it's striclty forbidden,so I won't be ""corrupted""they need to control me.
I feel like an object. I can't make choices over my life, where and how I live. I can't choose my religion. I can't choose how I date, I can't even stay out long even if I'm an adult already, they control everything. And if I disobey I'll be physically hurt or even killed.

From inside the community, men have total control over women. I know a woman who was beaten up by her husbands just because she got pregnant with  a girl. Another who lost her child while pregnant because her husband beated her after she spoke too nicely with a stranger. These assholes constantly bring up how it's encouraged for men to be jealous and controlling over women in Islam, and it's true. The community gave no shit. But when it's a woman doing something as simple as wearing what she wants, they are all ready to jump at her throat.

There is so much to say. I can't explain even a little part of it enough. It's a completely another world. I feel so jealous of non muslim girls here because they have so much freedom and I'm just living my life as a rug under my community's and family feet. If you a have question I'll try to answer."
283,f8ux8ib,"I can understand your point and it is a very compassionate one. However, I think it overlooks two important points I am sure you would be willing to consider too: 1.) the sociology; and 2.) the ethics and rhetorical utility of ridicule in a free society.

First, although it is tempting to imagine that all Muslim women are blamelessly passive and oppressed this overlooks the sociology and the measure of agency niqab wearers are often extremely forthright in telling us they have. For example, the women of Islamic State charged with policing female Muslim dress in the caliphate volunteered to be the people that walked around looking for women who they could catch out showing some skin by oversight, and inflicting a combination of jail-time and horrible physical punishments on the victims. For that matter, I personally politely and respectfully interview all of the niqab wearing women I encounter in circumstances that permit a conversation, and every one of them has informed me that they are fully personally invested in both their dress and the religious supremacism it facilitates. This kind of adversarial sociology has its problems, but it is not impossible and there are social facts involved. These social facts do not line up with the total passivity your thesis requires.

Secondly, ridicule serves a useful purpose in or society. While all manner of physical and verbal attacks on people for immutable personal characteristics ranging from skin color to sexual orientation are rightly understood to be racist, sexist and homophobic attacks from physical assault right up through micro-aggression, religious dress is not an immutable characteristic. Although it is possible that there are women in Western society who are for all intents and purposes forced to wear the niqab -- who truly do have no agency to attack -- as my above point suggests, this is clearly not universally true. We then find ourselves wondering if the utility of joking about niqab wearing women is good or bad, depending on the extent to which women who are forced to wear the niqab are harmed or helped and women who want to wear it are harmed or helped. Given that r/exmuslim is filled with stories of hijabi women who no longer believe in God and are very excited for head scarf bans, because it gives them a reason to escape the family rules, it is likely that the effects of Johnsons' joke are more complicated than you imagine.

On the whole, thinking more seriously about all of this is essential."
284,fahxymi,"To give something about your second point, it was not coincidence that every Abrahamic religion developed a culture where woman would dress chaste. Heck, the only difference between our and muslim women is that muslim women are required by the book, to wear like they wear and they are required to cover their faces when in public. Christian women were covering their faces with veils, at least when in churches back in the day. Today's feminist dogma could hardly accept this kinda culture today, because in some weird way, woman's body and beauty = her personality and worth. In fact it is only natural for women to cover their body, because men are almost exclusively visually aroused, while women are not so. It's human biology, and simple mechanic to avoid sexual desire to constantly kick our minds is for women to cover their bodies. 
(I must also say that, in the past, men would relieve themselves with whores, and whores were much more common than today. One can almost say that porn stars took all the jobs for them with all this new technology. But not so many people were taking their time with whores, it was always loathing in society, and not every Catholic went to heaven, don't give yourself that illusion either. We   catholics are not seldom attacked on grounds of evil men which were nominally catholic. We all constantly fight battle with some demon, and we are not perfect. Ultimate fall is when we stop trying, remember that!) 


After that point I'll give you one from my very own experience: i was into body building, and I tell you man, no matter how strong your libido is, you are simply less sexualy active when you spend so much energy building muscles. I also tried working physically 10hours a day, and not only that you have no time to, you have no energy. But most importantly of all, you don't think about it like at all, especially if you don't see beautiful women around you and when you actually try to abdicate from porn. 

Habit is a bitch and if you constantly do something you will always remind yourself of it, but that can be solved with just a bit discipline. 

Next thing, I was for the long time researching psychology of masturbation with my friend, and we pretty much found ""a cure"", if you can call it that. The biggest, biggest thing that compel madturbation is boredom. Boredom itself and very boring jobs also. I am compelled to think that masturbation is product of sloth, not lust, because work truly heals a man. You need to find some work mate, put your mind on something. You won't think of it. But as it is a case with every young man and boy today, our minds are damaged with porn. We are simply ""trained"" to think about it. We think and are very confident in thinking that it's normal. NO IT'S NOT NORMAL! Porn took it's toll. I'm not so good in english so I can't just explain this fast, and I don't have time. If you are interested for more, message me, be free. 

I can say that, at this point, you are where we all have been. Masturbation is your addiction, you can't simply stop in a day. Try to stop porn at first. That will also be tough, but if you relieve yourself without porn everytime you come to that point where you simply cannot think about anything else at all, it will be easier. 

So, first step is to relieve yourself only at great crysis but without porn. I know that many fellow catholic will attack me for this method but you gotta stop some way, and I think it's not so much a sin if it cripples you to do your homework, but it's great sin not to try at all.
Next step is some way train yourself to supress everyday casual thoughts about it, and that's where prayer kicks in. You don't need to stop everything you do and pray like in church, you can simply call for God's help in that moment, and sole reminder of God will help in switching your thoughts. You can also remind yourself in moments of attack, to do something that will really occupy xour mind. Videogames are good if you don't have any real work to do. 
Next will be to try to fight the crysis itself when it comes. Goal is to resist at least that day. You will be suprised that tomorrow crysis might even not appear. But if it do, fight another battle. This is done with pure power of will, but power of will is oftentimes very weak. The one thing that will help train it is sport, especially if you are trying to do something that require intense muscle work, like bodybuilding. That works for me, you might find something else to train your will, or you are already willful enough. You will see that resisting masturbation is faaar more easy when you abdicate porn for a month and managed to ""stay clean"" for a week a couple of times.

At the end, the difference in your life are going to be occasional wet dreams and much more healthier view of women. And when speaking purely for myself, you could also feel more manly, however contradictory that might sound. 

I must also say to you one more thing: I am not the one that got fully rid of this sin, but I got rid of porn and I sin only in times of those crazy crysis' because my mind is like trained to create very vivid fantasies and I sometimes cannot stop it from happening, and when it's there I can only get rid of it if I got to do something that doesn't include my college. Learning for finals is so hard for me, most of the times because I cannot make myself think about something that my mind simply don't want to think about. And if crysis strikes at moment when I must learn new things, i just need that clarity. I cannot simply left my homework to do biceps curls in moment like those, so relieving myself and going to confession is only way I can fight this shit for now. But college will end and there will be time when I am far enough from porn that my brain will also be healthier, and if I marry I will add one way of relieving myself the way God and myself won't loath upon. And I won't mention falling of libido with age. Good luck mate!"
285,f4p0jod,"Thing is projecting birth rates onto the future for an infinite period of time never works. If history were won by the most fertile than Bangladesh would be the most powerful nation on earth right now. But like all Islamic regions its a basket case.

Muslims talk the talk about 'taking over' but their walk is a clumsy, pathetic one.

The past 5 years shows exactly how weak they truly are - China humiliates them and Pakistan still bows to the Chinese, The Bengali ""Rohingyas"" tried to get cute in Burma, I guess that didn't work out well for them. Even backward stone age India humiliates them. A tiny Jewish nation is like 11-0 against them. Jews are considered asthmatic-intellectuals by most people.

Imagine if a nation of strong engineers with a history of extreme, aggressive tendencies towards reprisal (Germany) started to pay attention to this? It would take them 3 days tops to round them up and send them all into the sea to be happy and free.

Plus nobody will tell you this, but the crisis of faith in Muslim countries is at critical mass. Iran is almost as atheist as Britain and their birth rates are even lower. Muslim women are seen as so virtuous by some Westerners; they aren't. I could have almost any of them, they would marry you or me just to get out of their crappy countries and would convert to any other religion of I asked them to (when they are away from the islamic violence).

So the ""black pill"" view is not always as simple as one thinks and the idea of bus boys and taxi drivers ""taking over"" a technologically sofisticated region still begs the question of how exactly they would pull that one off?

Hijacking a airplane is about as sophisticated an attack as they can muster, me thinks. I think 9.11 was their heyday since the Siege of Baghad 1258, the last day that they had any real power in the world at all.

If you want to act as saviors to muslim women because of standards in their community, then don't replicate them in your own. Don't be a hypocrite. It always comes down to being ""allowed to dress how they want,"" because that is essentially a right &amp; freedom that people should be entitled to. It's nothing to scoff at.

Being an athiest/agnostic state can be just as discriminatory as being a religious state. I guess Quebec isn't a province that welcomes people of all backgrounds, it only welcomes those with a specific belief set. Ok. Sure. Even tho the rest of us were born here and belong here just as much as you."
288,evvw0zt,"&gt; for some very far-Left politics, even more so than Sanders in some positions.

Like?  Progressive policies are not new to American political discourse.  Muslim women are.

&gt;because they are very happy to attack the more moderate Democratic leaders

Democratic leaders are not moderate.  They're status quo corporate puppets.  Attacking them is what should be done, as they try their hardest to prevent change, since change and progress reduce their bottom lines.  Dem leaders have the same goals as the Republican party: make their rich friends richer.

everything you say is a distraction from the fact that Trump and Republican voters only hate on these women because of their backgrounds.  Nothing more."
289,ew4o2hp,"&gt;So you're saying that when someone is killed, this is an exception that is faced with legal ramifications, and not standard protocol.

&gt;That's what I'm saying. You're not doing a good job defending your point.

*Firing* someone is an appropriate response to *murder?*

Try again. 

&gt;How is it misapplied? When Muslim women are given the exact same treatment that other citizens are given without discrimination, it's misapplied?

&gt;If I wanted to wear a Balaclava, I'm not harming anyone. But I can't. Because of anti mask laws. Same with said Muslim women. They're being treated the same way other women are, with the exact same laws. This is because in the Netherlands, people don't get to break the law just because they want, and the law applies to everyone equally.

&gt;Sounds like the legal system doing what it's supposed to do.

&gt;As I said. Just as Judy can't wear a Balaclava, Maryam can't wear a Burqa. Equal laws, both are treated the same ways.

&gt;**The Netherlands cares. As does Europe. Everyone is treated equally by the law. Equality is a big thing in European culture, unlike Islam.**

That's perfectly mentally disabled due to multitudes of reasons. You can harm so many people by abusing this retarded value by ignoring exceptions or making rules that are too broad. 

Let's put men and women in a boxing ring, have them fight to death, let's give the disabled no treatment, because ""equality.""

I'll rephrase this. Laws that were put in place and harmed no one previously is now applying to a group despite it harming them, all in the name of upholding this retarded virtue. So fucking what? Give an actual justification for this virtue and the application of it. 

&gt;Then similarly, ""no1 curr"" about Muslims women who want to break the law. You get treated the same way as other civilians, deal with it.

I made a mistake giving you the benefit of the doubt and assumed you were being obtuse instead of disabled. ""Kinda arrogant"" is retarded because it's a subjective statement that came straight out of your own ass. 



&gt;Pretty much. Anti mask laws trace their origins to the early 1900s, as a result of masked riots.

&gt;https://www.google.com.tr/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-mask_laws&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjr4fu4u-7jAhWYxMQBHSyfAp4QFjABegQIDRAG&amp;usg=AOvVaw2AmDmpC0nB3S3hltLRwUzP

&gt;Identification is a very important thing in Europe. The police and security cameras should be able to easily identify who you are.

&gt;&gt;**KSA works perfectly despite the burqa.**

&gt;**As you say, ""No1curr""**

&gt;**Saudi Arabia =/= Europe.**

Are you too mentally disabled to realise my point about how the burqa affects little to nothing about security or are you being intentionally obtuse? I can't tell with you. 

You have technology. You can have the identities of burqa-wearers. You have the police. The fucking Netherlands is the last place to undergo a violent attack. I'll consider your arrested ""equality"" jeer a more workable argument.  

&gt;How is freedom of religion being taken away from them?

It is, quite literally and technically, a restriction on freedom of religion. It's moral ramifications are currently being discussed. 

&gt;Wait what? How is any of this caused by the internet?

You live under the rock, don't you? 

&gt;Says the person who thinks that the law should not apply to their group and they should be allowed to break the law, but **no one else should be allowed to,** *(???, Don't remember saying this)* and they should be able to break the law because that's what they want to do.

&gt;Hypocritic much? 

Meh, they can too."
290,ewo80zy,"What the hell is my ideal world? Islam is a religion that teaches its adherents that a woman is less than a man in many ways. A woman living in an Islamic country (or those adhering to Islam in non-Islamic countries) will always be a second rate citizen. She will always be told what to wear and what not to wear. She will be told it is her responsibility to control the wandering eye of perverted men and that it is her fault if their gaze falls upon her. Her fault if they like what they see and decide to take it for themselves. She will be told she May only take a Muslim husband, but a Muslim man will be free to take a wife of any religion. She will be told that it’s fine for her husband to take 3 more wives, but not for her. No, she will be seen as ‘used’ or ‘dirty’ if she so much divorces her husband and seeks out another. She will be told her accounts are worth less than a man’s. She will be told that she was made from a man. She will be told she is not as intelligent as a man. Shes is not capable of running a home, never mind a nation. She will be valued based on her virginity. She will be sexualized from as young as 5 and made to wear a hijab to suppress that sexuality. This isn’t subjective, Muslim women are victims. I don’t care if you’re Muslim and disagree, you’re simply indoctrinated. As a woman I know Islam is an attack on my very being."
291,eqzv237,"As an Islamic feminist, I cannot find myself for nor against the Hijab. I am, rather, pro-women's choice in the matter and I believe most Islamic feminists tend to be. The World Hijab Day's intent is to remove this... *ortherizing* many Western figures have done against Muslim women. [There is little doubt that Muslim women](https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/09/violence-against-hijabi-women-in-new-york-joins-islamophobia-with-misogyny.html) face harassment and assault due to their garments. The Canadian Counsel of Women collected stories of Niqabi women in a document titled *Women In Niqab Speak.* Here are some excerpts:

&gt;**I)** Once I was in the line \[at the grocery store\] and an old couple said, “Now you are here in Canada.” My husband was with me, but the man said, “You’re in Canada now, you don’t have to do it, haven’t you learned something?”**II)** I was doing my grocery shopping and I thought the lady was picking something from the racks, but she pulled my niqab.**III)** A number of interviewees did say that they were sometimes afraid of being harassed or attacked – a feeling described by one woman as “fear in our hearts” – and an interviewee in the province of Québec who had worn her face-veil for eight years remembered incidents much more serious than stares and remarks.

And then a British study titled Behind the Veil stated:

&gt;Nearly 80 percent of our interviewees reported that they had been abused as a result of wearing their niqab; 13 percent of respondents said they had been both verbally and physically harassed.

After Boris Johnson published a column against Muslim garments, the [Guardian reported](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/14/unsafe-muslim-women-fear-abuse-boris-johnson-burqa):

&gt;The anti-Muslim hate-crime monitoring group Tell Mama has reported a  spike in abuse against Muslim women since Johnson’s column appeared. In  the week before the column was published, five women reported incidents  against them (all were wearing the hijab, and none wore the niqab). In  the week after the column, 14 women wearing the hijab and seven who wore  the niqab reported abuse to the organisation. These figures are likely to be much lower than the real number. A  Tell Mama spokesperson says: “Bear in mind that niqab-wearing women  rarely report anti-Muslim hate. In work we have done with them, they  have mentioned that they receive abuse on such a frequent level, they do  not bother to report it. So the rise is measurable and important.”

All empirical reports include Hijabi and Niqabi women feeling [scared of being outside](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2019/5/24/frances-anti-hijab-laws-drive-muslim-women-into-the-shadows) and are generally driven *back into shadows*. [Frequent hate crimes](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/19/us/new-york-anti-muslim-harassment-survey-trnd/index.html) against Hijabi women are quite evident. Here is a bit from [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_nz/article/nz8pgm/how-islamophobia-hurts-muslim-women-the-most):

&gt;Increasingly, Muslim women are bearing the brunt of the hate. Recent incidents on Muslim women have seen them pushed in front of incoming trains; punched and kicked off buses; and attacked whilst collecting their children from school. And it's Muslim women who wear the hijab most at risk. ""Visible  Muslim women encounter the most violence and harassment at a street  level,"" ""There's a definite gender issue here at work  when it comes to anti-Muslim hate."" He says that 80 percent of the  attacks after Paris were on women, and that the reasons for this are  partly practical. ""There's a visibility factor. It's easy to identify  Muslim women who dress in Islamic dress. And also there's the fact that  they are less likely to fight back.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**What's interesting is that when we speak to perpetrators they say they'd  never normally attack a woman. But they feel like they can target  Muslim women, because they didn't see them as female. They've  dehumanized them so much that they can't see their identity in a  gendered way anymore. The only thing they see is that they are Muslim.""**

It is no secret that Muslim women are [extremely otherized](https://unu.edu/publications/articles/confronting-prejudice-against-muslim-women-in-the-west.html) as being *weak* or morally dissonant with the *enlightened West.* This narrative acts as affirmation for a certain demographic that their harassment is rather a justified *teaching moment*. This consequently results in [less Hijabi women being hired](https://www.enar-eu.org/IMG/pdf/forgotten_women_report_united_kingdom_-_final.pdf) (UK), or being [commonly discriminated in their work places](https://www.enar-eu.org/IMG/pdf/forgotten_women_report_belgium_-_final.pdf)(Belgium) and harassment against them is less likely [to be investigated](https://www.enar-eu.org/IMG/pdf/forgotten_women_report_france_-_final.pdf)(France) or even taken [seriously](https://www.enar-eu.org/IMG/pdf/forgotten_women_report_germany_-_final.docx.pdf)(Germany). The discrimination is not limited to work-place, of course, it extends to young girls in [educational environments](https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4462&amp;context=etd). What's worse is that the Hijab is oft used as a tool in support of [Western Imperialism](https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/10/muslim-women-stereotypes/), to convey how weak and pathetic women are in Muslim nations and require *saving.* This [source](https://www.crimejusticejournal.com/article/view/764/519) states that:

&gt;One woman explicitly noted that the people that are at most risk of receiving hate crime are the people who look visibly Muslim. Like a Muslim woman who walks down the street, and she wears a niqab.

And a lot of it, according to the source, relates to how *alien* Muslim women are presented as being. It's all a bit hypocritical for in the pursuit of *freeing* these women, they only further [isolate them](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/08/denmark-burqa-veil-ban/566630/). Therefore, such a movement is necessitated due to the discrimination Hijabi women face (have been witness to many, many, many occurrences of mild and rather violent harassment against women in my family). At the face time, we are faced with a conundrum: are we undermining the women of culturally regressive countries? Here are women attempting to fight against the very fabric which defines the identity of many women in the West. It's seems as if choosing between propagating the very tool used for subjugation of these women in certain countries or adding to the narrative used for discrimination and hate-crimes within other countries. Should we then have a *World Non-Hijab Day* where the alt-right will flood through with their banners against Muslims, feeling as if their hatred is legitimized? Take for example [Yasmine Muhammad's](https://web.archive.org/web/20190202062034/https://torontosun.com/news/provincial/opinion-support-muslim-women-in-fight-against-hijab) advocacy of a No Hijab Day where she proposes this cloth is intrinsically dehumanizing and women must be freed- yes, even those who had a choice in the matter. Well, yes, absolutely the Hijab is dehumanizing within certain contexts. Yet, it is quite freeing for women in other contexts. What Yasmine did is legitimize alt-right discrimination yet, at the same time, fought despotic patriarchy of the so-called *Islamic countries.* It seems like a double-edged sword. Currently I support the World Hijab Day due to the hatred I've witnessed against myself and the people dear to me but at the same time I feel the need to remember and propagate the cause of women who fight for their rights in other nations. Ultimately, we can't allow ourselves to forget either of these groups for their wish is quite similar: self-expression."
292,ej1pygq,"&gt;So what?  That in no way reduces the need to critisize Islam.

293,ej3swuk,"Posted by an anthropologist in Wellington:
Some of you might have seen the calls for women in New Zealand to wear headscarves in solidarity with Muslim women tomorrow (Friday 22 March). There have been a few questions raised about the appropriateness of this, including whether it is cultural appropriation.

This morning Tarapuhi Vaeau and I spoke with Shahed Omar Abu Jwaied about the initiative to wear headscarves in solidatiry with Muslim women on Friday, and have included her comments below with her permission. Shahed is the CEO of Integrate Women International and approaches this topic with her anthropological background. 

We asked, is wearing a headscarf an appropriate form of action? 

“The scarf is a very strong form of support. Muslim women are usually targeted as Muslim women because of it – you can tell straight away that she is Muslim because of her scarf,” said Shahed.

“Some Muslim women are telling me that they want to take the scarf off because it is the clearest form of their identity, so for women in New Zealand to come together and take it on symbolises that you’ll be safe, this is your identity, and we are supporting you by wearing it as well.”

We also asked what a safe space would look like for our Muslim communities right now.

“Muslim people don’t need much at this time, apart from people making them feel that they’re there for them, giving some comfort, saying ‘we’ve got your back, we know it’s hard,’ supporting them in whatever ways they can. Some are not directly affected by the attack but feel anxious and insecure. If businesses want to help, they might ask their Muslim employees if they want a day or two off to think about what is going on, especially tomorrow (Friday). People might want to go to Christchurch as well, to support and pray with the rest of the people on the souls of the dead.”

Shahed also spoke about worries and concerns that Muslim people have shared with her about responses from white people. Muslim people have been feeling that they are becoming voiceless in their workplaces, where there is often a tendency for white people to centre themselves in their responses. For example, some Muslim people who want to help have not been encouraged to do so in their workplaces because white people think they can help more. It is important for people to support Muslims, and one of the ways to do this is by providing a platform for Muslim voices. "
294,ejbhrpp,"I've seen quite a few videos of muslim women pulling non muslims, and muslims, out of cars for not wearing hijabs; physically attacking them. And many where the Muslim women call for men to come beat the women they feel are violating Sharia. 
I think the Muslim women are just as, if not more, complicit as the men are in the attack against the rights of women. 
As a woman, it turns my stomach to see modern ""feminists"" supporting a sect that is ACTIVELY persecuting women. "
295,ekxi73w,"Hey look I got to school where just under 50% of students are Muslim in a high Muslim population area and in my experience most young Muslim women are very liberal and I know a lot of them that are against Sharia law and religious police etc. 

However the story is different when it comes to young men, most of them are nice enough people that won’t attack anyone physically for who they are, but that certainly will make it know that they support the killing of people their religion dislikes. Like most recently when homosexuality was outlawed in Brunai I heard plenty of young Muslim men saying this is a good thing and it should be status quo.

But this is just my experience, most are fine enough people who will never hurt anyone physically, but they certainly have some very harmful beliefs, though as long as it’s just kept to what they believe and doesn’t translate into action it doesn’t really bother me that much."
296,eiutuwv,"&gt;“I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.” (1 Timothy 2:12)

&gt;-Women must serve men, same as sharia law.

I'm not reading past this if your Gish Gallop is going to be this awful right out of the gate.

First, go read the verses beforehand instead of copypasting that from whatever New Atheist blog you read that from, and tell me if this was a line Jesus delivered to his disciples.

Second, if you think the two are comparable, then explain to me, for a moment, why modern churches that practice Christianity don't force women to cover themselves (besides nuns) whereas Islamic women are forced to where hijabs, *or* why most countries today that are prominently Christians actually try to give women equal rights while Islamic countries treat women as second class citizens.

*Third*, explain how this excuses Islam for being oppressive. Fundamentalist Christians don't have a place in government power either, but they aren't committing terror attacks in the same magnitude as Islamic radicals. Sorry, but Westboro Baptist Church holding a protest that gets drowned out by motorcycle gangs is 100% not comparable to the Lower Manhattan Attack.

*Fourth*, are you really trying to compare ""don't speak over your husband"" with Sharia Law's treatment of women?

The Quran literally instructs men to beat their wives if they disobey.

&gt;Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

(4:34)

The Quran teaches its followers that a wife's purpose is to be a fuckdoll.

&gt;Your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you, so come to your place of cultivation however you wish and put forth [righteousness] for yourselves. And fear Allah and know that you will meet Him. And give good tidings to the believers.

(2:223)

Or how about the infamous ""a woman's witness is worth half of a man's?""

&gt;But if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of the women errs, then the other can remind her.

(2:282 - abridged to relevant portion).

&gt;You support a bronze age death cult based around an arbitrary, violent, misogynistic, slave driver.

You mean Muhammad, right? Jesus never owned a slave, and all you did was quote John. Muhammad, the prophet of the religion you're trying to defended, literally taught his followers to beat their wives, owned slaves from enemies of his jihad, and responded to violence with violence. You have them backward, right down to the ""barbaric goatfucker"" comment.

At this point, I have to ask why you're so hell-bent on defending a death cult. Are you a lonely, misogynist virgin that thinks women losing independence might be good for your chances to have sex? Do you just hate people? There's no good answer for it. There's no good answer for you defending a death cult that has no place in Western civilization."
297,ekx0fqp,"&gt; ex Muslim criticizing my religion

If you are not a Muslim, how is it *your* religion?

You don't believe in Zeus, is the Greek mythology *your* religion too?

Regardless, you posted this to attack a sitting member of Congress and in reply to a post titled ""Ever notice how Islamic men are complete pussies and cowards?""

I think that pretty clearly shows where you are coming from, whether there is any truth to your personal story or not."
298,ekx239o,"What did I post that was inaccurate? Be specific.

Also, tell me again why you posted this to attack a sitting member of Congress (but not others guilty of the same) and in reply to a post titled ""Ever notice how Islamic men are complete pussies and cowards?"" 

Like I said, that pretty clearly shows where you are coming from."
299,ea0acvb,"Muslim women are oppressed because Muslim men - the veil suggests - can’t control their animal instinct. Hijab suggests Muslim men have an inherent inability to be civil in a civilized society. Don’t put the belittled welcoming of Muslim culture in free societies on women - of color or white - in the West. To see women in burqinis, along with their bare-chested Muslim fathers, brothers, and husbands enjoying cool water on their skin at the community pool, is proof positive of severe oppression of Muslim women BY Muslim men - NOT by any Westerner. And until this blatant oppression of women within Islamic culture stops, Muslim people will not be welcome in Western culture. Such observable behavior makes large numbers of Westerners nervous. It’s oppressive of women, and freedom becomes vulnerable. Where does my duty to welcome end, and where does your obligation to modify your culture for assimilation begin? Tell your men to grow up and be responsible for their own purity and gateway to god. Stop refusing to assimilate into Western culture. The more Muslims immigrate into Western culture and refuse to assimilate, the more at-risk Western women’s freedom becomes. It’s already happening in Europe - read about the planned group attack and raping of Western women in Cologne, Germany by Muslim men that happened only 2 years ago."
300,ebja08o,"There's probably a simpler program that automates the task but what I'm doing is:

1.)Open up in Pandas

2.)Set the data to just be a certain sub-group. For instance we might look at how Americans or Christians answered the other questions.

3.)Compare to how the rest voted.

One simple thing I'll look at/ update is how Americans, Jews, Israelis, Muslims, and Christians voted on the Israel question compared to others. 

&gt;Update:

&gt;Americans, non-Americans, Brits, Aussies, etc. are almost identical in their views of the Israel-Palestine Conflict. The large sub-group of goldandblack that claims to be Russian though is entirely pro-Israel.

&gt;Atheists, Agnostics, and Theists all have roughly the same opinions of the Israel-Palestine Conflict

&gt;Type of theist is pretty interesting. Christians basically think the same as Atheists and the general userbase on the topic. Hindus are neutral. Jews are like 60% pro-Israel. Muslims are 90% pro-Palestine. Unitarians 100% think both sides are bad and Wiccans are 50% pro-Israel 50% both sides are bad. This also suggest the religious figures are probably pretty accurate as the responses are what you'd expect. 

I may make a bunch of various plots. Any one want a question answered or looked at? I'll also try to figure out how to attach figures but all I can think of is a dropbox like format or a very large image. 

Also you can convert to .csv easily by opening the drop box .ods file with google sheets and savings as .csv

I'm also very unsure about the data quality. The 5% Muslim, 6% Russian, and 4% Buddhist seem a little bit suspect. Oh well can only work with what you have. 

A plus is we can also ""sort of"" filter out trolls. For instance we can filter out whoever voted ""Attack Helicopter"" on gender or ""Yes, Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer"" to sort of filter out trolls responses, though obviously that's not perfect as people may give a sincere reponse for half their answers and troll responses for the other half. 

Also a followup on the Russia response: Of the 6% of GoldandBlacker's who responded that they live in Russia, apparently 75% of those are Female. So like 40% of those that responded as biological females claim to be Russian. These Russian Women are also 95% pro-Israel which accounts for ~50% of the pro-Israel responses. They're also 1/3 Jewish and 1/3 Hindu. That said, a lot of the other responses from these Russian Women look to be somewhat legitimate, for instance the response to the ""What were you before you were libertarian?"" has many varied responses and also responses you'd think would come from real Russians such as 30% Statist and 10% Communist. 

Some other stats on our Russian Women: They are split about 30% for Agorism, 30% for Spacesteading, and 30% for Seasteading. The other 10% is divided between Crypto and ~2% endorse the Free State Project. About 30% of them listed Donald Trump as their ""Favorite Libertarian Thinker"". They're also much older than the GAB average with about 50% of them being 50 or older (like 5% each in 50-54 and then 25% in 55+). Further, none of them believe Ted Cruz to be the Zodiac Killer suggesting they're interesting trolls at least not to take the bait. 

Here's the imgur album showing the piecharts for our Russian Women:

https://imgur.com/a/p8bxD3m

Another question I had: Who are Libertarian Women? Do they differ in any way from Libertarian men?

They are about 60% Bi (between 2.0 and 4.0 on the Kinsey Scale), this compares with about 10% of men who are in the same range. 10% of girls are a 6.0/ completely gay as opposed to ~3% of guys. Leaving about 30% of girls who are completely straight. 

Besides that the main differences between goldandblack men and women is that women are much more likely to have kids ~40% to ~10%. They're also much more likely to not be libertarians, 30% to 5%. The majority who aren't list some form of rightwing such as alt-right, fascist, or conservative. 

Women are also much more likely to be pro-Palestine. Though this could be a combination of a few other factors: For instance GAB women are MUCH more religious than GAB men (60% Religious to 25% Religious), further women are much more likely to be Muslim at ~10%, and I'm inclined to believe them. These muslim women are married with kids, have otherwise non-troll like answers, and claim to be in Middle Eastern countries so I'm inclined to believe they're being honest. Maybe the solution to recruiting more women is to start preaching liberty at women's centers in Baghdad? 

GAB women are also much less American(40% to 65%). 

Women also are much more diverse in their personality types tho INTJ and INTP are still dominant.

Again, feel free to ask me to look into any particular question. I'm doing this analysis using the python library pandas. 
"
301,e6eo15g,"I’d wager no; but I don’t like where we stand right now anyways. The fact that Islam has become some amalgamation of culture, immigrant/minority icon &amp; “religion of peace” frankly disgusts me. The fact we can sit on a podium and proclaim hateful, bigoted narrations about the actions of Islam’s founders and actual Islamic beliefs and people don’t even bat an eyelash (as if it doesn’t matter that these things are being taught to our societies children), or worse still, actually attack us for defaming this cult, horrifies me. The fact that we have reached a point where we can plainly see a direct correlation between Islam and regressive anti western rules and order and people still don’t point out the bullsh*t whilst countless non (and who’re we kidding, actual) Muslim women are being raped and enslaved and abused and indoctrinated and pressured and forced into this backwater cult with no choice in matters that could irreparably alter their lives, just plainly confuses me; like what country, what world, cares so little for their fellow man that they feel allowing a parent to mutilate their child (FGM and circumcision), allowing an institution (mosques) which has displayed systematic child abuse and an unwillingness to allow children to make up their own minds (going on for decades, if not centuries), allowing a faith which has wrought terror on a scale unimaginable for any self respecting human being; in what world can u bring a child into where so many are being so horrifically abused.

 Fuck Islam, fuck Allah, fuck Muhammad, and fuck anyone who thinks god is anything more then some fucked up voyeuristic, narcissistic, inhumane, dick with a boner for watching humanity destroy itself over the very fact we have no idea whether he exists or not."
302,e2v3ykz,"I mean I was referencing more the study from the Zurich researchers that found that Lower Saxony has about 750,000 migrants, a bit less than 200,000 of whom applied for asylum. They found that although between 2007 and 2014, violent and sexual crime had been reduced by some 21%, it had gone back up by a little more than 10% by the end of 2016, and 92% of that crime increase was attributable to the newcomers. Migrant men between 14 and 30 made up around 9% of the population in Lower Saxony and we’re responsible for about 27% of all violent and sexual crime. All of these stats were also only published by the researchers, not by the police themselves, or by the government officials who had access to this information but chose not to share it for fear of both causing civil unrest and hurting Angela Merkel’s public image.

Then, admittedly, I took liberties and drew parallels to the Rotherham and Telford Muslim rape gangs in the UK who were able to act without fear of law enforcement for years, and carried out their own islamic law system without any pushback... but that wasn’t Germany, so that’s me being hyperbolic, I’ll own that.

But yeah, Cologne was awful, and I’m glad that one wasn’t swept under the rug at a local level, but on a national scale, it wasn’t even reported on until about a week after it happened, only after Germans (rightfully) raged on social about how nobody was covering it., and to date, there have been 6 convictions out of the about 2,000 allegations. The police chief was transferred to “provisional retirement” because of this incident and how delayed and meager the police response to this attack was.

As for blaming all Muslims for the actions of a few, I completely agree! It would be really stupid to do that. There’s hundreds of millions of Muslims who wouldn’t think about commuting these atrocities, they would loudly decry the criminals and show nothing but support to the victims. But the people who raped German girls and boys are Muslims and using their religion to justify those actions. I might be wrong about this but I think it was the group of 4 men convicted of sexual assaults in Cologne who were the ones that said they did it because non-Muslim women are good for nothing but to be used as whores and then thrown away like trash. That’s pretty religiously motivated, at least in my opinion.

But you are correct, I don’t think it’s all Muslims and I didn’t mean to imply that in my first comment. I’ll try to edit it and use better wording so I don’t look like a reactionary insane person."
303,e40ki7k,"Let's be clear, the liberal society we live in is in no way female liberalization.   We have completely destroyed gender roles and forced women into the work place, we have ripped them from their families and the traditional gender roles, tricked them into becoming sexually liberated which hinders the prosepects of happy family life, tricked them into working on a career that often deprives them of their prime child rearing years.   

They have been completely swindled, and as a consequence many men are deprived of good women as well.   Tack on student debt and an inability to start a family.   

I would say that women are completely repressed.   And in many instances, it could be shown that Muslim women are in fact much happier to be apart of a society that forces them into that role.  I don't agree with it, certainly.   We are all completely wrong with regards to women and the roles they play in human society.   

We can't have strong families if we need women to be in the work force to pay for the welfare/warfare state.   We can't have strong families when women are getting pregnant at 30+ as the norm.   We can't have strong families when both men and women are all saddled with crippling amounts of debt.  

We don't have a strong society when women are hyper sexualized.   We don't have a strong society when men are tricked into a life of pornography and neglecting the human connection of sex because they are convinced that women are evil or shitty.   

Women, being more emotional creatures, do need men to take the lead.   Men are the natural protectors of society and we need them to make tough decisions FOR women.   That picture of a crying child being separated from her parents at the boarder is an emotional attack on us that might work much better on a woman than a man.   So in many instances we need the level-headedness of men.   I would go so far to say that often our own ""democracy"" is used against us.   And fetishizing voting and ""everyone has a voice"" etc is all a trick to use the political process against ourselves.   We may need to consider that women should not have the right to vote.   I think democracy is a meme, and a weapon used to control and destroy society.   Why do we think the U.S. and the powers that be are so adament about spreading democracy?   They can rig it, and those in the media know how to shift public opinion on things through propaganda.   It is similar to someone using the first amendment to take away the first amendment which is happening now.   At some point we do have to make some very concerted concessions that alien, internal threats are attacking us with our own rights and government.   We're being tricked into blowing our own heads off.  So if we want this shit to stop we really have to start breaking the rules because we are in a life or death struggle.  This is the moment where we decide if America is America for our grandchildren, or if they inherit Mexico 2.0.    Mexicans and liberals don't care about our civil liberties and the capitalist class that is moving third worlders into first world nations WANT to destroy our cultures because it makes it that much harder for us to organize against their interests.   It's time to start breaking the rules of contemporary political thought.  If you think that the politicians of the past will fix the problems of today you are sadly mistaken.   Do we honestly think we can vote in Newt Gingrich or someone similar to solve anything?   We need new ideas for a new America and we need to have a fundamental change in how we look at the world if we want to survive.   We will not find solutions to these problems by looking to conservatism.   Dinesh Dzouza or libertarianism are failures of the past,   and we will not find salvation in the past.   We have to look at what is broken, and understand why it broke.   But ultimately after isolating these items, we have to fix them and fix them PERMANENTLY.  We have to play for keeps in the same way the capitalist class is doing so.   They are importing third worlders that will leave a permanent and lasting scar on the face of humanity that may literally never be undone!   This is the magnitude of evil we are up against.   We may damn well have to endure a civil war over this.   We are fooling ourselves into thinking the globalists have not forced upon us the binary option of civil conflict or the slow death of demographic shift into totalitarianism.   You are not going to be able to buy stocks and vote Republican and just wish this all away.   The Muslim problem will not go away.   The most common name of newborns in Britain is Mohammed for Christ Sakes!    Britain's children have been subject to mass gang rapes by foreigners!   There is a pedophilia problem in all levels of government across the globe and this is the catalyst for which our own politicians are being blackmailed.   The clock is ticking everyone, and the longer we look to conservatism, libertarianism, or that nonsense we will only find losing strategies.   They are literally tearing down your statues to honor your ancestors because the plan is to fully erase your identity and your destruction as a people, rights and all are destined for the rubbish bin of history.   
Good riddance.  "
304,e1inzq1,"Yeah and, following your train of thought, most Christians aren't Christian, most Buddhists aren't Buddhist...in reality no one follows a religion to the letter.  Most holy books contain instructions to murder other people as punishment for transgressions.  The bible gives instructions on stonings for both men and women - and even a bull!  They're texts of thier time and should be viewed as such.  I don't like religion:  it causes war, suffering, death, etc.  I agree it's used as a tool to control people - especially women.  But vitriolic tirades aren't exactly offering a hand of support to women.  

&gt; They are oppressed and it is very difficult and slow to get their rights without help. We should help them as much as we can.

Dude you straight up said you ""despise"" these people:  why the hell do you think they want your help?  This type of absue can drive women further into the arms of thier families where at least they're not being hated on for being Muslim.  Muslim women are working against the patriachal controls within thier cultures:  they need support &amp; platforms, not being told they need protection.

&gt; And yes I do think muslim women need some help.

You weren't talking about helping them or offering support services for those wanting to exit, you were deciding what they think, what they need and who they are.  Your outright attack won't enable them to gain rights and freedoms.  You stated:

&gt; Islam does not need to be challenged in our homeland

Which homeland is that exactly?"
305,dwm0apc,"The feminism that all these muslim women are falling in the trap of promoting is western liberal feminism, it is inherently atheistic, secular and down right blasphemous, they follow all the same leaders, use the same rhetoric, attack the same principles. This feminism has led many people to become apostates, it is diametrically opposed to Islam. "
306,dwo0r80,"UK here. This country (on the surface) seems largely intact compared to America's slow decline but things are getting worse to some degree lately. Forgive my long post, even if it sounds like I'm rambling here and there:

**Weather**:

The weather has been odd this year. It snowed more times in a row than any other winter in the last couple of years, but right now we're getting April showers as expected. The last summer and autumn were the hottest this country had experienced so far and I felt like I was going to die. I can't imagine what this summer will be like for the UK and the rest of the world.

My best friend on the other hand thinks that advances in science will help mankind, even in the face of the climate apocalypse we're heading into. I'd hate to break it to him, but if that were the case, the human race would be working on it right now. He's not the only one who's delusional about global warming, my sister thinks it's a myth and shows no real concern for her infant son's future. Almost everyone around me thinks that because it's the UK, the weather is supposed to be this bad.

**Mental**:

Mental health is still a colossal problem here but nobody wants to truly discuss it. Half of the people I meet have some kind of mental disorder, addiction or depression. Every psychiatrist I ever talk to that's under the NHS' payroll seems nonchalant or uncaring, actively prescribing antidepressants for even the littlest of anxiety issues that have nothing to do with disorders (I had this experience myself since the early 2000s).

**Social**:

Socialising with people is like walking a tightrope these days. Most of the people I end up talking to initially show friendliness but some of them later show their true colours when I know them long enough. Even conversations with some people these days are very awkward, with too many vulgarities and a certain amount of disrespect for other people behind their backs. You walk across the street and some of the millennial women are texting or using WhatsApp WHILE WALKING at the same time (I know this happens everywhere but it annoys me when I keep seeing it). Fights or arguments keep breaking out in public between strangers over the littlest of things.

People seem to lack class and manners, eyeing you up with suspicion even if you're just walking past them, minding your own business. Not to be paranoid or anything, but I get stared at no matter how well-trimmed or dressed I am. It's like people just don't care about being polite anymore. 

If that wasn't enough, the mainstream music being produced here or abroad is increasingly sexual, misogynistic and egotistical. A song can become a hit for a month and then is quickly discarded when another piece of rubbish hits the airwaves. The youth treat these pathetic celebrities like gods and try to emulate them, instead of thinking for themselves. And this demonstrates the sheep-like mentality of people if they give more priority to these things than actively working on themselves or their communities.

**Crime**:

I keep hearing horror stories of how the police in this country try to cover up their own crimes by murdering witnesses (i.e. drug dealers). The councils are becoming more corrupt whilst squeezing the working classes dry for money and they'll try by any means to get away with it. Violent criminals (a number of them in gangs) in my area are upgrading from knives to guns. The police also confiscate their phones so these gangs communicate via weird radios on their hips. 

Also, we're seeing an increase of hate crimes, especially toward Muslims. Muslim women are having their head scarfs pulled off of them or get punched in the face at random. Just last week we had a wave of acid attacks against random Muslims, and one such attack was nearby where I live. Since I come from an Islamic background (though I rarely practice), I worry for my friends and family, and I'm afraid to leave the house now.

**Economy**:

Where I live (Northwest London), there's so many unsold shop spaces. It's getting expensive and too risky to purchase a shop in the high street these days. In my hometown, and in the Greater London area, you're more likely to make a killing by opening up chicken shops and betting shops, since people are addicted to greasy junk food and gambling some of their benefits. It's really sad.

Unemployment is still high, despite the media lies that it's decreasing, and it's affecting the spirit of the jobless ever more. Some of my past friends would have suicidal thoughts after just a month or two of being unemployed.

**Conclusion**:

As a whole, the UK is in a decline. The amount of corruption, social injustice and apathy from folks around me is becoming more and more evident each day. As for myself, for the first time in my 30 years of being alive, I'm feeling increasingly nihilistic from the political situations and the ever approaching apocalyptic events. I've neglected the things I'm passionate about because of depression and spend most of my days on the sofa, streaming YouTube, watching anime and playing video games (thought I'd be honest so it didn't seem like I was taking shots at other people exclusively). 

This constant barrage of bad news is disheartening for one who wants to chase their dreams and the time left to make something of myself is shrinking, so I think, what's the point anymore?

Again, sorry for the long post."
307,dx3s9ym,I don't understand wtf is wrong with Indian Muslim women? For once bjp is actually doing something nice for them. If these regressive laws is scrapped Muslim women will have marital security. I don't understand why Muslim women are taking this as an attack and not as a reform. I can't understand what is going in mind of these women who are pro-polygamy? Don't they feel jealous?
308,dx99mqu,"False. Go ask some of the 'many' Muslim women you know. Its frightening that someone who so passionately advocates for a religion is so ignorant of its practices. 

Also, nice personal attack. Very classy.

 ""Muslim women are required to observe the hijab in front of any man they could theoretically marry. This means that hijab is not obligatory in front of the father, brothers, grandfathers, uncles or young children. Hijab does not need to be worn in front of other Muslim women, but there is debate about what can be revealed to non-Muslim women.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/hijab_1.shtml"
309,dv2y6y5,"Islam throws gay people off buildings, Palestinians have declined 5 offers for a two state solution in the Middle East (one included giving them 93% of the West Bank), Muslim women are oppressed and are forced into marriages consistently, out of all the Saudi Arabian students at my university I haven’t seen one woman (except for the wife of one of them, and she wouldn’t dare talk to any other man much less make eye contact; my observation).

Now this one time a Muslim student I befriended stole from me. I talked to his brothers about it. So, we got together and when we talked about it the, kid who stole came after me with a pool stick after they condemned him for his actions. The brothers basically snatched him mid swing and beat his ass. 

After that they told me “Our Home is your home”. So, I do have Muslim friends. Half of that group are now Christian. Oh, and in Islam it’s ok to kill apostates. I wonder why they’ve never went back to Saudi. 

Also, i have less issues with liberals, and my issues are mostly with the left. I didn’t vote for Trump or Clinton, but then again did anyone have a say with the electoral college, but our representatives? And no non-citizens shouldn’t vote. Yet, people are complaining that we don’t have a popular vote when illegals are being encouraged to vote. 

As a prosecutor I will be pushing for heavy legislation to make sure illegals don’t have a say in our democracy; just as the Russians shouldn’t. 

The left is playing identity politics.

Regarding the PragerU “propaganda”; you’re literally saying the woman’s story in video I’ve shared doesn’t mean anything. The propaganda I attack are blanket propaganda without sources. 

So, yea, you’re right. I’m angry at the stupidity of our nation. "
310,dsqhju6,"The woman was speaking in a heavy foreign accent. She got into a fight with someone who was wearing a hijab. If this is the standard, no one can get into a fight with a muslim woman without it being a federal hate crime case.

We have no idea what preceded this incident or the motive of the woman involved... but the fact that she was speaking in broken English and looks vaguely arab/persian/mediterranean goes very much against the picture you're trying to paint.

Muslim women are extremely judgemental (they think we're fucking animals and that our women are whores). The way that vaguely foreign woman was dressed, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if she provoked the attack by calling her a whore or a traitor (for wearing the Canada shirt)."
311,driebjm,"A few points:

&gt;Can you read minds, have you done studies?

I personally know several muslim girls living in the US who have talked about what I said. I don't need to read minds or conduct studies to make the statement that there are others like them. They're not the only 4 girls in the world in this position. I didn't claim that *most* muslim women are in their position, I said *many* are.

Secondly, please inform me where I attacked them. I merely said that many females are pressured into wearing them by their families- and that they aren't all doing it purely because *they* want to. That's not an attack by any stretch of the imagination. I really don't care what they wear. The only thing I have a problem with is when they're pushed into wearing something that they don't actually want to.

&gt;The PRIMARY targets for Islamophobe nutfucks is young girls wearing it.

Just to give this back to you a bit, do you read minds or do you have a study supporting that claim? THAT'S a significant claim- knowing which specific demographics are the *primary* targets of harassment.

&gt;You people are so fucking blind to the irony it isn't even funny. You don't give a flying fuck about freedom.

Thank you for your unsolicited and unfair judgments, but I'm advocating that people to be able to do what they want, without dissenting pressures guilting them into doing otherwise. I'm talking about a completely separate point. I'm in no way saying that girls ought to be harassed or endangered, yet your response is trying to indicate that I want that. That's totally incorrect and unfair.

&gt;If you did, you'd be advocating for setting up help and support systems for girls being abused and forced to wear it, instead of oppressing an entire population by banning them from covering their fucking hair. What the fuck.

...My whole point is that many girls are forced to wear them, and they should do what *they* personally want. Apparently, by mentioning this, you somehow interpreted this as the advocation of legislation oppressing an entire population by banning them from covering their hair? That's quite the jump.

But what do I know? Apparently I'm just an ignorant white male in my 20s, so whatever I say has no merit. Good thing you were here to clear things up."

313,douap18,"&gt;  You would learn that there are Muslims who go through the motions

I know that already. One of my best friends from highschool is Muslim, and he drinks booze and eats pork. He also fasts for Ramadan. None of that means that other Muslims are the same, and that religious protections don't matter.

. Did you ever think that its possible many Muslim women are secretly happy to have a law that allows them to remove the niqab more often? 

Given that all the evidence is that Canadian woman wearing the niqab do so by choice, no.

&gt; Think about some of these things before you make sweeping assumptions about their beliefs and their plight.

When it comes to religious freedoms, it is what each individual believes that matters. So long as one Muslim woman believes her faith requires her to wear a niqab, bill 62 is an attack on religious freedom."
314,dnujl6r,"
###Here is my best summary:

Mahamad Accord, with the Edmonton Coalition for Human Rights, said he heard from one Muslim woman who was hospitalized Monday after she had a bottle smashed on her head while riding the LRT. An Edmonton human rights advocate says Muslim women are being attacked following a spree of violence linked to a Somali man on the weekend. Accord gave his condolences to the victims of the attack, but also said he is concerned that the attacks against Muslim women Monday are just “the tip of the iceberg.”. He called the attack “unacceptable and inhumane,” adding that Edmonton’s Somali and Muslim communities are concerned and saddened, and praying for a fast recovery for the victims. Jibril Ibrahim, President of the Somali Canadian Cultural Society Of Edmonton, said the Somali community is “shocked” and condemns the attack “in the strongest terms.” "
315,dobxkn9,"&gt; You realize that just because a character has become a racist/fascist icon doesn't mean all incarnations of it are racist/fascist, right? This is why the author is trying to reclaim it.

&gt;Of course they do.

Not an argument.

&gt;I'm not moving the goalposts, I'm explaining how your analogy could work, and why it doesn't the way it's presented.

Yes you were, I was talking about current emojis, you shifted it and said if they made their own. 

&gt;I'm not downplaying it, I'm saying the SPLC isn't responsible for the attacks.

Speaking in general.

&gt;It's hate when you try to legislate to take away their rights.

Nobody is taking away their rights, try and back up your claims for once maybe.

&gt;It doesn't ""stick up for Islam"", it denounced Islamophobia.

By labelling people against the violence and terrible practices of islam in order to discredit them. :thinking:

Sounds like sticking up for it to me. 

&gt;just like some Christians are hateful.

Christians don't toss gays off rooftops or shoot up nightclubs. 

&gt;Except that wouldn't happen because I'm not a hate group. Furthermore, if antifa were to attack, it would still not be the responsibility of the SPLC.

So if I labeled you as a hate speaker and post your address on a map on my website that is known to people who use violence to advance a political ideology and come for you, I'm scott free? Good to know.

&gt;I never said they were, but them not being perfect wasn't your initial charge.

They're far from perfect is the point yet they're in the authority to label people. If you can't see it here and now than its clear you don't want to because it suits you.

&gt;I disagree. Ben Shapiro is a hate speaker. He's also a climate change denier, and Islamophobe.

How is arguing against the proposition of manmade climate change make someone a hate speaker? :thinking:

He doesn't fear islam, so no. 

&gt;You don't know what I know about Islam or not, and the fact that she is Somali is immaterial. You can decry FGM without being anti-Islam. Most Muslim women are not victims of FGM.

How do you know this? Would be nice if you provided some links in any of your comments.

&gt;Irrelevant to the discussion.

She verbally attacked the speaker and SPLC defended her so yes shes relevent to the discussion. **Just because you don't like facts, doesn't mean you can just hand wave them away.**



I have yet to see any.

&gt;I have make salient arguments, and demonstrated how yours were incorrect.

&gt;&gt;handwaving
&gt;That's not what I'm doing, so that point is moot.

You literally hand waved away on the last point. 

&gt;Islam isn't a hateful religion. Some Muslims are hateful, just like some Christians are hateful. Attack the individuals spreading fundamentalist interpretation of religions, not religions themselves.

It is against gays. It isn't ""some"" if the government backs violence against gays. Anyone familiar with [Sunni vs Shiites](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/14132) will know muslims kill each other more than anyone else over religious differences. 

&gt;Quran (2:216) - ""Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.""

&gt;Quran (3:56) - ""As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.""

Linda Sauser who is a vehement muslim tweeted violence against her opposition.

I am respectful, I was just hoping it was on your approved list of lefty sources, so please watch your tone and respect the rules of the sub, thanks.

&gt;I did, and it certainly doesn't support your charge against SPLC.

Clearly you didn't.

&gt;Yes, there is.

If we're playing a game, it's pretty clear I have the higher score of actually citing my sources vs your 0. 

&gt;No. They're a much bigger problem than those imagined propaganda organizations of yours.

""nu uh, its you who's wrong."" Again, not an argument.

You just said you wanted more sources and now you say you won't read the comment, lol *okay.*

It's too bad you're unwilling to leave entrenched from your leftist position because you have some sort of loyalty to an organization that labels people.

316,dmolhku,"Everybody who thinks women and children and victims of islam needs to realize they are every bit as indoctrinated as the men and are carrying out jihad in their own way. muslim children perpetually attack non-muslim classmates, and the women teach their children that non-muslim women are trash and targets."
317,dl6u6g0,"From the standpoint of women’s rights, there are strong parallels as well as sharp contrasts with similarly charged debates in the past. To appreciate that, one needs to recall earlier debates and histories.

It may, for example, be important to recall that through the 1940s and 1950s there was a section of Hindu men and women who opposed all efforts to reform laws relating to the Hindu community, every inch of the way. These included the Sri Sankaracharya Swamigai and Sri Kanchi Kamakothi Pithadhipati, Kumbakonam, as well as leaders of the Hindu Maha Sabha, such as N.C. Chatterjee and Jankibai Joshi, the general secretary of the All India Hindu Mahila Sabha. Joshi repeatedly wrote to the viceroys – Linlithgow and Wavell – to oppose the recommendations of the Hindu Law Committee and then again in 1949-50, women from the organisation voiced their opposition to the proposed Hindu Code Bill (HCB) and its specific clauses, while Chatterjee led the attack in the legislative assembly. The enactment of the HCB was opposed by M.S. Golwalkar, the RSS, the Hindu Mahasabha, the Bharatiya Jan Sangh and the Ram Rajya Parishad and their representatives in parliament.  They were in fact the predecessors of the BJP, which is presently championing the cause of Muslim women. Opposition to the reforms came from several quarters, as is well known, and the tension between Rajendra Prasad and Jawaharlal Nehru on this issue is well documented.

The arguments then rang a familiar tone – Hindu Law is religious law; it is not enacted by any legislative assembly, therefore no ‘amendment’ can be brought in the legislative assembly; those supporting the HCB do not represent the Hindus, for example, Renuka Ray, a Brahmo, ‘is not qualified to represent Hindu women in the assembly’. Nor should the All India Women’s Conference, one of the foremost organisations of this period, be allowed to have any say in the matter since it ‘is a body the membership of which is open to all women, irrespective of caste and creed’. There were others who argued that on any ‘code or law affecting Hindus’ personal interest, members of no other community should be allowed to vote’

The recent focus on the plight of Muslim women has many characters and sub plots as well as sub texts – Muslim men are merciless human beings, who divorce their wives at will; the Muslim leadership is horribly patriarchal; Muslim women are in dire need of support, especially when the doors are shut on them with not an instant to prepare for a whole life time lived without the necessary support systems, including who takes responsibility for the everyday needs of the wife and the children. There is undoubtedly great truth in the story.

What is not recognised is that if you remove the word Muslim from each of these sentences, all this is true for the majority of women in India. This undoubtedly includes the vast majority of Hindu women – many of whom who live every day of their lives in fear and uncertainty, despite the enactment of several progressive laws to address these vulnerabilities in the last hundred years. The home, which is supposed to be the woman’s place as per the ideologues of almost all the religious communities, is also the site of unchecked cruelty, oppression, and the brutal suppression of rights as a citizen on a daily basis. The fact remains that Muslim men in India do not have the sole proprietary rights over patriarchy nor over ideologies which perpetuate inequalities and social discrimination.

319,djymw7q,"Why are you pretending like I asked about your opinion? If this is how you think, great. 
But I hate to break it to you, but not all ex-Muslims think like you.

There are some ex-Muslims (mostly women) who believe Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab, despite Muslim women stating themselves that they love wearing the hijab.

Some ex-Muslims (again mostly women) who think emotionally who are still in the state of mind where they think the hijab represent nothing but oppression. That is understable considering they were probably forced to wear the hijab, but what they fail to understand is that not all Muslim women were forced to wear the hijab. 

&gt; never said that. or implied that. why do you straw man? is it because of your logic?

Then please explain what you meant by this: 

'You should wear the hijab in the west, because there are sexually hungry men who can attack you for not wearing the hijab''
(wtf)

Are you actually implying that Muslim women wear the hijab to only cover themselves from ''sexually hungry men'' If you think Muslim women wear the hijab solely for this reason, then I think you need to educate yourself about the hijab.


&gt; Then they should get that.

It's not as easy as it sounds, especially when ex-Muslims defend the digusting acts of islamophobic people. There's a differene between Muslim girls who are being forced to wear the hijab, and Muslims girl who love to wear the hijab. But it seems as though some ex-Muslims don't know the differene (mostly ex-Muslim women).


&gt; No we don't. stop presuming.

I think you meant assuming. Anyway, no one is assuming. Obivously not all ex.Muslims claim Muslim girls are lying, but some do to further their ex-Muslims agenda. 


&gt; The only people who don't take is seriously are emotionally charged, sentimental cowards who can't face intellectual reason. Those who deny death. Those who are so greedy and eager to keep on living they are wasting the only life they get.

Well you have to udnerstand one thing: just because you think Islam is evil, oppressive, and violent, not everyone thinks the same way, including westerns and the rest of the world.

Some ex-Muslims fail to understand this. You actually proved my point by calling those who don't agree with your views ''sentimental cowards who can't face intellectual reason''. You are being hostile against atheists and westerners because you thought they automatically agreed with your anti-Islamic views because they don't agree with Islam.

320,divk9by,"A lot of Muslim feminists (not all of course) have the conversation in their own community when it comes Islamic-specific misogyny but don't want and don't think all of those outside the community are effective allies because a lot of time those who are ""standing up for Muslim women"" are just as misogynistic themselves in their own communities and are really just finding another way to attack Muslims. Women's rights are usually won by women fighting in their own communities. No one gave US women their right to vote. They didn't need a foreign entity's support to do it. "

322,djaezf7,"exactly.

it's weird to me that people are so afraid of nuance on this thread.

323,djbk7ox,"Not necessarily. To preface this, I had a hard time coming to terms with this too. I consider myself a feminist and I thought why would muslim women want to wear something to cover themselves and be modest just for a future husband? Isn't that being opressed? But thats not the situation. 

In the muslim religion, when practiced correctly and respectfully, does NOT cast out a woman if she decides not to wear a hijab. But, as with many religions, there are individual people who interpret it different and will shun or disparage a woman who decides not to wear it. Think of some christians being okay with gay marriage due to practicing tolerance, but others hate it completely because the same religion. They just interpret the bible differently. 

As for the case of being modest for women. That is a big part of the muslim religion for women, and like every other religion and its followers, many people stray from some key elements [think of mormons and coffee or christians and divorce, etc.] So its definitely a person-to-person case on how strictly they follow this. Orthodox muslim women are even discouraged from wearing makeup as its seen tempting, but if you go on instagram or youtube you can see a bunch of Muslim women make up artists! 

Basically I'm trying to say that its just another culture and religion. I abhor any aspect of religion that puts down a certain group of people- don't get me wrong! but the simple act of wearing a hijab- or not! is not inherently bad, in my opinion. I hope I made some sense, and you don't see this as an attack, because like I said, I used to think the same thing as you did :) "
324,dh2jm6e,"These kinds of articles from Reuters and such, are biased. It's a kind of cultural attack and cultural chauvinism. It's denigrating a people and their cultural practice. Female circumcision is just like male circumcision, it's not something hideous or a ""mutilation"". Even the term is loaded: ""female genital mutilation"". Why are the male circumcision not called ""male genital mutilation"" then ? Why the hostile labeling ? 

Female circumcision has a value to them. To them, it's a form of tradition, culture, and a religious act, to symbolize modesty and such. This is their meaning and their ownership. Outsiders should not assign a different meaning to it like it's a kind of barbaric act. That is racist and chauvinistic.

Granted that small kids are not able to consent, but the parents generally are able to make decisions on their behalf, on what they think is the best for their children.

Some Malay Muslim women who had female circumcision then do the same thing to their daughters. Is it true that thousands of Malay Muslim women are sadistic idiots who torture their daughters ? Use your intuition. What is really happening here ? 

What gives Westerners the right to denigrate and make derogatory remarks on a people's culture ?

What is the objective measurement that we can use to say that this practice is good or not good ? 

Since it is subjective, why are Malay Muslim women deemed stupid idiots, primitive barbaric people ? Why is one interpretation more correct than another interpretation ? Why are outsiders invading and imposing their interpretation on someone else ?

You see what is happening here ?"

328,g0ia2q0,"&gt; Besides, your issue with organised religion doesn’t mean that Muslim women are forced into wearing the hijab? Some parents are shitty, and they can express that through different forms of abuse, using religion among other things as a tool.

I disagree. I believe that religion can and does make otherwise normal people and parents abusive. People act according to what they believe. So if parents believe it is their responsibility to beat their children if they disobey their religion, they will do so. That's why ISIS is a thing- they believe that it is their divine responsibility to do what they do. They're motivated by zeal for Allah and the promise of paradise. In their magazine they state they hate the west because of our freedom, atheism, homosexuality, etc. That also explains why people bomb abortion clinics, etc. etc.


&gt; Please don’t assume that all women who wear the hijab were forced into it. That’s wrong and grossly misogynistic.



I'm not saying that, but I do believe that hijabi women who grew up in Muslim households are doing so because their parents drilled it into their skulls as children."
329,fvfnv2p,"If you are implying Muslim women are safer under the kuffar then ok... stats don't lie the highest porn consumption is USA, the most rampant rape is USA, the sexualised society is USA, the same country that bombed, is bombing and wants bomb muslims, the same country that family unit is destroyed and economy structure that forces women out of their first and best hijab their homes to work shoulder to shoulder with men. I rather fight on a Muslim land than travel as a refugee without honor seeking asylum in kuffar country that raped Iraqis and destroyed Libya. A Muslim woman belongs in her home raising her family.

330,fxgxxd5,"The study you shared says the opposite of what you think.  Money quote: “Taken together, these results *support* some of the tenets of objectification theory with a sample of U.S. Muslim women, point to the importance of internalization of dominant cultural standards of beauty within that framework, and suggest the utility of considering individual differences in wearing the hijab among U.S. Muslim women.” The study literally says that even hijabis internalize their being objectified in spite of being veiled and that it varies based on individual factors meaning no generalization can be drawn; nowhere does the article say what you assert. 

It is absolutely not scientifically proven that hijab keeps women safe; hijabis get street harassed just as much as other women, especially in Muslim countries. Rape is not any less common in Muslim countries, tho consumption of porn is significantly higher. Forcing a woman to cover reduces her to a sexual object too, and forces her to internalize the male gaze she must cater to. 

The other study you shared just says that women who wear non western clothes are less concerned with maintaining western standards of beauty like thinness. Well no shit a woman who maintains nonwestern standards of beauty will conform to that standard and not western ones. And the sky is also blue. That doesn’t mean Muslim women are happier, it just means they are pressured to cover up their bodies while westerners are pressured to be thin, but both groups are forced to internalize the gaze of their harassers. Islam solves nothing by deleting women’s appearance. 

And no Muslims are not the happiest ppl on earth , lmfao where do you guys get this stuff? The study on the benefits of belief in oneness apply to literally all religions and spiritual systems and is in no way proof that Islam is any better or different than any other religion that gives followers a sense of oneness. It’s funny you would share studies that don’t actually support your argument but illustrate that Muslim women are forced to Muslim standards of modesty rather than western standards of beauty, and that practicing basically any religion whatsoever has some psychological benefits. And after all your citations, you fell back on “because Allah commands it therefore it’s right” bc logic only applies to Islam when it suits you. 

It’s also ironic you would cite psychological studies concerning happiness and well being when Islam offers followers no such thing but rewards after death.  So whether Muslims are happy and Muslim women are confident has little to no bearing on whether Allah exists. 

Also, you didn’t even respond to the OP who asked why Muslims have to deny our reasons for leaving and make up their own dismissive reasons for us. You come back with hijab makes women confident and Islam makes people happy. Wtf does that have to do with anything? 

This forum is for us to vent to each other and apostates from other religions, not debate religious apologists like you. It’s sad that you need to affirm your faith by debating us when we are over here commiserating about our frustration with the actual Muslims in our families and lives. You must know that no one here will be convinced by your arguments, so it’s baffling to me why you guys bombard us here. I can only assume that you need to debate us in order to maintain your faith to keep proving to yourself that you’re right. If you’re so certain in your religion, great, go practice it and leave us alone. 

We all leave the religion after thorough research and especially after debating people like you, even the expert authorities who affirm the parts of Islam we find most repugnant. You engaging us actually deepens our decision to leave, so you might be doing the opposite of what you hope. What do you think you could possibly tell us that we haven’t already heard? 

I used to be like you, bringing all my intellectual resources to defend the most absurd parts of Islam. Ironically, those debates themselves convinced me Islam was wrong. If you don’t want the same to happen to you, I suggest not throwing stones in glass houses."

- Because the Church doesn't tell us to strap bombs to ourselves and detonate them in public places (radical Islam and other radicalized groups of other beliefs), it doesn't teach us to take up arms and head off to far away lands to kill those with different beliefs (radical Islam, the Crusades), the Church doesn't instruct us to round up those with other beliefs (Muslim women are being raped in what are effectively prison camps in India right now, Hitler and the Nazis, the various groups that have run Amish/Mennonites/Anabaptist groups out of country after country). Instead it's ""someone damaged your place of worship/killed your members, tell us how we can help you, no strings attached"".

After all, under Islam, each of these statements has been true since the time of Muhammad, in the 7th century CE:

* Women have their own legal identity, married or single - true only as of the late 19th-century in Western society - look up [coverture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverture) as one example. Also the paterfamilias principle, which governed most Continental law until the early-mid 20th Century;

* Married Muslim women are permitted to find gainful employment if they wish - as contrasting example: Until 1975, a woman in the British Geological Service who married was automatically fired from her position;

* Married Muslim women retain any property they bring to the marriage, as well as any increase to that property, and are both permitted and expected to manage that property either directly or through agents of their choice. In the UK, men took ownership of all their wives' property, until the 1882 Married Womens' Property Act permitted married women to own property. In the US, it varied by State, but was typically mid-19th century;

* No-fault divorce can be initiated by either partner - only true since 1975 in Australia, 1970 in California, 2010(!) in New York, 1986 in Canada, 1969 in the UK and 1975 in France;

* Women are able to give testimony in court, to which judges *must* assign at least some probative value. This was not the case throughout the West for much of history - a woman's testimony had *no* value in a courtroom until 1908 in Belgium, 1877 in Italy, 1897 in France and so on;

The list goes on. Islam *today* is backwards with respect to womens' rights, this cannot be seriously argued against. But that is  a comparatively recent development; for most of its existence, Islam was one of the most progressive systems in the world for women to live under.

The same is true of religious tolerance - at the time when Western rulers called for pogroms to erase the debts they owed minority (Jewish) bankers, Islamic lands were receiving those same bankers and making them court officials. When Isabella of Spain expelled all the Jews from her realm (1492), the great majority of them took refuge in Islamic lands - because they could expect better treatment there than anywhere else. Yes, Islam has (again) stood still, or even regressed, while the West has advanced; however, it is far from a given that this will continue.

***

I guess that what I'm saying is this: There is nothing, or at most very little, about Western social and legal values that is *inherently* fair, or decent, or just. We have learned to (re)interpret them through a more fair, and decent, and just, perspective over the past century and change. And that reflects well upon us as people and as a society; we should justly feel proud of the Western world's advances in the areas of impartial justice, the rights of traditionally-excluded groups and the advancement of prosperity.

This is possible for Islam too; do they not have a right to at least make the attempt, without us ramming our own (very foreign) values systems down their throats wholesale, bombing their countries willy-nilly, and generally acting as if we know what's best for them?"
350,e84b5jm,"... people care more about the Saudi's involvement in the murder of a single journalist then they do: Saudi's involvement in 911, the continued bombing of Yemen, and even the way feminists ignore the way Muslim women are treated.

The fake outrage is real. "
351,e8kodtt,"&gt;I mean i could point to black males being overepresented in similar statistics 

black males eh?

yeah black and white males are busy involved in crime far more than black and white women are.

 How come when they talk about youth, they are actually referring exclusively to males?

 Black women aren't shooting the place up are they?  Hardly any Muslim women are involved in suicide bombings are they?

 What is wrong with males that makes them so inclined to smash the place up?

 I think idle hands are the cause of a lot of problems and that is what men are, idle, bone idle and they want it easy, and they are the protected sex and they rely on women to protect them.

Male students in first year university spend far more of their time in the gym, playing sport, watching porn, fapping fapping fapping, partying, guzzling down litres of booze and playing video games much more than their female counterparts.

Meanwhile female students spend much of their time in student clubs and groups, doing housework, childcare whilst also volunteering to help groups who are less able than themselves on top of their studying because they have a great work ethic and they are determined to get good grades.

In other words, women work very hard applying themselves conscientiously to their studies all the time while busy doing other work as well.

 Whilst male students are happy to piss around doing exactly as they please and generally enjoying themselves, playing and gaming around having a real good time.

Cos you know boys will be boys and will take full of advantage of getting away with murder and not for them is housework or child care important or helping other less able than themselves out, no there is always someone else there to do that for them, always someone else there to run around after them, picking up all their squalid shit.

Men can really apply themselves to partying and fapping, cos it's something that really matters to them and as long as they can see the point of something, they will get stuck right in.

And in their second year of studying, these male students get into a panic because they haven't applied themselves to it, like they applied themselves to drinking and having fun.

Women are always there to pick up the pieces of the mess men leave behind

352,e7m508g,"Don't forget they're super feminist chuds when it comes to how oppressed islamic women are. It's super important to free islamic women from the oppression of clothes, but you know its alright if Israel wants to oppress a few with things like bombs and napalm and snipers and genocide and unlawful occupation. It's okay if they commit a few war crimes, everyone knows the muslims are the baddies."
353,e26icyw,"Lol what world do you live in?? Christians killing each other in Yugoslavia over Catholic vs Orthodox old divides, in Ireland over Catholic vs Protestant, In Chechnya we killed them for being Muslim, fundies in US bombing abortion clinics, in Myanmar fuckin' *Buddhists* killing Muslims for Chrissake. I could write a VERY long list of all the religions causing violence. 

Islam just happens to be where oil be at, and where there is oil, there is US causing instability. Indonesia isn't having major wars because guess what, despite having more Muslims than anyone, they don't have oil. Magic.

Sharia courts are non-binding, UK also has a lot of Jewish arbitration courts too. I could have the court of my dick if I wanted to. As long as both parties consent to arbitration by my dick, it's kosher. Muslim women are brainwashed by a misogynistic religion, but that's their problem. Women who voted for Trump also got brainwashed and did things against their interest, very hard for me to understand how vapid of a cunt you have to be to vote for a ~~Muslim rapist~~ I'm sorry, what religion is Trump? I meant to say whatever Trump's religion is, that they voted for a rapist that believes in whatever religion he does."
354,e2h83yf,"Tips for those who don’t understand why most parents disown their kids because of love and other stuff:

In the Arabian/Muslim world honor and reputation is a really big thing, people care about their reputation more then they care about their children’s feelings, because people would talk bad things about your family and people’s opinion of us is far more important then our opinion of us, mix that shitty tradition with extreme and religious muslims and you get an atom bomb, Its very toxic to live with those kind of parents, some of them don’t hesitate when beating their children for reasons such as: it will make them stronger, or this will make them learn a lesson.

And those hardcore religious Muslims hold dumb things very sacred, like your mother’s/sister’s name, just saying body parts is a curse there.

In Europe/America I tend to notice that muslim women are more hardcore and less open then men here, specially if they immigrated here, men often open up with time but the women tend not to.

Anyways hope this helped explaining things 

(Note: this was not intended to belittle Islam or all Muslims, its an explanation of what some Muslims think and do and why so many bad things happen to poor kids who have no say in this, and it wasn’t meant to be Islamophobic, or sexist, sorry if you took it that way, but I’m sure muslims will understand what I’m saying)

(Note-2: This is also can be found in any religious culture/family not only Muslims, but it is more often in Muslim countries)"
355,e14jioz,"This is the type of thing I think of when people say its geo-politics that cause Islam violence. Apparently Islamic women are really putting the hurt on Muslims because they are catching a lot of shit and it can't POSSIBLY be because Islam is inherently violent in its teachings.

I wonder what those women carpet bombed to deserve genital mutilation. Or what civilians they killed to justify public execution. "
356,dys3hxl,"I loved the editor's note read it if you can spare a minute or two







&gt;One of the reactions we often get when we post such news is – but such crimes happen everywhere, why single out a particular community?

&gt;Yes, it is true that such heinous crimes happen everywhere across the world. A jilted husband / lover killing his wife / partner has sadly become a relatively common occurrence, aided and abetted by modern pop culture where young minds are constantly bombarded with messages of “love &amp; sex = progressiveness + modernity” through music, movies, TV and social media.

&gt;The epidemic of sexual violence &amp; broken families needs a wholesome response by balancing young minds and talking about equal importance of the 4 purusharthas i.e. goals of life – dharma (moral duty), artha (economic prosperity), kama (love or pleasure) and moksha (spiritual liberation). But we digress.

&gt;The reason why HinduPost puts extra focus on highlighting cases involving Muslim men committing acts of violence (physical, sexual etc) against Hindu women, is because this aspect is completely missing from mainstream discourse. While the gender issues afflicting contemporary Hindu society – female foeticide, sexual violence, gender discrimination – are widely discussed and debated, as they should be, there is complete silence on the topic of how non-Muslim women are objectified in eyes of conservative Muslims who believe in the absolute supremacy of Islam.

&gt;No social scientist in Bharat has ever bothered to study how young men who grow up being tutored that any woman not covered from head to toe in a burqa or who at least covers her head with a hijab, is like an ‘uncovered lollipop’ and hence likely to attract flies; who are taught that converting and marrying a kafir woman is a divine deed which will guarantee a spot in jannat (heaven) and also furthers the cause of the ummah by increasing Muslim demography; or told that as per scripture a kafir (non-Muslim) woman can be seized as a ‘spoil of war’ and used like a sex slave.

&gt;Not one MSM commentator has bothered to ask why it is that we rarely hear of cases involving Hindu men accused of grooming / raping / forcefully converting a Muslim girl? Why is the data of such crimes so skewed towards Muslim men committing crimes against Hindu women, when Bharat is 79.4% Hindu and just 14.2% Muslim?

&gt;Our liberal-secular elites pretend that religious indoctrination plays no part in this, despite criminals like Muhammad Shafi from Kerala themselves acknowledging it – Shafi posed as a Hindu NRI doctor on marriage websites to dupe and sexually assault over 30 Hindu women…when questioned by investigators about his choice of victims, he said “it is a sin to molest a Muslim girl.”

&gt;One look at her photos and Mahima Mahadeo Vitole appears to be a free-spirited, confident girl – the fact that she was just 18 when she married Wasim Taj Mohammed Pathan and shortly thereafter decided to separate from him, shows her independent streak. But what she probably didn’t know was the lifelong conditioning of her husband, who must have been under immense peer pressure to ‘control’ his kafir wife and make her live like a ‘good Muslim’ girl.

&gt;The Bollywood crowd which acts as the example-setters for such ‘love triumphs all’ relations will not shed any tears for Mahima. The yuppie crowd which is pushing our youth into ever riskier behaviour &amp; experimental lifestyles, will also sweep Mahima’s death under the carpet as ‘routine crime’. But, given the right set of circumstances and the secularly acceptable identity of victim &amp; perpetrator, these rent-a-cause activists will be out once again with their placards.

&gt;Someone must mourn the likes of Mahima Mahadeo Vitole, which is what we at HinduPost are trying to do….we hope that she gets justice, and that her painful death is able to open the eyes of more &amp; more youth."
357,dyw8e01,Reddit adores Islam. While in my country there is a bomb in church today and many people are jailed for blasphemy. But the world does not care as long as the victim is not a Muslim. Reddit only cares if Muslim women are forbidden to wear hijab.
358,dz81d5n,"Yeah I'm going to have to see some sources on that one. Boko Haram do not by any manner of means leave girls be. Muslim women are spared from battle but they are captured to be wives or used as sex/domestic slaves. Christian women are often tortured before they are killed. They now also favour using women as suicide bomber as they are more expendable. 

The use of child soldiers is totally abhorrant, reducing a boys life to being some pawn with a gun in some war they don't understand is a tragedy. However to say that men suffer more than women under these guys I don't think is true. I think everyone in society suffers under these bastards.

359,dwxj6dw,"&gt;&gt; I don't care that it's private property.
&gt;
&gt;So you literally think that their property rights don't matter because they're Muslim. Nice standard to set, [there are a few people who really liked this idea in 1938](http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%203850.pdf) (page 9).
&gt;

Damn you're dishonest. Yes they can apply to do that. Yes people can oppose. 
They can do, I don't think they should. 

&gt;
&gt;&gt; That doesn't make enclaves a good thing. I have example why. There are many more.
&gt;
&gt;I think the fact that you just say ""I have many example"" without actually showing them says a lot about your debating abilities.

Gave an example. 

&gt;&gt;Why would Muslims who come here be vastly different then the ones in Britain?
&gt;
&gt;Well aside from the fact that there are 2 billion Muslims on Earth from literally dozens of countries. The real problem here is that you think British Muslims are nasty and your opinion is no different for Canadian Muslims. I really don't have the time to explain how other people *are in fact human beings, capable of being nice and not evil.* As such, the only real explanation to this is that you don't know any Muslim people and get your ideas regarding them from conservative media - telling you that they all want to destroy Western society, bomb us, etc.
&gt;


You're so dishonest. You obviously don't know even the basic facts about the Muslim world. Do you think Muslims like gays? What about atheists? What about apostates? The Koran calls for killing them all. 


&gt;&gt;  They follow the same stupid book and come from the same stupid culture.
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, just like the Puritans that founded America, right? Or the Acadians, or the Huguenot, or Scottish Presbyterians - *they all follow the same stupid book and come from the same stupid culture, right?*

I'm sorry, do Muslims not follow the Koran? And yes, Christians who follow the Bible are not at bad as Muslims who follow the Koran. 

&gt;
&gt;&gt; You also ignore that originally they wanted it to be Muslim only... 
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, they don't anymore. John A. McDonald originally wanted Canada to be white people only - if we can accept him changing his mind I think we can use the same standard here.


Lol prove they changed their mind. They've just said they won't, but they own our, so they choose who lives there... 

&gt;
&gt;&gt; It's not long before we have sharia courts so Muslim men can beat and abuse their wives and children and go to sharia courts where women are told to be better wives if they don't want to get beaten. (these exist in the UK already)
&gt;
&gt;(citation needed) - I get that you're referring to extrajudicial family councils, those aren't 'courts' - that is organized crime (extrajudicial) and should be treated as such. A Sharia court would have to pass all 3 legislative bodies (which would find it contrary to the CCHRF because it is). In order to pass such legislative bodies, you would need fundamentalist Muslims in a majority of seats (338 in Commons and 105 in senate). Doing this would requiring winning elections in at least 170 constituencies - literally tens of millions of people.

That's bullshit. You're just making that up. ""extra judicial family councils"" big brother would be proud. These are ""councils"" that follow sharia. Allowed in Britain despite not having majority fundamental Muslims. 

&gt;
&gt;This is also predicated on the idea that every single Muslim is an extremist wife beater - this notion is fucking ridiculous. Do you think every Christian observes the sabbath and doesn't eat shellfish?


OK. You're ignorant. You think Muslim men have the same attitude towards women that euro men do? No. In fact non Muslim women are even lost than that. That's why the Muslim rape gangs in Britain raped white girls. 

&gt;&gt; Ethnic or religious enclaves are a bad idea. Look at Richmond bc, there's basically no English anywhere. If your don't speak Chinese you won't understand what anything is. The saving grace is that Chinese people don't come from a violent fanatical totalitarian religion that teaches that nonbelievers should be killed. 
&gt;
&gt;20 million people died as a result of the cultural revolution. Also comparing a single hi-rise development to an entire municipality is fucking absurd - just like your ideas of Richmond. Take a walk down Hastings and let me know which one is a bigger blight on Van.
   
WOW. Richmond didn't appear overnight.... Ffs. 



&gt;&gt; Just watch, if this is built, and ends up majority Muslim, the crime rate in the area will go up. 
&gt;
&gt;They have owned the property (60 acres IIRC) since 1994 and it is been a Muslim-dominated neighbourhood since as long. Your argument that the crime rate will go up is made in ignorance of the fact that there are already a lot of Muslims living there and the crime rate is average.
 
Yet it's true in Germany... And Sweden... And the UK.... And France.... And on and on. 


&gt;&gt; It happens everywhere in the world that Muslims exist.
&gt;
&gt;Except Bathurst, apparently. Or a million and one other places that you don't care about cus they don't fit your bigoted narrative that all Muslims are violent - it's called confirmation bias.

Jesus Christ. You dumb. When  says Muslims, they don't mean ALL. you have a child's mind. 

By the way, Newcastle, Telford, Rotherham... All had Muslim rape gangs operating for years. Thousands of girls raped while authorities ignored it. 

&gt;&gt; Anti semitism on the rise in Canada.. And they blame the far right. Want to know who the most anti semitic group in the world is? Ya, Muslims.

It's reductionist and stupid to argue that every Muslim is extremist. I used Christianity as an analogue to show that most religions have numerous sects that disagree on a lot of theological issues. Furthermore I would say that most adhering Christians are just as zealous as most adhering Muslims - just go to an abortion clinic and talk to the protesters. 

&gt; That's bullshit. You're just making that up. ""extra judicial family councils"" big brother would be proud. These are ""councils"" that follow sharia. Allowed in Britain despite not having majority fundamental Muslims.

Okay well clarify what you mean by 'Sharia courts' then. Furthermore, show me a 'Sharia court' that has legal authority - like ratified and appointed legal authority.

&gt; WOW. Richmond didn't appear overnight.... Ffs.

So what you're saying is... they're not comparable. Thanks, me too.

&gt; Yet it's true in Germany... And Sweden... And the UK.... And France.... And on and on.

Okay. I'll go slow. You think that all-Muslim neighbourhoods have high crime rates. The Muslims have lived there for 24 years. In that time, crime rate has not gone up. If this all-Muslim neighbourhood has existed for 24 years, why hasn't the crime rate gone up?

&gt; Jesus Christ. You dumb. When says Muslims, they don't mean ALL. you have a child's mind.

You think that all Muslims are criminals, those are literally your words. I'm just pointing out that the example that we're talking about (Bathurst) refutes your ideas in every way.

&gt; By the way, Newcastle, Telford, Rotherham... All had Muslim rape gangs operating for years. Thousands of girls raped while authorities ignored it.

Again, Muslims have been there for 24 years... no rape gangs.

&gt; Are your fucking serious? Because Google is so hard to use. 

Literally the first sentence of that article: ""Antisemitism in the Arab world has increased greatly in modern times, for many reasons: the breakdown of the Ottoman Empire and traditional Islamic society; European influence, brought about by **Western imperialism and Arab Christians; Nazi propaganda**; resentment over Jewish nationalism (see Zionism); and the rise of Arab nationalism.

I never said that. Did I fucking say that? Did I say the words ""Muslims are not/cannot be antisemitic""? Last time I checked, that's not what I fucking said. You have a real problem with looking at words and understanding them, so let me go slow again; Muslims are not the most anti-semitic group on earth, it is generally regarded that the Nazis take the #1 spot for that. See your own source where it says that Arab antisemitism was in part ""brought about by Western imperialism and Arab Christians; Nazi propaganda""

Do you know what that means? That means that Arabs literally were influenced by the Nazis in their antisemitism.

362,drw1ciz,"No the issue is why is that *your* issue. **Its not your place to say and choose what is oppression for them.** How many muslim women are out there saying anything about what they wear? I'm pretty sure they are more concerned with why the west has occupied by their land and bombed it killing their loved ones. Its orientalism and oppressive to act as though the western way is the only way. They don't have to take off anything

Y'all pretend you give a damn about their well-being but that shit is creepy as fuck ""are women wearing less conservative in some aspects?"" The country has been having a war and you're asking if women are showing more skin? This shit is disgusting. 

Its their choice, let them be the ones to speak up about it being an issue. Its not your place. The women in the west are oppressed, worry about the oppressive shit that happens in your own country. "
363,dr3jxx5,"Seriously? I've not said Muslim women are or aren't oppressed you mansplaining ass. I'm saying YOU don't get to speak for women and especially not Muslim women. You have been saying how they essentially deserve that oppression because they haven't ""fought their way out"". You need to shut the fuck up. I'm starting to agree with the theory you're actually false flagging to make those of us that are against taking away Muslim women's choices (like how to dress) and are against Islamophobia look like idiots and jackasses. 

Literally nowhere in any of those links are Muslim women defending the stoning of women for not bleeding on their wedding nights. Not once. So nice fucking try but none of those links actually defend the inanity you've been spouting like shit from a cherry bombed port a potty."

A spectre is haunting Hollywood - the spectre of a sexual predator named Harvey Weinstein. All the powers of liberal elite have gathered their forces to exorcise this infamy. From New York Times and the New Yorker to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences down to every website and tabloid from coast to coast. What they could not do to Donald Trump now they are determined to do to Harvey Weinstein with a vengeance: Scandalise and run him out of town, as if he were an effigy of Donald Trump. 

In October 2017, The New York Times and The New Yorker came out with two bombshell exposes that dozens of women in the film industry had accused Harvey Weinstein, a prominent film producer, of sexual harassment, sexual assault and even rape.

Scores of other prominent actors - including Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and Mira Sorvino - subsequently came forward and accused Weinstein of such abusive behaviours. Weinstein, however, denied ""any non-consensual sex"", as his wife announced she was divorcing him. 

Weinstein was soon fired from the company he cofounded and expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. But still the key question persisted, how could such abuses go on for decades without being exposed. 

'Harvey Weinstein of Islam?'
In the middle of this traumatic event, in which the world outside Hollywood is coming to terms with the horrid fact of sexual abuse in the film industry, the appearance of a bizarre article in the New York Times with the title of ""Could this be the Harvey Weinstein of Islam?"" was jarring and outlandish, even for the New York Times.

The piece, penned by a notorious Ayaan Hirsi Ali wannabe, tells its readers: ""An activist in France leveled rape allegations against the grandson of the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood on Friday.""

We read the piece and we learn that a young Muslim woman in Paris, Henda Ayari, had written a book in French, J'ai choisi d'etre libre (I chose to be free), in which she had described how she was the subject of a sexual assault by a Muslim man, but had kept his identity anonymous. 

But with ""the #MeToo hashtag ricocheting around the globe, as women worldwide shared their experiences of sexual harassment and assault, Ayari found new courage"" and in a Facebook post declared: ""It is a very difficult decision but I too have decided it is time to denounce my attacker. It is Tariq Ramadan."" 

No amount of sexual violence by Muslim men, no matter how 'prominent' they may think they are, amounts to the astoundingly racist headline of 'the Harvey Weinstein of Islam' - as indeed Harvey Weinstein himself being a Jew has absolutely nothing to do with the noble, civilizing, and the enduring moral rectitude of Judaism.
 
The key question is not the actual content of this piece of news - for if indeed, as Ms Ayari alleges, a weak and vulnerable woman has been subjected to unwanted sexual advances and coerced into an abusive relationship against her will, then the matter must be exposed, denounced, and taken to any legal court if the victim so chooses, and the perpetrator ostracised and shamed. There is no discounting, dismissing, belittling, or sidestepping an allegation of such gravity. 

But the issue is not the substance of such allegations. Sexual violence is a global and transcultural malady and needs the global attention it now receives. Among the 1.6 billion Muslims around the world, no doubt Muslim men (like all other men) have their share of despicable sexual violence that needs to be exposed and addressed. But no amount of sexual violence by Muslim men, no matter how ""prominent"" they may think they are, amounts to the astoundingly racist headline of ""the Harvey Weinstein of Islam"" - as indeed Harvey Weinstein himself being a Jew has absolutely nothing to do with the noble, civilising, and the enduring moral rectitude of Judaism. 

How is that so? Allow me to explain. 

Islam as a metaphor of evil 

WATCH24:45
Harvey Weinstein, Hollywood and the US media
Did anyone call Harvey Weinstein ""the monster of Judaism?"" No - because his criminal monstrosity has nothing to do with Judaism. Did anyone call the other sexual predator Americans have freely and democratically elected as their president ""the Harvey Weinstein of Christianity""? No - because Donald Trump's shenanigans have nothing to do with Christianity. 

Muslim women are systematically raped and murdered in Myanmar - has anyone ever uttered the term ""Harvey Weinstein of Buddhism""? There are plenty of rapists in India - we have never read the New York Times calling them ""Harvey Weinstein of Hinduism"" - and rightly so. 

Why then should the New York Times fish around the world for one alleged case of sexual violence presumably perpetrated by a Muslim and call it ""Harvey Weinstein of Islam"".

Tariq Ramadan is indeed known mostly in Europe as a prominent Muslim, the grandson of another prominent Muslim - but no Muslim, no matter how prominent he might be, represents Islam. There are high-ranking Christian priests accused and even convicted of sexual abuse of children. There are Jewish rabbis calling for the wholesale massacre of Palestinians. There are power monger Shia clerics running a vicious theocracy in Iran. There are Sunni mass murderers roaming in Iraq and Syria. There are Buddhist monks slaughtering Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. But none of these atrocities can or should be declared as an indication of the categorical moral depravity of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism or Hinduism.

A Muslim, a Jew, a Christian, a Buddhist, a Hindu is a fallible human being. Islam, Judaism, Christianity, etc are abstract sacred orders, normative moral universes, definitive to the ethical intuition of our senses of the sublime and the truthful. The history of our humanity is ravaged by the moral depravity of all of us of whatever denomination we might be. But if against all odds we can still stand erect and tally any measure of truth to our existence it is precisely because the best and the sublimest in our self-transcendence have been summoned in these sacred orders.

Let's face it: We have an epidemic of sexual harassment

But today it is only Islam, and it is only in the United States, Europe, and Israel - the epicentre of white supremacist racism - that has been successfully and totally transformed into a singular signal of an unrelenting evil that needs to be eradicated. 

The New York Times today is integral to a massive Islamophobic machinery that marks Islam and Muslim as the diabolic enemy of history, of humanity, and of all manners and claims to a civilized life. If something like the Harvey Weinstein scandal has absolutely nothing to do with Muslims and Islam, they will find a pernicious way to find one case of alleged Muslim sexual violence and pin it down not on him as a person, a Muslim, a scholar, but on the entirety of ""Islam"" itself.

The target of this vicious Islamophobia is not just individual Muslims. It is against Islam itself. It aims to rob Muslims of the very fabric of their humanity, debone their moral rectitude to nullity - either to die under Bush, Obama, and Trump bombs from one end of the Muslim world to another or else convert to a ""Judeo-Christian"" creed and be saved and civilised.

365,dolq4c0,"I'm not saying you should hate Muslims, but what you should hate is Islam.

Muhammad was a pedophile, who married one of his wives at 6, the Qur'an says you should treat all Muslims like your brothers, but you should slay the non believers. Only Muslim women are forced to wear hijabs, burqas, niqabs because it's a symbol of ownership. Being gay is punishable by death in Islam, Sharia law doesn't let women drive, Muslim girls are often victims of FGM, they're obsessed with bombing people and Muslim migrants are raping, throwing acid and killing all over Europe. "
366,dmgxue1,"#Bullshit!

I've lived in Muslim communities in Indonesia and India and the uncomfortable truth is Muslim women are as feral and blood-thirsty as the men!

Muslim women are often the ones who honor kill their own children after grandpa had a ""sexual emergency"" and Muslim mothers are the ones who [dance for joy when their children die after suicide bombing innocent people at the local market... and refer to that day as their child's ""wedding day"".](http://palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=479)


    
"
367,dlvw2ds,"What? They're the ones being suicide bombed. They're the women, and the gays. And you're telling them they're not allowed in because of what they do to... themselves?

""Muslims are evil because they oppress Muslim women ergo Muslim women are also evil because they're Muslim? But then they're surpressing evil people now I guess? Muslims are good?"" If you don't seperate the oppressed from the oppressors, your point because a batshit insane of 'these people are evil for doing evil things to other evil people even though surely that shouldn't be evil'."
368,dk2bxeg,"The logic of female suicide bombers is simple: according to Islam, most women go to hell because they are inherently evil and cannot rise above that sufficiently to escape that fate. This is stated in the Koran. However there is a way to guarantee entry to paradise, no matter what evil deeds you have done before, and it is to die fighting jihad.

Anyone who dies fighting jihad not only goes to paradise himself, but also his/her entire extended family is guaranteed entry as well. So this women **knew for a fact** that not only was she going straight to paradise; so was the kid. As for the child being an orphan, Islam says that kids automatically go to paradise under such circumstances. This is a main reason that suicide bombers don't care if they take out ""innocent bystanders"" because they all go to paradise too so they have nothing to complain about. It's twisted, but they are prepared to die, and commit mass murder, to prove that they truly believe these doctrines to be correct.

Thus, Muslim women are led to believe that they have a poor chance of going to paradise, but there is this one way that's guaranteed to succeed."
369,djalqym,"sad really , kurds killing kurds ...unfortunately people have become so conditioned and indoctrinated ,to the point that , they have forgotten the rich cultural traditions and history of their ancestors....,, how do you even think the majority of the kurds, or for that matter , majority of the levantines , or for that matter , the majority of the people in the middle east are muslims????,, they always existed is it ??..they magically spouted off the ground , one fine day and became a majority overnight is it???......their ancestors were f***** yazidis , chrisitans , jews and zoroastrians before they became sunni muslims , and they didnt convert cause sunni islam was the one true religion or because God showed up and instructed them to or because the gulf arabs asked them nicely , and showered them with goodness and friendship and gifts .they converted because they were dominated by the gulf arabs politically and were ruled by them . and this muslim majority,didnt happen over night , the entire conversion process , took place over a period of centuries , due to the jizya tax ,to gain political favour, emotional blackmail by the oppressors , forced marriages (muslim men allowed to marry non muslims , while muslim women are not allowed ) and maybe due to a conscious decision by the non muslims to move up the social ladder or to become more accepted by the society created by the conquerors ,..

what the marauding sunni arab armies did in the middle east in the 7th century is not too dissimilar to what isis is doing now ,the same forced mass conversions to sunni islam , slavery of the indigenous non muslim women for sex and what not , slave markets , jizya tax ,homosexuals getting thrown off ledges, all exited , just that the 7th century gulf arabs were succesful(helped by the fact that , they didnt have the western powers barrel bombing them from the skies , ofcourse )
what you see now , has become a reality ,sunni muslims in the majority , and yazidis in the minority amongst the kurds ,due to the aforementioned realities that took place over the centuries. this is a microcosm of the entire middle east and north africa , give it another century or two , yazidis and druze in the muslim countries will become history , just like the followers of Manichaesim and Zoroaster and the very many forgotten middle eastern religions . once youre a sunni muslim , you wouldnt think twice of oppressing your own family,if they are not sunni muslims too . its all part of the indoctrination. the Kurds are pretty much oppressing their brethren , just because of the fact that they are not sunni muslims , its a subliminal thing really . almost visceral . sunni islam does that to you ."
370,dgzodbv,"It is sad how Muslim women are looked down upon for wearing hijabs. Almost like, ""oh poor, misled, oppressed dear..."" 

I'm a mostly white girl, but I'm also a language dork, so I know a few words in Arabic ( as well as about 40 other languages...a word or 2, usually ""hello"" or ""thank you""). I met a woman from Saudi Arabia in a store in my lunch break and we bonded over Arabic, and I gave her my card. Because of this, I started to get a bunch of Saudi women coming to see me at my salon. They probably also came because we had a private room in the salon too, but mostly all saw me, and followed me to other salons. Most of these women, under their hijabs, had the wildest, craziest hair! One woman explained it as, ""my hair is something special, for my husband, close family, and myself only. I do this because its fun, like sexy lingerie. Nobody knows I have hot pink hair under here, but I do, and it makes me feel confident. I show my sisters back home and it makes them so happy for me and a little jealous. I feel like a true Canadian or American woman like this."" To this i said, ""you ARE a true Canadian woman now."" 

Meeting these women and seeing them without hijabs really brought home to me that regardless of cultural or religious differences, we are all the same inside. This was circa 2004, So in the previous few years I had been bombarded with hysterical anti-islam rhetoric from the media. Of course I knew this was bullshit, but stuff like that can seep into your subconscious a little. I think that's why north American or Christian people are so weird about hijabs. I feel so sorry for this, and cringe so hard when I read a news story about some school or soccer team refusing to let a girl wear her hijab, or some such stupidity. 

Like anything you wear, eat, or do with your body, its a personal choice. I just wanted to share my slightly tangential hijab story with you. Whatever you choose, good luck."
371,fynxbps,"&gt;A bunch of cherry picked versus taken out of context in an attempt to paint a bad image.

Of course....""taken out of context""....#2 on the apologetics hit parade, right after ""problems with translation"".

&gt;Nowhere in the quran does it refer to Jews as ""sons of apes and swines"" so I have no idea what you are on about. If you think otherwise provide me the exact verse and then we can talk.

Surah 5.60

&gt; You honestly think that Muslims are allowed to marry Christian's and jews but are not allowed to befriend them ???

You certainly know that according to Islamic law, while Muslim men may indeed marry non-Muslim women, Muslim women are forbidden to marry non-Muslim men.

&gt;And about the question of not befriending Christians and jews. Loool Its Surah 5 verse 51 and you have butchered it.

Of course. Another taqqiya artist trying to convince gullible non-Muslims that the Quran really doesn't mean what it says. The actual verse is explicit and unambiguous.

&gt;I might not agree with their religious beliefs but in no shape or form does quran tell me to hate them.

The Quran is filled with exhortations to fight and kill the polytheists and the ""hypocrits"". You surely know this.

I'll close by saying that Muslims are individuals, like all human beings. Some are good, some are bad. I would gladly break bread with Zudi Jasser, Irshad Manja, and Qanta Ahmed. But ISLAM as a religion is like no other. It promulgates an explicitly supremacist, intolerant ethos. And that ethos has been manifest for the entire history of Islam, from Muhammad's mass murder of all the adult males of the Banu Qurayzah tribe,....to today's ISIS, and Al Qaeda, and the Taliban, and Boko Harem, and Abu Sayaf, and al Shabaab, and Hamas, and Hezbollah, and a myriad of other extremist groups, and the the gov't's of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Mauritania, Brunei, Pakistan, etc., all those that partially or completely adhere to Sharia. 

Your rank apologetics cannot change that reality so save your breath."

In 4% of the teachings of the Koran regarding Muslim women, women were superior, in 91% of the cases they were inferior and in 5% they were equal. But there is a big catch.

Muslims claim that Islam is a religion of peace and love but a statistical analysis of the teachings of the Koran display an Allah of hate, fear, terror, murder.

While there are over 300 references in the Koran to Allah and fear, there are only 49 references to love.  Of these love references, 39 are negative such as the 14 negative references to love of money, power, other gods and status. 

Three verses command humanity to love Allah and 2 verses are about how Allah loves a believer. There are 25 verses about how Allah does not love kafirs(unbelievers)
This leaves 5 verses about love. Of these 5, 3 are about loving kin or a Muslim brother. One verse commands a Muslim to give for the love of Allah. This leaves only one quasi-universal verse about love: give what you love to charity and even this is contaminated by dualism since Muslim charity only goes to other Muslims.   There are over 400 teachings of hate of all infidels: Jews, Christians, Idolaters Kafirs.
So much for love.  Hate and fear is what Allah demands. 

Islamic Hell is primarily political. Hell is mentioned 146 times in the Koran. Only 9 references are for moral failings—greed, lack of charity, love of worldly success. The other 137 references to Hell involve eternal torture for not agreeing that Mohammed is right. That is a political charge, not a morals failure. Thus 94% of the references to Hell are as a political prison for dissenters. The Golden Rule would empty Islam's political prison.

Of all of the references to ""hell"" in the trilogy, 6% are for moral failings, while 94% are for the transgression of disagreeing with Mohammed. Statistical analysis of the trilogy revealed that 97% of references to ""jihad"" relate to war and a mere 3% to the concept of ""inner struggle."" 
 
About 67% of the Koran of Mecca deals with punishing unbelievers for merely disagreeing with Mohammed.  Over 50% of the Koran of Medina deals with hypocrites and jihad against unbelievers.

375,fvcwjq8,"Muslim women are allowed to not wear their hijab/burqa in the same way Christian women are allowed to not wear crucifixes. It’s an outward manifestation of your religious beliefs that most women choose for themselves. Obviously one is more noticeable, but they follow the same vein.

And gays get murdered in this country, too, and we’re mostly Christian."
376,fvfs92r,"Apologies for the late reply, I was offline. Also, this post was too long and was split into 2 posts (the second one commented to this one) since it exceeded the character limit.

First I'd like to state that I'm in no way a scholar of the religion. Nor do I live in any country (inc. US) mentioned in your post. Nor am I familiar with all their laws. And I asked about Islam itself, not muslim countries, though I'll comment a bit on the countries before Islam.

What I will say is that being a country of muslims does not directly translate to being a country driven solely by Islam. The decisions of the ruler relate to doing what they view as best. This can be influenced by religion, since what they may view something as dirty due to their religion, or view something as good due to their religion. Other factors (such as the wealth of the country, the education of the country etc) also affect a rulers decisions. So whilst these countries are influenced by Islam, they are not driven **only** by Islam. As for the people in these countries, whilst they may be Muslim or not Muslim, that doesn't mean that their actions are representative of all Muslims or of Islam as a whole, once more, their actions are influenced by what they know of the religion, and what they know may be riddled with falsehoods or it may be limited. I believe these are third-world countries (correct me if I'm mistaken), so I doubt any of them can easily access information (like ebooks) via the internet.

As for what you mean by ""the right to vote"", Islam in of itself doesn't support a democratic society, so I don't know what you mean by this. You might think this isn't fair, but the reason behind it is that only those who are knowledgeable on a subject are able to directly influence decisions related to that subject. The people who aren't knowledgeable are still able to indirectly influence decisions. In a democratic society, an opinion with the most votes is taken. Just because an opinion has the most votes doesn't mean it represents the majority opinion of a country (not everyone votes), and even then, it doesn't mean it's correct. E.g. You have anti-vaxxers. Whilst they might not be the majority (idk if they are in any country), they are still a vocal minority. Compare vocal  to those that vote and non-vocal to those that don't vote. In this case, they would outlaw vaccines based off incorrect/debunked studies - they would directly **change** the country without having proper knowledge on the subject.

 As for whether I believe it's better to live in Saudi Arabia over a western world - yes, I do. I've been to Saudi Arabia before, and I could actually walk the streets at night (as a child) with my mum &amp; siblings, without fear. In contrast, I can't even do that during the day in the western country that I live in. Merely making eye contact with someone down the street from my house will result in them physically (i.e. visibly) being offended and they act accordingly.

As for Khadijah being a rich businesswoman - I've never heard of this before, could you cite the hadiths that state this so I can comment on it?

I've now read the articles you've sent. The first article was about Iran as a country - I disagree with a lot of what they're doing, from a religious perspective. It even said that one of their reasons for making it illegal to take precautions against child birth was due to wanting an increased population, not due to Islam. I consider my family to be more religious than the average westerner (e.g. when we can confirm that something goes against the religion, we stop doing it, rather than other people, who I know, that even despite being aware of something not being allowed, they do it anyway, to quote verbatim, ""I know it's not allowed, but I do it anyway"" from someone I spoke to earlier this year), and my mum went on birth control. I agree with the travelling out of the country and hijab laws, to a **degree**. I'll explain that after going over the other articles.

From the second article, it seems that the country can't change its laws because of protests. Equate this to the US. The vocal minority will protest anything and everything. Sometimes this is good, sometimes this is bad. You have the suffragette-equivalent protests on one end, and the anti-vax-equivalent protests on the other end. This is the fault of the people, not the religion. The public seem to even be assassinating the authorities by this article. It says that non-Muslim women are forced to marry Muslim men. In Islam, you're not meant to marry non-Muslims, let alone force people to marry you. There's also the fact that both men and women are able to divorce in islam. Hence, this goes against Islam, in my view. As are the murders to non-muslims. I'll copy and paste a previous post in regards to what Islam says on killing non-muslims - it is illegal except out of self-defence.

"" It isn't in Islam to force a non-Muslim to become Muslim - since sincerity is one of the conditions when it comes to accepting religion - so to be forced is to be insincere which is to be only muslim in name.

This is even affirmed in the Quran:

&gt;""There is no compulsion in religion""\[al-Baqarah 2:256\]

The Prophet (PBUH) also said that ""There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm"" - as such it isn't permissible to kill a non-muslim who isn't hostile, and instead, they should be treated with kindness so that they are to grow interested in the religion, and learn of it and then eventually result in converting, or resulting in them not being as discriminatory towards members of the religion like a lot of the people here.

This is further affirmed in the Quran:

&gt;""Allah does not forbid you from dealing justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity""\[al-Mumtahinah 60:8\]

And the attacking of non-muslims go against verses of the Quran:

&gt;""and do good as Allah has been good to you, and seek not mischief in the land. Verily allah does not like Mufsidoon \[those who commit great crimes &amp; sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischief-makers, corrupt etc\]""\[al-Qasas 28:77\]

And I remember someone once saying to me that 4:91 advocates the attacking of those of other religions. This can easily be countered by actually looking at the translation.

For reference, 4:91's translation:

&gt;You will find others who wish to obtain security from you and \[to\] obtain security from their people. Every time they are returned to \[the influence of\] disbelief, they fall back into it. So if they do not withdraw from you or offer you peace or restrain their hands, then seize them and kill them wherever you overtake them. And those - We have made for you against them a clear authorization.

It says ""if they do not withdraw from you or offer you peace or restrain their hands"". It is, quite literally, saying that if they are to raise arms against you or assault you, and do not stop their assault, then it is made permissible in the religion to kill them. i.e. self-defence is allowed, otherwise don't fight. 

And in Islam, you can't say that a person will go to hell. You can say that a group of people (e.g. saying ""non-muslims"") will go to hell, but when it comes to living individuals, they can change over the course of their life. A non-muslim can easily convert to muslim, and vice-versa. My uncle-in-law (husband of my aunt) is a muslim convert. Similarly, a family friend was a muslim who converted (idk what to or why, I've never met them, they were a friend of my dad and uncle). Therefore, I personally hold the belief that anyone can change. I personally went through a lot of change in my life as well, and I believe that I'm completely different both outwardly and inwardly than I was even 4 years ago. ""

Forcing sex, is of itself, not allowed in Islam. Having sex with someone you aren't married, in of itself, is not allowed in Islam. Both of these are happening according to the 2nd article, this goes against Islam. 

As for the third article, I personally disagree with even bothering with forcing someone into a marriage - it's a lot of effort when they can legally (i.e. by Islam) leave. You're not even supposed to force a marriage.

377,fvtudat,"Comparing being murdered by police to not being allowed to wear a piece of cloth on your head in a very select number of jobs? How about you go fuck yourself?

I mean, I get it. The government should not be telling people what to wear unless there is a good reason for it. But the headscarf has historically been something that muslim women were obliged to wear. So seeing it as a symbol of oppression is not a strange thing. Which makes all of this a difficult discussion. If a muslim women has to wear a scarf because their husband or father tells them to, that's fucked up. If a muslim woman wants to wear a scarf because they like the way it looks, that's fine. The problem is, in both cases the woman will say it's their own choice.

I often see young muslim women wearing a scarf, but also tight jeans, high heels, plenty of make up,.... In those cases the scarf is obviously just a fashionable accessory to their lifestyle, which is absolutely fine. The writer of this article is probably exactly that: a young, modern, liberated woman that happens to be muslim and is proud of that fact. But claming that this is the case for everyone wearing a headscarf is not a fair statement.

But religion is a personal choice, and that should in no way be exempted from laws or rules. Since all religions are made up, it would be too easy for people to ignore rules for that reason. So if the rules state no hats, that means no caps, no headscarfs, no silly jewish hats, no turban, no cowboy hat,.... But banning only religious hats is also fucking stupid. Because you know where those oppressed, forced-to-wear-headscarf muslim women are not? At university campusses...."
378,fqksex9,So you support the idea of keeping rapists and murderers alive? Maybe you are the violent nutcase. You don't have a clue how most Muslim women are treated. But they are definitely treated better than non Muslim women.
379,fqtub2q,"Yeah, I don’t think your examples are comparable. 

Arson and murder are violent crimes that infringe on another’s rights.

Breathing in public without a mask is not a crime bc it doesn’t infringe on your rights. You don’t have to leave your house if your afraid.   


Forcing me to wear a mask does infringe on my rights Just like how Muslim women are sometimes forced to wear a hijab...you want that level of tyranny in America? Are you a communist?!"
380,fqy3040,"I understand what youre saying, 
But in my experience, most of the women who wear the full blown Niqab do so out of pressure. They are abused..either physically or emotionally 

It comes down to the fact that IMO you shouldn't have to feel the need or responsibility to do this in the first place! Like their husbands dont.. Its pure oppression and control. 

Not saying all who do it are abused, but its fundamentalism.. Its not even Islam so at least, by banning it, it can help alleviate some of this abuse that women may experience.

Muslim women are still allowed to war hijab so I really don't see the problem? In the Koran it says obey the LAW OF the land! They should obey it.

I read one article from this paper about ""muslim women throwing boiled water and acid on hindu from the roof of their houses"" during Delhi riot, the article failed to mention, what the Hindu were doing around their houses. Just an attempt to show how muslim women are so vindictive. 

And when I pointed out that these women do so to save themselves from getting raped and murder during riots from rioters and what were hindu doing around their houses. I was downvoted to oblivion."
382,fq72a5m,"First off, Pew are the ones that acknowledged barely 3 years ago that ""Muslim women are having an average of 2.9 children compared to the 1.8 had by non-Muslims"" in the UK.  And that non-Muslim number is inflated by non-Brits; we're among the lowest in the world, anything from 1.3-1.5 when discounting immigrants, Muslims and the like.  Lithuanians, Poles, they have high birth rates here, and once it all goes to shit, they'll flock back home with their kids (they fled their own countries when times got tough, after all).  

Secondly, you're diluting the argument by bringing the rest of Europe into it; I never mentioned them, I said that Muslims might be a majority by 2061, of the UK, not Europe.  Although of WESTERN EUROPE, they'll be a lot more than 16% (you're diluting the argument by bringing Eastern Europe into the equation, where Poland, Ukraine, Hungary etc. don't really have Muslims, thus downplaying the reality of the west).

Thirdly, by my 70% growth rate, by 2050, we'd be looking at 20 million Muslims, just so we can compare.  Also, that article is make believe; 70% growth for 40 years consistently is a very reliable trajectory, it's all we have to go off of; anything else is guesswork.  Assuming that it's going to randomly drop off a few decades from now is baseless.  And even if we were to take these laughably low numbers of 13 million (like there's going to be zero migration, with the left wing idiots we've had in charge from both parties since 1997 maintaining open borders), that's a gigantic, terrifying number, with their religion and viewpoints.  More than tripling within 30 years while we're dying out.  What an insidious nightmare we face.  Their younger generations are more radical than the old (proof in the next paragraph), their views on homosexuality, free speech, women, apostasy, just worshipping a mass murdering paedophile and considering him the perfect human being, one to name their kids after FULL STOP is horrific.

According to a poll done by Policy Exchange, with a survey of over 1000, forty per cent of Muslims between the ages of 16 and 24 said they would prefer to live under sharia law in Britain, a legal system based on the teachings of the Koran. The figure among over-55s, in contrast, was only 17 per cent. Forty per cent of younger Muslims said they would want their children to attend an Islamic school, compared to only 20 per cent of over-55s.

This is from a Channel 4 poll, the percentage of Muslims who want homosexuality to be illegal:

50% of Muslims 55+

54% of Muslims 45-54.

55% of Muslims 35-44.

65% of Muslims 25-34.

71% of Muslims 16-24.

37% of 16 to 24-year-olds said they would prefer sharia law rather than British law, against 17% of those over 55.

A third (36% to be exact) of 16 to 24-year-olds believed that those converting to another religion should be executed, while less than a fifth of those over 55 believed the same.

Here's some more of what some are stupid enough to admit to:

One additional point about the symmetry between honor killing and the stoning of adulteresses....whenever a Muslim apologist dismisses moral indignation over the stoning punishment in Islamic law by claiming that it is exceedingly rare, our response should be: 

""Muslim women are rarely stoned to death because stoning is a public spectacle and the men-folk of the family in question typically ""cleanse"" the family honor by dispatching the woman before the case ever gets to trial."""
388,fb68dk3,"MUHAMMAD VERSUS ALLAH: STATASTICAL ANALYSIS

 Research on the Koran, conducted by the Center for Political Islam, illustrates the Islamic focus on conformist behavior and beliefs. According to the Center's analysis of the Koran, the Sira, and the Hadith, only 17% of the Islamic trilogy deals with the words of Allah. The remaining 83% refers to the words and deeds of Mohammed. Of all of the references to ""hell"" in the trilogy, 6% are for moral failings, while 94% are for the transgression of disagreeing with Mohammed. 

Statistical analysis of the trilogy revealed that 97% of references to ""jihad"" relate to war and a mere 3% to the concept of ""inner struggle.""About 67% of the Koran of Mecca deals with punishing unbelievers for merely disagreeing with Mohammed. Over 50% of the Koran of Medina deals with hypocrites and jihad against unbelievers. Nearly 75% of the Sira deals with jihad. About 20% of the Hadith by Bukhari is about jihad. The majority of the doctrine is political and it is all violent.

WOMEN IN ISLAM: STATASTICAL ANALYSIS

In 4% of the teachings of the Koran regarding Muslim women, women were superior, in 91% of the cases they were inferior and in 5% they were equal. But there is a big catch. The only way that Muslim women are equal is after death on Judgment day, when men and women will be judged on how well they followed the Koran and the Sunna. And guess what? The only way to follow the Koran and the Sunna is to obey men. Equality means obeying men. 

Muslim women are superior by being a mother, who must obey her husband. So the perfect woman on Judgment day will be a mother, who obeyed all the men in her life. So really, the Muslim women are subordinate to men in 100% of all of the Koran, Hadith and the Sira.
Infidel women can be raped, murdered, and enslaved.  These are all holy acts ordained by Allah.  Hell on earth is their fate at the hands of Muslim men.
Mm"

But, thousands of meters away hundreds of men interpret the same verse as ""every woman who doesn't wear hijab is a non-believer, therefore she's an ally of satan, therefore our god want us to kill her"".

392,f4susri,"&gt;The bible literally recommends the punishment of death for committing the sin of homosexual sex. As far as the bible is concerned, the reward for not having gay sex is being allowed to continue living. That doesn't sound like that great of a reward.

You should take that up with a Christian. See my flair. I'm telling you what I believe. The reward I'm speaking of is eternal bliss in Paradise.

&gt;Not to mention the endless onslaught of verbal abuse that Christians continuously barrage homosexuals and other ""sinners"" with.

I want to address this part first. Absolutely people should never be abused like that for any reason. Especially if they don't believe in the same moral framework. Who am I to judge someone with my moral criteria if they don't even believe it's correct? It's totally unfair. So, I'd never walk up to a Christian and say you're going to hell for idolatry like I'd never do the same to a person who has sex with the same gender. Idolatry is way worse btw... If someone is interested in my perspective I'll have a respectful conversation with them, be they Christian, homosexual, communist, anarchist, or even a Nazi as long as they aren't trying to hurt me or anyone else... There's no benefit to anyone in abusing people. It only alienates them and drives them further away from your perspective.

&gt;If Christians didn't actually punish people for their sins in this life, as the bible instructs them to do, I wouldn't really have a problem with it. The issue is that Christians don't leave it up to God to judge, and instead follow the instructions of the bible and have literally stoned people to death for committing sins.

&gt;Not to mention that a lot of people don't even believe being homosexual is wrong, so its still not acceptable for God to judge them for having a relationship with a person of the same sex.

These go hand in hand in my view. Say, you've got a legal system that is based on any worldview. It can't be considered fair to punish people for not following the main worldview if they don't even believe in it. Obviously barring crimes against other people like rape or murder or theft etc. But communities with similar worldviews should be able to follow their own worldview and not be compelled to do otherwise. I believe this whether the official worldview of this hypothetical government is Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Liberalism, communism, Judaism, or anything else. A modern example might be a case in Pakistan where a Christian lady said she didn't believe Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was a true prophet and she was punished for that. But that's obvious. She's a Christian, so she obviously doesn't believe in his prophethood ﷺ. How can she possibly be punished for that? Or another example in France where Muslim women are forced to wear less clothing. Niqab is illegal in public and hijab is illegal on government property if memory serves. How can these women be punished for following their worldview?

&gt;a lot of people don't even believe being homosexual is wrong, so its still not acceptable for God to judge them for having a relationship with a person of the same sex.

But as to how God Himself will judge people with different worldviews, I'm not sure. But I know that every single aspect of everyone's life will be taken into account and given consideration and God will use every excuse to forgive people. Be it their experiences, mental health, physical health, influences, childhood, environment, etc. That I am sure of. I often use an example of a sentinelese person with no connection to the rest of the world. A person who never had the opportunity to accept Islam. They will surely be given far more leeway than myself who has already accepted Islam."

I'm not talking about 150 years ago, in taking about right now. Not to be disrespectful, but this sound like such 'whitesplaining'. Muslim women are treated FAR worse than Christian women as a group.

The move to paint Islam as a pioneering force in women's rights is a recent one, corresponding with the efforts of Muslim apologists (not otherwise known for their feminist leanings) and some Western academics prone to interpreting history according to personal preference. In truth, the Islamic religious community has never exhibited an interest in expanding opportunities for women beyond the family role.

The fourth Caliph, who was Muhammad's son-in-law and cousin, said just a few years after the prophet's death that ""The entire woman is an evil. And what is worse is that it is a necessary evil."" 

A traditional Islamic saying is that, ""A woman's heaven is beneath her husband's feet."" One of the world's most respected Quran commentaries explains that, ""Women are like cows, horses, and camels, for all are ridden."" (Tafsir al-Qurtubi v. 17, p. 172)

The revered Islamic scholar, al-Ghazali, who has been called 'the greatest Muslim after Muhammad,' writes that the role of a Muslim woman is to ""stay at home and get on with her sewing. She should not go out often, she must not be well-informed, nor must she be communicative with her neighbors and only visit them when absolutely necessary; she should take care of her husband... and seek to satisfy him in everything... Her sole worry should be her virtue... She should be clean and ready to satisfy her husband's sexual needs at any moment."" [Ibn Warraq, Why I Am Not a Muslim p.47 quoting Ghazali's ""The Revival of Religious Sciences""]

A Yemeni cleric recently explained in a television broadcast what makes women inferior and unable, say, to serve as good witnesses: ""Women are subject to menstruation, when their endurance and mental capacity for concentration are diminished. When a woman witnesses a killing or an accident, she becomes frightened, moves away, and sometimes even faints, and she cannot even watch the incident.""

During a 2012 talk show on an Egyptian television channel, a cleric slammed Christianity - in part for teaching gender equality: “the Christian religion does not differentiate between women and men, but it confirms their perfect equality: it gives them an equal share in inheritance, it bans divorce, and it bans polygamy.”

In 2014, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan emphasized that men and women are not equal: ""Our religion has defined a position for women (in society): motherhood.""

Linda Sarsour, a hijab-clad Sharia proponent who also bills herself as a 'feminist' said of a real feminist, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, that she should have her vagina removed for opposing Islam.  The remarks were particularly hateful given that Hirsi Ali is a survivor of female genital mutilation.

Umm Jamaal ud-Din, a female preacher in Australia, cited Muhammad's own words from the Hadith regarding ""insufficiency of intelligence"" in questioning a woman's fitness for holding important positions: ""Due to a woman being more sensitive and delicate in her nature, her ability to accurately recall information may be affected in situations where she's required to bear witness for cases involving conflicting parties, since such situations usually involve fairly high levels of stress and pressure.""

The many opportunities denied women under Islamic law, from equal testimony in court to the simple right to exclude other wives from their marital bed, is very clear proof that women are of lesser value then men in Islam. Muslim women are not even free to marry outside the faith - and some pay with their lives for doing so.

Islamic law also specifies that when a woman is murdered by a man, her family is owed only half as much ""blood money"" (diya) as they would be if she had been a man. (The life of a non-Muslim is generally assessed at one-third).

Although a man retains custody of his children in the event of his wife's death, a non-Muslim woman will automatically lose custody of her children in the event of her husband's death unless she converts to Islam or marries a male relative within his family. 

Contemporary Muslims like to counter that Arabs treated women as camels prior to Muhammad. This is somewhat questionable, given that Muhammad's first wife was a wealthy woman who owned property and ran a successful business prior to ever meeting him.  She was even his boss... (although that may have changed after the marriage).  Still, it is somewhat telling that Islam's treatment of women can only be defended by contrasting it to an extremely primitive environment in which women were said to be non-entities.

Homa Darabi was a talented physician who took her own life by setting herself on fire in a public protest against the oppression of women in Islamic Iran. She did this after a 16-year-old girl was shot to death for wearing lipstick. In the book, Why We Left Islam, her sister includes a direct quote from one of the country's leading clerics:

""The specific task of women in this society is to marry and bear children. They will be discouraged from entering legislative, judicial, or whatever careers which may require decision-making, as women lack the intellectual ability and discerning judgment required for these careers.""

Modern day cleric Abu Ishaq al-Huwaini has called for a return of the slave markets, where Muslim men can order concubines. In this man's ideal world, ""when I want a sex-slave, I go to the market and pick whichever female I desire and buy her.""

At best, Islam ""elevates"" the status of a woman to somewhere between that of a camel and a man.  Muhammad captured women in war and treated them as a tradable commodity. The ""immutable, ever-relevant"" Quran explicitly permits women to be kept as sex slaves. These are hardly things in which Muslims can take pride."
406,eo68ur9,Isn't that exactly what raggers like her believe in. I mean after all real muslim women are essentially chattel for their husbands and are not allowed to have abortions or even leave the house without permission. Yet they have the death penalty for just about anything that disagrees with their murderous pedophile of a prophet.
407,eoetkfa," [r/exmuslim](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim) is filled with Hindutva (Hindu extremist) trolls from India. They are known for this type of thing. [r/indianpeoplefacebook](https://www.reddit.com/r/indianpeoplefacebook) pretty much makes fun of the fact that so many of them do this. In India there is sadly a huge shortage of women due to abortion and the murder of females, and a huge surplus of guys. This is why rape, sexual harassment and sexual violence are so common in India - more than anywhere else in the world. This is why so many ex-Muslim women are getting harassed so much on that forum - dudes in India are massively thirsty. You don't see this stuff from Pakistanis or Bangladeshis or Sri Lankans, because they don't murder females en mass like they do in India. Furthermore the people blaming this as some sort of vestige of ""Muslim culture"" are Hindutva trolls themselves. They'll literally do anything to blame Islam."
408,eogtivh," Surah Al-Nur (the Light) (24:31) in the Quran states: **""They (the believing women) should draw their head coverings over their bosoms...""**. . Surah Al-Ahzab (33:59) states: **""O Prophet [PBUH] Tell thy wives and daughters and the believing women that they should put on their outer garments; that is most convenient in order that THEY MAY BE RECOGNIZED (as Muslims) and not be molested.""**

Its simple logic, the more muslim population grows they will vote in muslim politicians making this mandatory. According to Mo, non muslim women are open to molestation. 

People saying christian shariah is a thing. Abortion is murder, you cant murder anyone else, you cant murder a baby. Not any kind of combination of church and state"
409,eq8tytg,"I may not have been clear enough in my writeup but I do think she agrees with you, and so do I.

&gt;  In the news in these countries there were a few very well publicised cases of Muslim men murdering their young wives and Muslim families murdering their daughters for wanting to be free from their abusive older partners or to be free from arranged marriage.

Arranged marriage, or as I more charitably described it, a culture in which the family have greater input into the choice of partner for their children, is not inferior to Western marriage practices. The mainstream media regularly portray it as inferior. As good feminists Razack agrees with you that we should push back against this racist characterisation.

However, when a young woman has to risk murder to avoid marriage to a man of her family's choice or risk murder to divorce her husband, that is a human rights issue. Patriarchal violence is a human rights issue. Wherever there is patriarchal violence Razack believes we have a duty to try to remove it. However, Muslim women are minorities in Western countries and are subject to this patriarchal violence. How can the overwhelmingly white, non-muslim legal and political systems help Muslim women defend themselves against patriarchy without being racist and imperialist, without assuming the superiority of individualism, without assuming our women are already perfectly free? That is the problem she is grappling with."
410,em4rcdd,"“Makes History.”

Lol yeah reverting back to garments that are designed to repress sexual expression is very “making history.”  This is just to appease Muslim women and white liberals who want both worlds. A world where oppressed Muslim women are normalized into liberal society without offending the religion because they view them as a brown culture. 


What would have been more “making history” is if a woman who lived under subjugation set aside the restricting body coverings and confidently showed her body in a modern swimsuit. But we all know that the Muslim women that claim to represent Islam are all complacent with Islamic agenda to subjugate women, murder gays and convert their biggest enemy, America."
411,em5br7v,"What protect the tribe mentality? I hate to say it but within the Ummah I've seen far too many brothers and sisters who are willing to sell out fellow Muslims or even outright calling takfir over the smallest issues. If we had ANY sense of unity whatsoever, your Caliphate never would have fallen. The Banu Saud wouldn't have demolished Jannat al-Baqi. We wouldn't be third world countries right now. Palestine would actually be a country. If we had any sense of unity, black water mercenaries who murdered civilians in Iraq wouldn't be getting billions from corrupt sheikhs in the UAE and Qatar. LOL.

I don't see Muslim women rushing to defend us. As a Muslim man, I've seen far more of my own sisters who treat me (and other Muslim men) like crap, but will fawn over any white non-Muslim. And yeah, it does often play into a lot of the anti-Muslim bigotry because the Islamophobia industry has a really weird fixation on the sexual lives of Muslim women, almost to the point of fetishization. Muslim men are portrayed as monsters who need to be killed or converted into good little subservient third world menial laborers like non-Muslims in Africa, Asia and Latin America, while Muslim women are portrayed as beautiful oppressed victims who need to be rescued by white Western men. Its why bigots like Ayaan Hirsi Ali are so popular with them, and why they hate Linda Sarsour and Ilhan Omar so much."
412,em6yexk,"the point is that the group of western liberal muslims you are referring to is a tiny minority of muslims.

There are more muslims in almost every country on that list than in the US.  the US is not representative of the muslim world.

I have no problem with people wearing what they want.  I have no problem with liberal muslims to moving and living in the US.

I fully support their right to practice what they want. 

But the fact is they are a minority.  Most muslims are extremely conservative, and most muslim women are very oppressed.  This is the broader context these discussions about burqas take place in.  You have to acknowledge that MANY women leave under fear of DEATH if they do not abide by restrictive laws controlling their behavior, appearance, and sexuality.  Women are murdered all the time for violating these ""cultural norms.""

That is why I will not cheer when women choose to flaunt this culture as a fashion, any more than I'd cheer for a white hood.  It represents oppression for millions of people."
413,em858c4,"&gt;Saudi is a dictatorship that was placed by the british.

Historical fact: saudis are arabs who were helped by the british, not placed by them. Saudis were born and raised in what we now call Saudi Arabia. They are Muslims and are very proud to be the custodian of Mecca. They fund islamic education throughout the world via madrassahs and have made Islamic law the highest law in the land. Saudis have created an islamic council that oversees public morals according to islam, along with a secret police designed to implement Islamic laws.

So, yeah, blame the british for all that, including the fact that a woman counts as half a witness as opposed to men. 

Blame the british for saudis chopping off hands.

Blame the british for saudis beheading people according to islamic law.

Blame the british for saudis carrying out public whipping and stoning according to islamic law.

Blame the british for saudis requiring 4 witnesses before a woman's accusations of rape are believed.

Come on, guy. You KNOW you're wrong and are trying very hard to make painfully awkward arguments. You may even be used to regurgitating this drivel so it probably doesn't even feel strained and stupid to you anymore, but anyone with half a brain is no longer buying that ""sAuDiS aReN'T tRuE mUsLimS"" bullshit anymore.

&gt;Woman have more rights in Islam than any other thing on this world today. Women are our queens and future.

Is that why all these Muslim women are seeking asylum in western countries from Muslim men? Or sorry, i mean ""british placed dictators"".

lol

&gt;Omar bin abdulazeez one of the greatest leaders had a person hired to follow him with one job: if that person sees the Caliph making a corrupt decision that person would shake him and say fear Allah oh Omar for you will die. 

Yeah that sounds like a total lie, doesn't it? because the rightly guided caliphs themselves tried to murder each other so they could be in charge instead of the other one... and not even muhammad himself was ""shaken"" by anyone - they would've been murdered on the spot.

That's the fact: NO muslim leader has ever been held accountable - not even muhammad nor anyone after him. This myth that the ideal ruler is one who is willing to be bitch slapped by random people on the street HAS NEVER existed and will never exist. 

But you can masturbate to that thought all day, meanwhile women are still not allowed to vote, to go out ALONE, their cries about being raped are ignored and they are instead punished if they complain to the authorities. That's the reality of the Muslim world... meanwhile you're sitting happily content dreaming about a world that has never nor will ever exist.

you're part of the problem with your ignorant delusions about muslims and islam. It's not perfect - it's not even humane in many cases and you have the duty as a human being to stand up for women's rights and for freedom."
414,ej2jvjk,"""Especially"" does not mean ""preferentially"" mah dude. I am a woman, and I asked you a question as a challenge to why you think you have a right to silence discussion regarding femicide and gendered violence in religions and how that relates to the means to and the rights to self defense. 

So, I'll say it again ,I fully support Muslim women especially in arming themselves, because they hardly do and are frequently oppressed, abused and murdered by Muslim men because the religion is segregationist and opressive of women. Most people seeking guns are men, and men commit 90% of murders and rapes, especially of women. 

Muslim women are an oppressed class on two fronts. They are Muslim , and they are women. 

Your entire argument that we aren't allowed to talk about these things is part of the narrative of oppression of (women and LGBT.) "
415,ej2lkri,"&gt;With the exception of some countries ahem Iran ahem, women are not more oppressed than Muslim men. 

Have you ever heard of the expression ""separate but equal?"" and why that is banned in the US? 

The only loophole to that kind of bigotry is religion, where, (correct me if I am wrong) women in Islam (just like many Christian groups btw) are barred from leadership, (can't be imams) and forced to sit segregated (separate) in churches.

Now, that's just one example of actual oppression that is (sadly) still legal even in the US, but shall I go on and talk about how Muslim women are treated in other misogynistic ways and backed by the Muslim faith? What are the domestic violence, rape and murder rates? How are non-virgin, non-married, ""slutty"" Muslim women and girls treated?

So, no. Sorry, not buying it. As a woman who is intimately familiar with patriarchal, misogynist, rape culture religious bullshit, I'm calling you on this. "
416,ej597h9,"I think we should consider the context of the photograph before we make such objections. Muslim women oft wear it by choice (in the context of Western societies) and consider it a tool of empowerment. If one reads texts by 'Islamic' feminists, they argue that it is a defense against the male gaze and assault against the normalization of women as sexual objects (of course, in consideration to feminists who do wear it. Other Islamic feminists such as I will argue it has no place in Islam). 

Muslim women are most vulnerable in the West for they are oft berated in public for their headscarf or labelled as being 'oppressed' (it is quite paradoxical to oppress a woman for supposedly being 'oppressed' but okay). The women who were murdered in the context of this event wore it by choice and felt empowered by it. Such an objection in the context of this event is distasteful for it seeks to remove the acknowledgement of these women being Muslims for after all, it was them being Muslim which lead into their deaths. It is quite obvious Hijab bearing women are otherized and treated foreign. Bearing the Hijab in the context of this event seeks to normalize Hijabi women as those who are accepted within the West rather than rejected and disrespected. We can make these objections later but it is disrespectful to do it right now."
417,ejuzd1t,"How many incidents were there where muslim women are specifically attacked for their religion in India? I can count on my fingers while in pakistan there is a systemic oppression of minorities. The difference is when muslims are attacked in India, they get swift justice and the attackers get punished. On the other hand, Hindus have no rights in pakistan. pakistan is an islamic theocracy. Hindus can't freely practice their religion, own business, become leaders in pakistan. The population of Hindus in pakistan after independence from British decreased whilst population of muslims in India in the same period doubled. When Asia Bibi and other minority groups faced blasphemy charges in pakistan and they were publicly murdered. The situation was so bad, Asia Bibi's lawyer had to leave the country. Hindu population in pakistan is literally facing a genocide."
418,ek68fm9,"Based on that anecdotal evidence all Muslim women are compelled to wear hijab? 

A non-Muslim guy in my town killed a woman because she was divorcing him, does that therefore mean all women stay with their husbands for fear of being murdered ? No. It doesn’t because that’s a ridiculous logic. Some inevitably will be in a situation where they are scared to leave an abusive partner, others actually have happy marriages. We don’t respond to it by vilifying the institution of marriage as a whole. 

Same logic: some Muslim women feel compelled to wear. Some don’t.  The solution for that isn’t to vilify a scarf and all those who wear it, it’s to make sure women worldwide are afforded agency to do as they please.  Whether that be to put it on or take it off safely. "
419,ekba31z,"Homosexuality is not a sin, acting on it is. It says so in the Hadith here;

&amp;#x200B;

There is definitely racism in Islam. Prophet Muhammad was a white man who owned black slaves, he likened Ethiopians (black people) to ""raisin-heads"" (Sahih al-Bukhari 7142) and said that a black slave is worth half that of a white one (Sahih al-Bukhari 4625). He also said that the worst possible leader is one of a slave whose head is black and looks like a raisin. When one of Muhammad's black slaves were killed, he said that man wouldn't go to heaven as he had taken a cloak before the spoils of war were divided. According to Muhammad, satan looks like a black guy (Ibn Ishaq P.243).

&amp;#x200B;

Oppression of women? How about saying that women's testimonies are worth half that of a man? How about saying that women are mentally deficient and have half the intelligence of a man? A sister inherits half that of her brother. 

Consensual sex is not a thing in a marriage in Islam, men can have sex with their wives whenever they feel like it. Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other... As for those from whom you fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and scourge them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them. 

According to Muhammad, a nation led by a woman will fail. Muslim men are allowed to marry 4 women, and women of any faith. Muslim women are only allowed to marry Muslims, and only one. Muslim women have to wear a veil, men do not. Islam supports female genital mutilation. Is that not oppressive enough for you?

&amp;#x200B;

Paedophilia is allowed, numerous Hadiths from different Hadith collections tell us about Aisha's age when Muhammad married her and when Muhammad consummated the marriage. She was 6 or 7 and 9 years old respectively;

 

**Sahih al-Bukhari 5158**—The Prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death).

**Sahih Muslim 3480**—It was narrated that Aishah said: “The Prophet married me when I was six years old, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine years old.”

**Sahih Muslim 3481**—It was narrated from Aishah that the Prophet married her when she was seven years old and she was taken to him as a bride when she was nine years old, and she took her dolls with her. He died when she was eighteen years old.

**Sunan an-Nasa'i 3378**—It was narrated that 'Aishah said: ""The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls.""

**Sunan an-Nasa'i 3379**—It was narrated that 'Aishah said: ""The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine.""

**Sunan Abu Dawud 2121**—The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) married me when I was seven years old. The narrator Sulaiman said: or Six years. He had intercourse with me when I was nine years old.

Murder of Jews and Christians is okay if they refuse to pay the Jizyah;

Then invite them to migrate from their lands to the land of Muhairs and inform them that, if they do so, they shall have all the privileges and obligations of the Muhajirs. If they refuse to migrate, tell them that they will have the status of Bedouin Muilims and will be subjected to the Commands of Allah like other Muslims, but they will not get any share from the spoils of war or Fai' except when they actually fight with the Muslims (against the disbelievers).

The rest of the world does not have these crimes occurring at this level and you know it. It's far worse in the Middle East than any other region.


It's not about accepting homosexuality. Muslims want to BAN homosexuality. They want homosexuals in jail. And find me comparable polls. According to Pew, 54 percent of Christians want homosexuals to be accepted. None of them wanted to BAN homosexuals and put them in jail like over half of Muslims do.

In Islam it is not forbidden to rape infidels, and much prefered to rape a virgin

It is also in Islamic law: “When a child or a woman is taken captive, they become slaves by the fact of capture, and the woman’s previous marriage is immediately annulled.” (*Umdat al-Salik* O9.13)

&amp;#x200B;

When a slave market is erected, which is a market in which are sold slaves and sex-slaves, which are called in the Qur’an by the name *milk al-yamin*, “that which your right hands possess” \[Koran 4:24\]. This is a verse from the Qur’an which is still in force, and has not been abrogated. The *milk al-yamin* are the sex-slaves. You go to the market, look at the sex-slave, and buy her.

&amp;#x200B;

Non-Muslim women are doubly damned: not only are they, as infidels, “the enemy” by default but as females, they are deemed even more inferior than their already despised male counterparts.  Add to this the facts that women are physically weaker—and physically more attractive—than men, and it becomes clear why they are widely seen as being, at best, “meant for one thing, the pleasure of the Muslim man,” as one Muslim [told](http://www.raymondibrahim.com/2016/01/25/pakistan-christian-girls-are-only-meant-for-the-pleasure-of-muslim-men/) a group of young Christian girls before terrorizing and murdering one.  (Koran verses that encourage the [sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women](https://quran.com/4/24-34) and ingrained notions of “[sex-on-demand,](https://sunnah.com/urn/1261700)” obviously only propel such thinking.)"
427,e8piucm,"&gt; Feminists in first world countries fight on behalf of other countries.

If you’re only fighting for the horrible, *actually legitimate* problems faced by women in other countries, and stop pretending like there’s issues that legitimize it’s existence in first world countries, then we’ll be perfectly fine. Usually I don’t hear a fucking peep out of any leftist when women in Iran start fighting for their rights, when Islamic women are constantly trampled over, etc. Covering up their heads and faces is somehow seen as... being empowered? Hmm weird. 

&gt;Strawman

Yeah I’m not sure if you just don’t know much about the me too movement? I was talking specifically about it the issues it aims to address, so I’m not sure how that’s a strawman. If you use it as evidence, then fucking excuse me for believing you adhere to its mission statement. 

&gt; Another strawman but again, it's okay, just show me the numbers of cases 

I’m so glad you took it here. There probably will never be a way to tell because there are a shocking lack of laws that protect men from sexual assault and rape, and confine the definitions of each to very narrow terms (e.g., there has to be “penetration” of the male). In other words, women have *far* more protections than men when it comes to sexual assault. 


&gt; a slap on the wrist

Yeah, as I said, this is only your opinion due to how high-profile the case was. Go ahead and look up the typical sentences for people with clean backgrounds. They typically get a minimum. And even if he was sentenced to 6 years, he would’ve had all but like 1 year or so suspended. You can be vengeful and violent all you want. Like it or not, that’s how the prison system works. If your problem is with that, then we can talk about the justice system. But that is far from a feminist issue. Either way, despite this case’s extremely high profile, it’s still just one case. Even if this would have been as abhorrent as people behave like it is, it’s still one case, and doesn’t really justify a feminist movement. That would be like anti-immigration people saying Mollie Tibbetts’ murder alone justifies a passionate campaign against all illegals and mass deportation immediately. 

&gt; The thousands of women and young girls raped and assaulted across america in college frats 

I’m guessing you’re referring to campus sexual assault, and you probably shouldn’t just reduce this to fraternities. Although I agree, fraternities often times promote toxic masculinity, which in turn can lead to sexual entitlement. Toxic masculinity is an entire issue. And, once again, I wouldn’t call that even close to a feminist issue. That’s a men’s issue. 

To continue on with campus sexual assault, you can refer back to my comments about me too. Protections and laws are there for women, not for men. Campus sexual assault is a campus issue, not refined to women or men specifically. The only difference is that men can’t prosecute it in a court of law, while women can. 

&gt; Out of sight out of mind

Not out of sight, and not out of mind. Once again, if feminism’s focus was the shit that women go through in countries that would actually benefit from feminism, then I have no issues. But it’s irrelevant in 1st world countries. Women are not only equal, but have it better. "

We’re bigger people then u so we’ll let u do that.” If anything, the fact that this guy callously normalised the murdering of apostates for no reason other than their apostasy is indicative of his warped POV and perspective.

Secondly not anyone can kill them. I seem to recall a tale about Mashal Khan who was lynched by people for leaving Islam in Pakistan. It wasn’t state sanctioned but I have yet to hear ① person from Pakistan claim his death was undeserved and there’ve even been mass riots to get his murderers freed. Before u claim only certain people are allowed to kill apostates at least do something to address the fact that all Muslims feel they have the right to and many do so with brazen disregard for the law, order or civilisation because a tribal attachment to their own Islamic roots is more important to them.

Secondly, I have yet to see a single case in which any questions given to any Islamic authority has lead to any valid answers. Take for example Zakir Naik, many people have given him questions which clearly stand counter to strict Islamic interpretations, with heavy evidence backing their assertions. My favourite of these was ① person arguing for evolution. Zakir Naik instead of addressing these claims sought to belittle the educational standing of the asker, claim the scientific consensus and backing behind it is flawed despite it being considered a universal fact by almost the entire scientific community and after growing irritated at his inability to prove his point, lashed out at the asker and stormed off stage. This isn’t an isolated incident. The proposition that Islam has an answer for everything is flawed because it doesn’t; if it did then why is war, famine, poverty, injustice still a thing &amp; why are these things prevalent, moreso then anywhere else, in Islamic countries. Therefore putting people to death, regardless of after how many chances u give them to revert, is a flawed approach to silence people who can raise valid questions against Islam which Islam is unable to answer and is thus just a cowardly cover up operation. Besides all this, killing someone for thinking different to u or choosing to leave a faith which for the vast majority of people was chosen for them, is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.

The following points on apostasy being tantamount to treason is also insane. For one, death isn’t the automatic and immediate response for treason, more often than not motivations are extracted and attempts to fix whatever distrust in the country lead to the rebellion is performed. Even if that wasn’t enough, a person choosing not to accept a belief system isn’t equal to picking up a gun and shooting a king. I can’t believe I have to explain this, but lo and behold. Also, leaving Islam motivates others to leave Islam cause it proves they won’t be killed, your approach to kill any who leave is fear monger if and tyranny and if nothing else, people are justified if they rebel against that. 

Muslims who get angry insult Allah. Well, how the f*ck is that your problem. Allahs a big boy, he can fix his own problems. And even if he couldn’t, a person insulting allah in no way affects you in any way. For example FUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKKKK!!!! ALLAH THE GOAT RAPING PIG FUCKER. Your still you, u still breath, u still move, your the same person from before I said that. The only difference is u may feel personally attacked but that’s your problem, if u don’t like what I have to say don’t listen, if u feel offended then leave. Grow the F up and learn to deal with people who differ from u instead of immediately picking a fight cause your too small a person to see things through other viewpoints.

Also, that whole insulting thing won’t happen in a place where your punished for it is a stupid argument. Your punished for going on a mass shooting, but those are still commonplace. The desire to control people with fear is only going to birth resentment and hatred towards u and hopefully they’ll overthrow u.

If u don’t want people to pretend to be Muslim let them leave. If u don’t wanna let them leave then get used to the fact they’re gonna be forced to pretend to be Muslim. This is like holding a gun to someone’s head, telling them to say they’re straight and expecting them to be honest with u when clearly they’re just gonna do what the crazy person with a gun will ask them to.

Second paragraph. ③ chances is pretty few for a lifelong decision, none of my questions have ever been answered, simply deferred (I.E. why’re u asking that, Muhammad had the right to do it, stop questioning me? Wtf?). “What more reason would they have to not come back?” How about the fact that they are given no choice in the matter and are practically... no literally being threatened with death for expressing their honest beliefs. That sounds like a great reason not to come back. Who wants to join something which’ll kill them for leaving.

Islam is the fastest growing religion because it’s patriarchal and treats women as commodities. Muslim women are thrust into the role of housewives, and seeing as men are allowed upto ④ ⊕ however many sexslaves they want, it’s not rocket science to conclude Muslims are proliferating at a huge rate. Raise all Muslim children atheist and Islam’ll be dead in 2 generations. The vast majority are only Muslim cause they were born Muslim &amp; they never leave because many don’t even know that’s an option (and in many places, it isn’t). Islam is the fastest growing only because Muslims are bred, not convinced."
429,e91iiso,"I'm assuming you're referencing the post from 6 days ago where one of the points you mentioned were that ""ex Muslim females need to stop playing the victim card because no one can force them to do what they don't want to do, ESPECIALLY in the U.S."" I chose to point this out to show you why people gave you the ""long face."" To enlighten you, Muslim females are born with the title ""Honor bearer"" meaning it's the family's responsibility to stop them from doing anything ""wrong"" or else they'd stain the family's name with shame. ""Wrong"" includes having a boyfriend, dressing ""inappropriately"", having guy friends, talking in a certain way, walking in a certain way, making eye contact with men for ""too long"", making skin contact with men and God forbid even hugging, staying home alone (yes, this happens a lot), going outside at night (or else she's gonna be called a whore), and the list goes on and on. Muslim women are destinied to be baby factories by both the religion and in countries where Muslims are the majority. In fact, Islam's look on women is so low, that even if they were to lick pus off of their husbands, it would not fulfill their ""duties"" to them.

""if a man were covered from head to foot with weeping sores oozing pus, and his wife were to come to him and lick his sores (to clean them), this would not fulfil the rights he has over her.’” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 12153; Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7725).

I believe that's enough for you to get the point. I won't address your other points because, just, wow. That's all I have to say.

"
430,e97qbcw,"Haha sorry about your freezing tits :P  And I’m sorry you hate being female :( that has to be hard.

I think what you’re saying makes perfect sense! I disagree with some of it, but it’s all totally understandable and it’s okay if we don’t agree on everything because your opinion is your own :) But yeah damn, that lady who called the cops on that kid was AWFUL lol. There’s a lot of awful stories like that. But I think what you’re mainly referring to is mostly “white feminism”, which is feminism that only cares about the needs and opinions of white cis women. And yeah, they can suck it tbh. I agree that there are some people out there that take the feminist movement back many steps by refusing to listen or communicate with people who disagree with anything they say. However, I don’t think that’s all feminists (I certainly hope I don’t come off that way, I care deeply about feminism but I want everyone to be able to access it and be a part of it, not just people who are exactly like me!) 

I think there are certainly obstacles we still face as women, but certain women face particular, unique obstacles and are often ignored in white-feminist discourse. Female sex workers are murdered at a rate 400 times that of the average working population, but their struggles are completely ignored. Black and trans women also face violence and harassment at vastly higher rates than other demographic groups. Muslim women are harassed for wearing their headscarves in public. These are just some examples, but the reason I bring them up is because the feminism you’ve seen— the cruel, exclusionary, narrow-minded feminism— is not MY feminism and frankly I’m glad it’s not yours either. But *feminism* as a general concept is still very much lovely and necessary, it just needs to be inclusive of the many diverse issues that different sociopolitical groups face as a result of their sex or their gender identity. I may not always be aware of the issues other demographics of women face because I haven’t had the same life experiences they have, but that’s why I think it’s important to listen to each other and work *with* each other (which I’m sad to say doesn’t tend to happen with exclusionary white-feminism).  

Like you said, we have a lot of work to do and need to keep pushing forward, but I certainly don’t think you’re excluded from feminism just because you’re questioning it :) We should be allowed to question feminism! Since when did challenging your own worldview become a bad thing? Isn’t free-thought what feminism is supposed to be about? I think we should always be skeptical of people who try to gatekeep an entire movement that actually belongs to everybody. You can identify however you want! If calling yourself a feminist feels scary and bad for you, then that’s okay. I wouldn’t be a very good feminist if I shamed you for that opinion :P But regardless of how you choose to identify, you ARE welcome in feminism and don’t let anybody tell you you’re excluded just because you aren’t satisfied with its current state. "
431,e6oe116,"But, those christian women weren't subjected to being beaten or murdered for taking it off. They weren't being forced to wear it. Muslim women are both of those."
432,e2uw9ru,"&gt;You are trying to link between them supposedly wanting to ""instill Quran and Sunnah"" as an excuse as to why they deserved to be mowed down. 

What..? Not at all my point. I am not lobbying for Muslim genocide.

&gt;Are you saying that Islam calls for more democracy and openness? If so, then what is the problem exactly? Isn't that what we all want?

No.

 &gt;Or are you saying that ""religious rule"" is oppressive and cruel. If so, how is that more democratic, as you say?

Again not what I am saying. I am not implying that religious rule is naturally more democratic.

&gt;governments sure as shit didn't have any problems doing any of the things you mentioned before, so let's not suddenly start pretending that it's unheard of.

I didn't say anything about whether it occurs or not. I am simply asking if you are saying foreign governments should meddle in foreign elections/political movements? I'm not sure if you are angry that governments do this, or angry that they don't. Or both?

&gt;They could condemn them publicly and openly in front of the world. They could refuse to have political ties to them. They could refuse to have economic ties to them. They could refuse to supply them with goddamn weapons and money.

Western nations certainly could sanction Egypt, but it is far too valuable as a geopolitical pivot. Sadly there is much more at stake in this than the fate of Egypt and nobody is going to be on the bad side of the Egyptian government for fear of losing position. Let's not go down this road though as the discussion will be too large of a focus.

&gt;Most Muslim people follow Islam's teachings just as well as they were taught centuries ago. Plenty of Muslim men and women live around the world, doing their thing and minding their own business, just like everybody else. Like it or not, Islam advocated for and demanded women's rights long before anyone else. That has not and will not change.

I would agree that most ""mind their own business like everybody else."" I would say most of every demographic is that way. I would also say that most do not strictly follow Quran/Islamic Law.

It's good that Islam took some of the earliest steps towards women's rights, I give them the proverbial cookie, but taking the earliest steps does not mean that you are holier-than-thou and can just stop progressing while the human rights situation still sucks.

Islamic law has many provisions that leave women at a clear disadvantage, very ironic since these same motions at the time of their creation in ~600s Arabia originally advanced women's rights versus the then existing norms. Under traditional Islamic law, child marriages are allowed and a girl could can be forced into marriage by a male relation. Women were legally required to be submissive and obedient to their husbands; if they're not, their husbands are entitled to beat them. Obedience includes never leaving the house without the husband's blessings; a husband can invoke the assistance of the police to forcibly return his wife to the home if she were is gone without his leave.

I think we can agree that MANY Muslims do not follow these rules ""...just as well as they were taught centuries ago"" right?

Mesopotamia actually holds the title for earliest recorded women's rights I believe, but that is superfluous. I don't like or dislike that Islam was an early advocate for women's rights, it is simply a datapoint. It is like asking if you like or dislike that stonehenge is composed of 75 pieces? That has not and will not change.

&gt;Islam can't be the backwards, oppressive religion that wants to kill everyone, but also be the one that started all of these freedoms. You can't have your cake and eat it too.

Uhh, yes they can. Your statement relies on the assumption that Islam has not changed in thousands of years. It has just like every other religion.

&gt;Considering how vile and cruel you make him sound, you should have zero problems providing a source for that.

My opinion of him is irrelevant to whether or not I have a source, but ok. I will add that I am giving you the benefit of not requesting sources, for say, Islam advocating for and demanding women's rights long before anyone else.

https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/16/muslim-brotherhood-abuses-continue-under-egypts-military

&gt;Having alterior motives is not up for discussion without tangible proof of his ""political moves"" to make it happen.

The ulterior* motive is to present yourself to voters in as positive a light as possible to gain more votes. Morsi had a TON to gain from positive PR.

&gt;I don't really understand why you would so aggressively belittle it.

Because it legit TRIGGERs me when I see people blindly drink the Kool-Aid. My reaction was over the top, but it pisses me off to see someone that is seemingly intelligent buy into this. Every single elected official has a motive to put charitable actions on blast, their literal job is at stake. 

It is easy (and therefore holds much less water as an act of sacrifice for the general good) to throw a ""donated salary"" to the general population when 99% of your job's compensation comes in the form of power.

Donald Trump donated his first term's salary to charity. Is he a kind, generous, and charitable individual based on that? You need a much broader view of someone to proclaim that they are trying to do good for their country. Enough on that though.

&gt;So when you say ""Sharia Law wants to kill you"", it is a not-very-subtle way of saying ""Islam wants to kill you"".

I don't think people hear ""Islam wants to kill you."" I think they hear - outlaw homosexuality (the story of Lot) and murder homosexuals (the Hadith), they hear permittable domestic abuse towards women (An-Nisa, 34), they hear ZERO protection for religious freedom, freedom of association and freedom of the press (Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, which was a REPLACEMENT to the UN Declaration on Human Rights as it was ""not compatible with Islam"" according to Muslim nations.) All of the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic shari'a.

&gt;This here is a classic strawman fallacy. All that says is ""percentage of people who want to live under sharia law"". 

I don't think you understand strawman fallacy. You were just saying that people shout sharia to spread Islamophobia, which I addressed with
&gt;You aren't even making a statement here on Sharia. You just say ""Everyone says Sharia to spread Muslim hate."" and then begin talking about Morsi again..?

I then added my own point about the popularity of sharia. I fail to see how I avoided your point and attacked a phantom point, as strawmanning does.

&gt;Question is, are we talking about Islam's teachings that originated all of the freedoms we discussed a few minutes ago, or the bullshit version propogated by KSA at the specific request of the west (link in my first comment)

I think it is fair to assume the words within the Quran account for the sharia polled, and I think that assumption is the more lenient option. I ignored the source earlier but I have to address it now, I don't think a nation-leader's statement on who is fucking up the world (spreading wahhabism)  is unbiased or to be fully trusted. I am not saying the West did or did not help spread wahhabism, simply that you provide a very weak source.

&gt;There are plenty of devoted Muslim women who are leaders in their fields worldwide, and they don't have a ""modernized version"" of Islam in their mind. It's just Islam, like it always was or will be.

I disagree with you strongly and believe that these Muslim women are using a version of Islam where they do not strictly obey the writings of the Quran. Just like modern Christians do not strictly obey the writings of the Old Testament.

&gt;If by islamist nation governments you mean the dictatorships that are funded and backed by the western nations that installed them, then yes. They absolutely represent them. Like it or not, the money/plan always traces back to the western big-boy nations.

No, I mean the islamist governments. I won't deny that many of these governments were installed by the west and many of them receive financial support from the west, but that does not mean at all that they represent them. The west does not have the power to send you money and limit how you spend it, as much as they like to think that. Just because the west installs a leader does not always mean they will obey the west unequivocally, nor does it mean that they will spend western financial aid in any particular way. The actions of a nation are THAT NATION'S responsibility. 

&gt;You tell me. After everything Muslims have been through, they have not and will not give up on Islam. It may be cheesy to say so, but truth and justice will always triumph in the end, no matter how bad it may look now. 

Excuse me, but this is cheesy bleeding-heart bullshit. You are a very romantic thinker. I can pull as many examples as you want of justice not triumphing or being served. You are literally propping the USA principle/propaganda of TRUTH! JUSTICE! LIBERTY! FOR ALL! It is a great goal, but not a reality.

&gt;Trying to distance those dictatorships from the western nations that installed them, or trying to paint them as anything more than spineless puppets is a waste of time and effort.

I definitely agree on this.

&gt;Your point here does not really address what I said. I said ""Islam demands that they be free"". You went on a tangent about how some people in Iran committed suicide. 

This is not a tangent whatsoever... You said ""Muslims have no problem with freedom, because Islam demands that they be free."" which implies that Muslims are all good with whatever Islam supports. I pointed out that Islam vehemently condemns suicide and all it required to change their belief in the Quran writings was a statement from an ayatollah in Iran.

&gt;What do you mean by ""democracy"" and ""liberty""? 

Use wikipedia.

&gt;and please show me proof of this claim after you explain what those words mean? 

Alright, here a couple on top of my head :

* 1 :

&gt;

    Six Tunisian students in Kairouan have been sentenced to three years of imprisonment and five years banishment from Kairouan on charges of homosexual activity. It is also understood that all six were subjected to an enforced rectal examination.

    One of the six received an additional six months for “violations of good morality”to his existing sentence for possession of computer video footage featuring homosexual acts, which breached Article 226 of Tunisia’s 1913 Penal Code.

    A gay Italian tourist, Angelo, was found murdered, stabbed repeatedly 10 times, in his holiday apartment in Hammamet, Tunisia. (1 August 2012)

* 2 :

&gt;

    2 young people less than 20years old had been kept by the police because they were kissing in a public area. The judge’s sentence was very strict: 2 months of jail for each of those two teenagers.

needless to say depending on how religious the parties are in the Parliament the sentencing could be more severe, we can't allow ourselves to be put on a religious watch, each person has his own interpretation of reality, i'm too lazy to mention the things going on in Iran or the ME.

In fact, just your reply makes me think you're delusional.

&gt;And what is wrong with Muslims in Muslim countries wanting their country to be ruled by Islam?

do you know what minority rights mean ?

&gt;And how does that make Tunisia a ""vague state""? 

Meaning it's laws change depending on the muslim party ruling it, for example [Al Nahdha](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%87%D8%B6%D8%A9_(%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3)), [Al Tahrir](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1) and [harakat wafe](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9_%D9%88%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A1_(%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3)) are all Islamic political parties that have different Islamic views that they want to impose, this makes the state's position on things unclear thus vague.

&gt;So do you want Tunisia to have a secular system like the one in France where Muslim women are banned from wearing hijab in public schools? 

Yes.

&gt;What the heck are you talking about? people who are not Muslim CAN eat in public in Muslim countries

Umm.. No ?

&gt;Um not really.

These didn't seem like arguments as much as biased opinion, You can still fully practice your religion in a secular system, you just don't impose them on people anymore, that's really it.

"
435,dzvhgrz,"Your post is a bit ridiculous.  Maybe that's the wrong word.  No one on earth can focus on every bad thing that happens.  You juxtapose so many different things I cannot even begin really.  However, if any of those things EXIST, they should be on news shows or documentaries where REALITY (which you so clearly want addressed) can be addressed.

Showtime or HBO or Netflix creating shows portraying a pregnant woman at the gallows IS torture porn.  Sorry.  There are countless porn studios in the world catering to all kinds of fetish.  Why a drama on TV takes these themes of complete victimization of women and makes them popular is not something I'm interested in anymore... I no longer watch this show.  

f you think THT is helping women in auras in Saudi Arabia, think again because that show is not seen by women there.  If you think muslim women are even allowed (in islam households) to watch this show, you are mistaken.  If you think the gay men in chechnya are watching, wrong again.  So, the people you say could be helped by the show's themes are not the ones watching it.  You complain of people ""turning away"" but how is anyone in an Iowa suburb coming away from THT except to be entertained?  They are not the ones seeing the ""message"" or taking that message to the streets about OPPRESSION of women and minorities.  The people who are seeing this show are 1) watching for entertainment and it means almost nothing 2) perverts who love seeing women slaughtered.

""Real World Plights"" as you say are non-applicable here.  We do not need to see constant murder, rape, abuse, subjugation, and every other thing that comes with this show.... we don't need to see that because it is NOT eliciting the response you apparently want.  It simply exists to shock and (for some) provide some twisted sexual arousal.

How you managed to factor in underprivileged inner city children, I don't get that.

With THT all I see is the unending stream of both menstrual blood and flesh blood.  Blood on walls, blood in bathtubs, blood caked on actors' faces and bodies, garments soaked in blood, congealed blood of corpses, bloody limbs and body parts removed, uterine blood from complications of pregnancy, blood from physical abuse, blood from self-mutilation, blood from toxic exposure........

Your ""privilege"" statement that people are turning away for not wanting to see it is rather inane.  Yes, we have the PRIVILEGE to look away from such things.... the same way you have the PRIVILEGE to watch it when women in pakistan or iran do not.  It may be time to acknowledge your own privilege.   

Please describe how your privilege of watching THT prompts you to go into the community or the world to relieeve the oppressed?  Does it?  When you watch THT do you then go into the community where you live and assist battered women?  Do you fly abroad to the countries you mentioned with an outreach mission?  Or is your post on reddit condemning others for the ""privilege"" to turn away the extent of your non-selective ignorance like the rest of us?

This show is a goreification of everything wrong with women being the object of harm.  The show narrative is SO DAMN SLOW whenever they have dead spots, they simply throw in some gruesome act toward another woman.  

Face it, THT is based completely off scenarios where anything can be done to any woman at any time and your a fan of the show.  You say it brings awareness and we are all being willfully ignorant.  But I personally do not live in a venn diagram (thank god) where any part of my life is touching such atrocities.  

This may piss some off but I have felt watching THT that somehow EVEN WOMEN are getting off on it.  Watching their female counterparts get obliterated while they have some ben &amp; jerrys and then get that good 8 hours before work in the morning.

Make a documentary about the atrocities of which you speak.  Such things really don't belong in serialized TV.  THT crossed the line too many times.  I get cable TV can show almost anything they want, but pandering to violence against women to people who CANNOT and probably WOULD NOT make any positive response to it is reprehensible."
436,dz5p8am,"&gt;Make morocco a secular country 

That’s a bad idea because it would be a *very* unpopular decision. And it would probably get you overthrown, humiliated, and murdered on video like they did to Gaddafi. 

Morocco already has secular influences, mixed in with Islamic influences. I like that way better than having only secular influences. I and the vast majority of Moroccans would not like it IF Morocco had a secular system like the one **in France where Muslim women are banned from wearing hijab in public schools.** Like WTH.... yeah no thank you with your secularism.

You show little to no empathy towards those impacted by racism but you empathize with the racists as oppressed. It does speak to your character whether you like it or not. An ad hominem would be placing a direct judgement and dismissing you based on your character, not saying that your beliefs speak to your character. 

It’s not a slippery slope to say that someone like Dylan Roof was directly influenced by white supremacists online who push the idea that black people are inferior to white people and violence against them is acceptable. Tell me this, is it a “slippery slope fallacy” to point out that young Islamic men are being radicalized by ISIS online and that Westerners are dehumanized as infidels in their propaganda? Please look at the trial records on Dylan Roof. You will see that dehumanizing and demonizing black people directly lead to him murdering people. Same in the case of the man who ran down protesters. He was directly involved in the same shitty, racist alt-right culture that Roseanne is upholding online. 

Your comparison of me mentioning white supremacists to Islamic extremists only holds water if I claimed that all white people or all Christians were white supremacists. I pointed out that white supremacy is directly linked to racial slurs and racism. I pointed out allowing that to fester without standing against that as a society is absolutely hurtful. You pride yourself on logic? Do better than that shitty comparison.

The dehumanizing of blacks people does lead to police shootings. It is part of the stereotype that leads police to treat black people differently and unnecessarily escalate situations. Look at the officer who shot the man who had a B.B. gun still in its packaging in a WalMart store. The fact that he went in shooting without asking questions or trying to discover any more information should be a hint that was based on the predisposed notions he had. 

Words are powerful and words matter. Go research the impact of propaganda throughout history and its consequences and tell me that words have no power. "

Hijab and burka show Muslim women have self respect and modesty. Western women who don't ascribe to these ideals are by default imoral and immodest.

Middle class guardian readers though think it's racist to point that very basic thinking that runs though even the moderate community.

That's why even in court these girls are called slags and whores by their rapists.

British Muslim women are murdered by their families for having boyfriends.

It's all connected to controlling women. 

But instead  we are talking about BBC presenters being payed abit less, or flirtatious comments and knee touching 20 years ago. Where's the feminist outrage? 
"
439,dur2ug7,"&gt; Christianity as it happened, and anyone who currently believes in the religion as it existed then.

...except that Islam says Jesus was not the son of God, just a prophet, and has a tiny problem with the Trinity.

&gt; The jizya is considered an old practice which is not done today.

On the contrary, it is.  It was done by ISIS, and is currently being done in Egypt by the Muslim Brotherhood against Coptic Christians.

&gt; When it was done, it was considered to be equal to a tax 'Zakat' that Muslims paid.

Not even close.

&gt; In a much more tribal existence, people were paying for protection.

Yes, protection from the Muslims they lived among.

&gt; Most importantly, those who could not afford DID NOT pay. 

That was true of the zakat, NOT of jizya.  ...and in fact, while the jizya had a minimum, there was no maximum - so the Muslim ruler could set it at whatever he liked.  Those who could not pay were sold into slavery along with their families.

&gt; A Muslim is allowed to marry a non Muslim without them having to convert.

Yes, there are many examples of such marriages, which began immediately after Muslims had murdered the womens' families and taken the women captive.  It is allowed because in Islam, a wife is subordinate to her husband.  For the same reason, Muslim women are not allowed to marry non-Muslim men.

&gt; I'm curious as to where you got your knowledge, because you know a lot but it seems like you learned for offense only.

Years of study.  I spent a little time in Saudi Arabia back in the early 1980s, but I didn't really start learning about Islam until after 9/11/01.  I was involved in a discussion board then, and argued against those who were saying that the people who did it were not insane criminals, but rather were Muslims acting in accordance with their faith.

In order to argue against them effectively, I had to learn about and come to understand Islam - and the more I learned, the more I discovered I had been wrong."
440,duxya5e,"Muslim women are imprisoned or raped or murdered for taking these off in the east.

And then there's these fuckwits. "
441,du9ipo6,"The bottom line here is that you are aligning yourself with a doctrine that you clearly know nothing about. You haven't read the Qur'an, you haven't acquainted yourself with Hadiths of any sort, you know nothing about the most revered man in Islam, and you have no idea how the faith is venerated.

So the question that comes to mind is *why*? Why are you acting as an apologist for something you know nothing about?

As someone who has studied Islam extensively, I cannot fathom how you see fit to attempt to defend an ideology when you haven't the slightest idea what it's about, and it's painfully obvious that you don't.

It's truly horrific. There are calls to murder the unbeliever peppered throughout the text - a text that is called ""perfect"" by every practicing Muslim. Women are treated as chattel throughout the text, given subhuman status and told they should be covered, quiet, and beaten and accept it. The jurisprudence - touted as God's own perfect law - is barbaric and ruthless.

Muhammad, the most revered man in Islam, was a highway robber, rapist, child rapist, slaver, sex slaver, torturer, greedy son of a bitch who killed anybody who so much as spoke out against him or his death cult.

This is the reality of Islam. If you believe otherwise, you have been lied to.

This is not opinion. This is not speculation. This is 100% demonstrable truth.

So, again, why do you think it's okay to defend such an ideology?"
442,dsshpzr,"I live in the united states but have visited sweden annually my whole life.

No actually guys like Soros profit from instability &amp; that's why his organization, OpenEurope chooses to ""rescue"" with Boats military aged men who demonstrate to be risk taking by getting in boats &amp; illegally crossing the mediterranean. That's not to say the people that crossed the mediterranean should be blamed or that they are going to be *mostly* criminals but rather George Soros relies on this method of selection because it is most likely to find, &amp; select for, the **RARE** criminally inclined migrant as it has been proven that criminally inclined individuals are more likely to be risk takers. Again not to say that risk takers are all criminally inclined &amp; I surely might do the same thing if I was in the same situation! Again they are  NOT all bad people &amp; **the overwhelming majority ARE GREAT PEOPLE**.. Most are great! &amp; some of my best friends ATM are immigrants that got to their country by illicit means &amp; I think that it's only ethical to provide amnesty to them &amp; that deportation is unethical. 

But a welfare state is not stable or sustainable with infinite immigration. It's not rocket science. If you have a castle on the top of a hill &amp; you start giving out free bread &amp; providing living quarters to anyone who shows up.. How long before word spreads &amp; you are overwhelmed with people asking or even demanding the same kind of help!? We can only provide **so much.** A small european country can only provide *so much!* Now their citizens **are** going to have to make sacrifices that they otherwise would not have because they need more money for social services. In the immediate future that means higher taxes **less social services available for native citizens of the country &amp; immigrants *that are already there*** In the long term though it means economic regression &amp; **total collapse.** At this rate it's inevitable. 

The idea always was that a country like Sweden was more stable &amp; resistant to recessions (as well as limiting growth) but they have limits even on their stability &amp; the economic shrinkage is becoming exponential decay now &amp; it's just a matter of time before it enters a death spiral, even though their beacuratic goons pretend like they don't know exactly that. Most government types just want to keep their jobs but the top bureaucratic goons are actually hoping for disaster because they think they can ride chaos to profit like S0R0S did in Ukraine &amp; they are not tied down to any one area.. that's why they are called globalists! Unless major industrial advancements take place, Europe really is fucked &amp; even then the leaders will just try to fuck it some more! That's why **industrious people that are not in their little authoritarian club usually move ELSEWHERE!** Even south america seems to be growing more at this point or other emerging markets like Singapore or even Puerto Rico! 

And crime rates *have* been going up in correlation to the immigrant waves, but again that is not racist to say because it's obvious that only a very very very small amount of them are criminals &amp; the statistics do not lie &amp; surely it cannot be racist to talk about statistics.. In fact the global ""criminal mean"" is probably close to what it is in America. It's not racist to suppose that people who grew up in situation that was more violent could possibly have a greater proportion of people that acquired violent coping mechanisms or ptsd. Compared to America Sweden was a jewel with almost no crime but that is rapidly changing &amp; **it's approaching the global violence mean.** 

They made America look like a *shithole.* **I live in the united states but have visited sweden annually my whole life.** Sweden is becoming America tier. I have witnessed multiple violent altercations &amp; one of them was started by a swede. Swedes are becoming violent themselves, as they learn new coping skills that they would not have had to before &amp; suffer traumas. Inevitably the country will be just like America, especially **without a social safety net because the citizens refuse to form voluntary networks** of social aide instead of relying on an inept government to take of them with the false assumption rich people pay for most of it.. haha yeah right!

The Swedish government tells the citizens to submit to attackers &amp; it's illegal to fight back or even defend yourself in the slightest way! I know someone that did a year in prison for defending himself from muggers (i wont say what race or if they were immigrants) &amp; **when he was with WOMEN.** In Sweden women are taught to let men rape them &amp; would actually face prison time if they fought back. It really is worse than Trump said, although not nearly as much about individual immigrants who are often great people but more about a corrupt &amp; disaster seeking, almost suicidal, bureaucracy. Swedes try to downplay it but some are honest but I visit there many times a year &amp; know firsthand. 

Firearms would prevent this kind of tyranny coming from the government! Firearms are the most basic forms of defense **&amp; have been demonstrated to lower crime with increased ownership** among the population of some communities. Guns help if the community has any cohesion at all. The latest church shooting in texas was stopped by a civilian with a gun! &amp; the **prime reason for gun deaths in America is gang violence &amp; black market surrounding drugs**. Governments promote gangs and drugs. Ask yourself why is heroin cheaper than ever after we saw pictures of American troops guarding poppy fields &amp; Hamid Karzai's (president of afghanistan) brother was caught trafficking heroin. Coincidence? Look up Freeway Rick Ross... He has **direct** evidence the CIA sold Crack in Compton, Los Angeles, California.

I know people that grew up in ""white trash"" trailer parks in the USA who suffered violence &amp; these people, as nice as they are, are the kinds of people that are used to violence &amp; know how to cope with it *in violent ways.* Swedes usually were raised in safe, *privileged* environments. **I'm not saying immigrants are like this** but if even some of the white people I knew went there it would be like a **""wolf in the sheep's pen.** I would never ever advocate for white Americans to move to places like Sweden! Because I know they would irrevocably change it for the worse!

The problem is that even a relatively small amount of criminally averse people can vastly change what used to be a Utopia like Sweden. I doubt immigrants would have much effect on America because it's *approaching* the global mean of violence but, again, I would never advocate for massive waves of Americans coming to Europe! **Tbh I am not a big fan of inviting more MEN to the party!** As a man myself I like it better when there are more women around! That is just a fact.  Most of the immigrants coming to Europe now are men (80 percent) &amp; that can adversely affect the *pole to hole ratio*! It's ok 4 people 2 have dating biases. That is not racist and it's not prejudice to say that I want less men, overall, in my country. **If it was ethical I would deport millions of Swedish men from the country so I would have a better time dating Swedish women.** Also, Muslim women are not likely to date European men because their families won't usually let them. 

Anyway you can get Soro's playbook by researching his actions during the Ukraine uprising. Also that's not free market libertarian capitalism but rather authoritarian globalist chaos instigating crony capitalism. It's absolutely 100 percent true that there are factions of ""elite"" authoritarians that manipulate their powers in a way that causes instability in Europe &amp; America. They think they can ride the wave of chaos to benefit themselves. In fact the Rothschilds infamously profited massively from *both* world wars &amp; a lot of people think they helped/encouraged Hitler's rise to power. 

Because a few Jewish people do something bad that doesn't mean all Jewish people are bad ofc. **Their race and religeon has nothing to do with it and same goes with immigrant violence.** There are just as many elite mischief makers that are protestant. Ironically and hypocritically these bad actors like Merkel will use **hate speech laws is a way for them to terrorize the citizenry.**

And **immigrants that gain voting rights are more likely to vote for parties that support more immigration specifically because of tribalist instincts** (foolishly because instability doesn't help them anymore than it helps native euros) which is a **total positive feedback loop!** They have created a situation where the more immigrants that come in the easier it is to get more immigrants to come in! I don't hate them as individuals AT ALL but anyone with half a brain can see how this self perpetuating chain of events can become a ""runaway train"" with no brakes to stop a possible derailment!

443,dst5su4,"&gt; The thing is you can't force every muslim women to wear headscarves. They could have medical condition or whatnot and to punish them without finding out the reason from them is as much as problem it is. 

That's the catch-22 situation.  You can't force them all but doing that would be going against the religion. So what's it going to be?

&gt; If this is your reasoning, then are you allowing the act of murder for something petty?

I'm not allowing anything.  The Muslim women are allowing all this to happen because they didn't protest against the belief.  Extreme beliefs breed extreme actions.  I find it weird when they only condemn the man's actions without acknowledging the reason for his actions.  Not saying the man was right but why stop there?

There's bound to be people who will support the man's actions because the rules are clear and he's just being a 'good' Muslim. How does one argue against that?  In the end, the Muslim community will be torn apart by this debate."

447,dr63kxq,"That is an extremely generic comeback rooted in an inability to see beyond your confirmation bias. You see one x happening with y group and you attribute x to the entire group. In this case you attributed it to refugees, but this can be used in a variety of scenarios. For Example:


&gt; America is not some dystopian murder filled hellhole because of guns
Sad, the victims of mass shootings would disagree

&gt;America is not some dystopian hellhole because of religion
Sad, the victims of homophobia would disagree

&gt;American is not some dystopian hellhole because of cops
Sad, the victims of police violence would disagree

Simply put, hear of an event and instead of looking at a larger picture and realize that this is not commonplace, you retreat to a groupthink that is devoid of outside perspective. Additionally, you lack the critical thinking skills necessary to look past the false reality presented to you by your confirmation bias. The truth is that Europe is doing just fine, and is aiding in a humanitarian crisis when called upon.


But lets look past this for the moment. You are right in the fact that Islamic nations do not have the same concept of morals as secular western societies do. However, the extent of the differences are highly exaggerated. It should be obvious that not all Islamic men are rapist no more than all frat guys are rapists. By introducing these Islamic peoples to go greater western secularism, we have an opportunity to erode away at undesirable traits inside of the religion. However, this cannot be accomplished if Western society becomes unwelcoming and hostile towards these refugees. 
To summarize, by offering shelter to those displaced by violence, Europe is showing itself to be a model for humanity, and is presenting a chance to end undesirable traits associated with Islam. "
448,do1ebyf,"I'm proposing that the current set of non-governmental policies that have a profound impact on Muslim women are hugely harmful and enormously widespread.

http://www.dw.com/en/europe-grapples-with-honor-killings/a-1244406

Let us not forget that while in many cases women see a value in modesty, and some Muslim women very much enjoy wearing conservative clothing and a hijab or niqab as it frees them from the sexualization that can happen to women in public, breaking from standards of conduct for women in Islam can mean a death sentence.

To assume that occasionally they are murdered, but that there isn't more minor physical violence used to encourage compliance is absolutely living denial. I'm not saying I have good data on how much these women are being beaten, and I'm in no way saying all Muslims beat women for choosing not to wear hijab, niqab, burka or other regional choices, but it is definitely happening. There is also evidence to suggest that social ostracization and alienation are more damaging than direct pressure.

449,dq43f41,"I’ll certainly agree with you that there are a lot of bigots. My question is, in the great scheme of things, why does it matter?  Assuming that the bigot isn’t a murderer or whatever (and murderers come in all shapes, sizes, races, and hatreds- they have mental problems) then why do you care?

If I’m a woman who hates men, men may get angry about it. They may pound their fists because they cannot stand to hear men spoken of negatively. But it’s not actively harming them. This isn’t an elementary school playground and real life doesn’t always play nice. 

People judge others by their own experiences (much like someone who was thrown by a horse may avoid horses in the future). If I was gang raped by a group of Islamic men, I would probably avoid Islamic men. Like, big time. Many Islamic men are nice people!  But that wouldn’t change my experience or perception of them. 

I say this because someone’s opinions about others races don’t matter. There are ALWAYS assholes out there. Always. An opinion means nothing. I feel like there are more important things to worry about than if my neighbors secretly hate Mexicans and actually don’t even give a fuck if they do. If someone put up a sign in their front yard that said “mexicans go home” it wouldn’t impact me and it also wouldn’t impact any Mexicans!  At all!  It’s a sign. Who cares.

451,dlpu8oc,"I didn't read many of the comments, so I apologize if I repeat anything. I think you need to meet more people. You were very honest that you have these biases, but why does the responsibility to change them rely on us feminists? Why don't you take time to meet new people? Have you ever gone up to a Muslim woman and had a conversation with her? Maybe you should try and eventually those biases will fall away. 

As for your generalizations at the bottom. I know plenty of empathetic men, plenty of strong women, and I've actually never met a black murderer before...

Have you tried to meet these people? Have you talked to strong women or black people? Have you held a conversation with a male nurse? These people aren't rare. Actually, your generalizations are rarer. Most black people do not kill...most white people dont kill. But do you see how you treat the two differently? Let's use Charlottesville as an example. When that woman died, I'm sure you didn't go ""oh my god ANOTHER white person killed someone."" No, you didn't connect the crime to a race. Most likely you connected the crime to a radical person. But if a black person murders someone you probably will say ""oh my god ANOTHER black person killed someone.""  That tells me you need to meet more black people. You need to go out and talk to these people and go against your inaccurate biases. 

But until you do that, just know that you have more control over your biases than you think. In a situation like seeing a Muslim woman, your first thought is what you are conditioned to think and the thought right after that is how you truly want to think. So if your conditioned thought right now is ""ahh Muslim women are scary"" you have the control to change that second thought and say ""now that's just silly. This woman has done nothing to me.""

Oh really? it seemed like you really needed a goddamn reminder there. 
I feel like i have to repeatedly point out that i'm no fan of hijab or anything that it represents again and again because you keep talking as if i approve of it -_-
so again NO i do not think it empowers women NO i don't think it's a feminist symbol NO i don't think it should be celebrated.

Those women achieved something uncommon which is finding a middle ground between a highly toxic partiachal religion and integrating in the wes0 THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE CELEBRATING t and i think it's a good thing because what is the alternative? being fucking baried alive, no dreams, no passion, no hope. nothing. Just more blind conformism to what a hijabi or a muslim women is supposed to be like..honestly how do you even imagine this goes? do you really think Islam is just going to go poof and dissapear and then bam all the chicks turns super liberal!
No this is a sign that muslim women are slowly integrating and taking roles previously were very hard for them to take. Will it kill you for successful and beautiful hijabis to become more mainstream?? that's literally a huge improvement for millions of women already.
The stereotypical good muslimah is a woman of broken will and broken dreams and that stereotype must be fought. That's all there is to it.

&gt;Hijab is oppressive, and that's it. That's the message we need to spread

No hijab is only opressive when forced there is a nuance to be seen. I lived most my life in the Ben Ali regime and i've known relatives and aquentances who went to jail, lost their jobs, their education for wearing hijab. I will never advocate the ridiculous message that hijab is only ever opressive and that's it.

454,dkl70sm,"Dude. You are tripping.

We can make reasoned critiques of Richard Dawkins' thinking without lumping him in together with a bunch of Bellamy salute throwing throwbacks who want to ""kill all normies"" and who systematically perpetrate real political violence against anyone that doesn't toe their line, and then call the people who refuse to take that shit ""oppressive.""

In my opinion he does make some sweeping generalizations about Islam - and that goes hand-in-hand with his openly stated cause of advancing atheism in the world, because *he* believes that's the most rational and reasonable world to live in - but ultimately he doesn't really understand how diverse and divergent Islam can be and he hasn't really seen everything that Islam is. He hasn't had enough exposure to Islam to understand just exactly what it is anyway.

There is a measure of legitimacy in his critique of ""the regressive left"" and of Islamic fundamentalists, and just because he makes those critiques doesn't mean that he's ""alt-right."" He has never espoused white nationalism and he's certainly never identified himself as a mainstream conservative, let alone a far-right conservative who rejected mainstream conservatism in favor of the alt-right.

&gt;I have indeed strongly condemned the misogyny, homophobia, and violence of Islamism, of which Muslims — particularly Muslim women — are the prime victims. I make no apologies for denouncing those oppressive cruelties, and I will continue to do so.

That's the jist of his whole critique. He's not wrong. People who profess to be Muslim even up to this day treat women, sexual minorities, and non-Muslims *horribly*.

Edit: sorry, I neglected to mention, the vast majority of the murder victims of ISIS have been *other Muslims!!* I may not agree that all of Islam should be 'done away with' or something to that effect, but I know the difference between criticism of Islam and racist white nationalism when I see it."

Islamists have infiltrated Western governments and activists like Linda Sarsour are rallying up useful idiots to gather support for their cause. Only an idiot could throw on a hijab and consider it ""solidarity"", while ignoring that Muslim women are murdered in the Middle East for their refusal to wear them. The media is heavily promoting them, constantly failing to mention that she is a Sharia Law proponent who has threatened FGM survivors, and shaming anyone who disagrees as an Islamophobe. Thank god we're not in Europe where that rhetoric is criminalized. But rest assure that they will undoubtedly try to push the measures. 

Just look at the media's reaction to FGM taking place right in Detroit or the mass murder of 3 whites by a Nation of Islam member. It was nonexistent. Instead, they pick up immediately on 'TRUMP SUPPORTERS RIP OFF HIJABS' with zero evidence or witnesses. Even when they get debunked, they'll still run stories on how hate crimes have picked up.

This is very real. Stop it before it's too late.

459,fzsdycw,"The thing is, Nike spends billions on advertising(3.75B in 2019). *It's deliberate, they didn't have to use a frame of a niqabi transitioning to an LGBT flag bearer*. This single frame is politically/morally/ideologically charged. Remember that a group of people sat in a room and deliberated on this and felt that a niqabi transitioning to an LGBT flag bearer was appropriate. It takes away from the autonomy of our faith. Who are they to decide the narrative and speak for us? Is our faith so loose that anyone can hijack it and misrepresent it for their needs?

The words and sentiment are problematic as well and do more damage to niqabi's than it does to help. It's a classic Hollywood/media trope; *Muslim women are oppressed and sad and unable to express themselves*. Literally, every Hollywood movie that depicts Muslims is trash. Remember Hala? (I never saw it). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INwnpsvTuJU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INwnpsvTuJU) They're essentially saying Muslim women had/have no place in sports, which is fallacious. Where in our beautiful deen does it say women can't do sports? Aisha(RA) raced the prophet peace be upon him. I know of a girl who hunts and skins deer and rabbits with her dad(hunting isn't a sport).

Essentially all this ad does is perpetuate the stereotype that Muslim women are oppressed. And an athletic apparel company should not be voicing/depicting religion at all. But they're doing precisely to garner more sympathy from Muslims, so they can make more sales. Capitalism is about selling to as many people as possible. *So Nike doesn't really care about Muslim women's struggles, all they care about is profit, this ad is just a crutch, don't be fooled.* Otherwise, they would boycott china, help the Uyghurs and you'd see them more involved in Muslim oriented charity work. But they aren't involved in any of this.

TL: DR You should be angry that they're misrepresenting women in Islam."
460,fdc63e3,"I'd say many Arab countries were a lot more liberal during the 60s and 70s. Those were times of great liberation, especially female, around the world. The Arab world saw debates between Marxists, capitalists, secularists and the religious. But what happened after that? Islamic scholars gained a foothold, and, often through violence, installed more strictly religious societies. This can be seen in pretty much every Arab, and also other Islamic countries, like Iran (where the Shiite even hijacked a Marxist revolution), Pakistan or Afghanistan.

The Sunnah dictates clearly how a woman should dress, and while it is true that there is no direct physical punishment for a woman that would reject Hijab, she will face strong societal stigma, and possible punishment inside the family, which might be even worse. As to the sexual assault: Cultures that try to control the sexual behaviour of the people will face those problems. Islam also differentiates between Muslima and non Muslima. And non-muslim women are often considered 'fair game' because of Muhammad's actions - he took numerous sexual slaves from his conquests, next to his numerous wives (4 are allowed in Islam, but the prophet may have more. The number varies in different Hadiths, from 13-18, if I remember correctly.).

The last thing I want to tell you, is, that Islam IS culture. It is the dominating factor under which, especially, Arab societies developed. Islam has an answer for everything, and thus the all their cultures are heavily intertwined with it, despite have regional differences, certainly. Sometimes stronger, sometimes lesser, but the common ground are always the Islamic traditions, which of course may also vary in the way they are enforced, but they are always there.

I blame Islam, because these issues were among the many that drove me away from it. I grew up with Islam.

Edit for structure."

Honestly, I pray to Allah this is a troll. But deep down, if I’m honest with myself, I know this is my worst fear for after ten, twenty years of marriage. 

I know he mentioned surgery which is kind of ridiculous. But really, if she’s not willing to put effort in, what can you do except offer up more options? He wants her to work out, diet and put effort into her aesthetics. I know it seems simple  to do but the sad reality is that many Muslim women are not willing to do even this much. 

We need to stop being idealistic as a community and look at what is happening. Why men commit infidelity. Why women do. Yeah, there’s nothing specific to one gender here. It’s a cultural practice. Not going to point fingers but, most of us posting here live in a western country, so that’s what we have to adapt to and live by."
462,e2g1dvw,"Maybe we could come to an agreement. Moat mosques in europe tend to have socail gatherings for all communities, at leat the ones in london do. Try maybe taking sometime to include yourself in them. Get to know your fellow dutch muslims. I can assure some of your ideas that they dont integrate or cant speak the language would be dispelled. Maybe the older generation but not the new ones. They all would speak flemish. In london the muslim community is very well integrated and all speak english. Maybe the really older generation has a problem with communication but not the new. They all have friends of different culture and creed. It is important to realise that statistically muslim women are the most vulnerable to attacks by islamaphobes, than men. Overwhelmingly it is always women who are attacked by policies. I understand that this law hasnt been passed through and the likes of Gert Wilders is hijacking it by calling it the burka ban law but ask yourself one thing. If someone like Gert is trying his best to put his thumbprint on this specific law, how helpful is it really and who does it really affect?"

**Opinion: BJP's Hypocrisy In Seeking Credit For Triple Talaq Ban** 

 ______ 
The 395-page judgement of the Supreme Court on the triple

_talaq_

issue ends with a short order: "" In view of the different opinions recorded,
by a majority of 3:2 the practice of

_talaq-e-bidat - _

triple

_ talaq_

is set aside."" It is signed by all the five judges involved, namely Jagdish
Singh Khehar (Chief Justice), Kurian Joseph, Rohinton Fali Nariman, Uday Umesh
Lalit and S. Abdul Nazeer.

The arguments are extensive and will require further reading and study, and he
three judges who gave the majority judgement reached the same conclusion,
though on different grounds. But it can be unambiguously stated that the
majority judgement is most welcome and is a significant step forward for
women's rights.

This order constitutes a victory for the secular struggle for women's rights.
Any judgement which enhances the rights of women of one community certainly
impacts positively on all women. Muslim women have been in the forefront of
the struggle against what they consider a patriarchal misinterpretation of
Koranic tenets such as the

_talaq-e-bidat_

form of divorce which is instant and arbitrary, and all credit to their
struggle and that of democratic women's organisations like AIDWA who took up
this issue many decades ago and campaigned in a sustained manner among Muslim
women.

In the face of the struggle of Muslim women, the Muslim Law Board was forced
to change its stand. It had to shift from its utterly reprehensible and
objectionable first affidavit which demeaned women and glorified male
supremacist arguments. Its last affidavit agreed that the practice was
""sinful"" and it pledged to prevent its use. The affidavit stated, ""At the time
of performing

_Nikkah_

(marriage), the person performing the

_Nikkah_

will advise the bridegroom/man that in case of differences leading to

_talaq_

, (he) shall not pronounce three divorces in one sitting since it is an
undesirable practice in Shariat."" Even if this was just a last ditch attempt
to prevent an adverse court verdict, its position is there on record. It would
be in the best interests of the Board to accept the court verdict and to
cooperate in its implementation.

The reactions of BJP leaders are amusing, hailing it as their victory. It is
nothing of the sort. The court has maintained a fine balance between the
protection for personal laws granted by the constitution and judicial
intervention. In the majority judgement too, the judgement is careful to point
out that it is related to only one type of triple

_talaq, talaq-e-bidat_

, which it found arbitrary and not intrinsic to Koranic tenets. It did not
accept the efforts and arguments of the Attorney General representing the
central government to widen the scope of the court intervention to other
aspects of divorce under Muslim personal law. The efforts to bring in
arguments in favour of the Uniform Civil Code were also not taken into
consideration by the Court. In fact, the Chief Justice of India made a
specific mention of the arguments of the Attorney General and made an implicit
warning against a ""cascading effect."" He spoke specifically about the
contention of the Attorney General that ""all forms of

_talaq_

suffered from the same infirmities as have been expressed as

_talaq-e-bidat_

"".

The majority judgement is clear that it is only discussing triple

_talaq_

and not all forms of

_talaq_

under Muslim Personal law. It is this which has been held to not be ""essential
practice to the religion."" A large number of countries with a majority Muslim
population do not have this practice including Pakistan, Bangladesh. In his
separate judgement also decreeing that the practice, which is against the
tenets of Quran cannot be permitted, Justice Kurien held that ""the power of
the legislature has to be exercised within the constitutional parameters
without curbing religious freedom guaranteed under the Constitution of India.""

It would be typical of the BJP and its narrow reading of women's rights to
attempt to hijack struggles of minority women for reforms in their personal
laws and to insert their own agenda, namely, to impose a uniform civil code.

On the contrary, it is reforms in personal laws, such as reflected in the
Supreme Court judgement, of all communities which can best suit the present
situation.

Uniformity is not equality and a uniform civil code is no guarantee for
justice. On the contrary, under this government, even secular laws applicable
to all women presently in the IPC are being sought to be diluted such as
Section 498A. In the name of prevention of misuse of the law, the law itself
is sought to be scrapped. The government is refusing to bring a law against
honour killings. These examples are an indication of the approach of this
government to the concerns of women.

The Uniform Civil Code will only be another stick to beat the minorities with,
to isolate them and to put women within these communities on the defensive.
Muslim women are ready and leading the struggle for reform within their
personal laws. All personal laws require reform including laws relating to
Hindu women such as the Guardianship law. Today's judgement gives strength to
crusaders for reforms

**Indian Muslim woman: She is looking within and stepping out** 

 ______ 
Safia Jamal first wore the hijab at 20, when she moved from her hometown of Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh to Delhi, for her graduation. “I lived in a small locality back home, but this was the first time I felt uncomfortable,” she says. “People stared on the streets, passed comments, so I opted to cover myself.”

Religion may have been only one of the factors for her, but others did not see it the same way. While she was studying MCA at an all-women’s university near Jaipur, a male teacher told her to “dress properly” for a viva. Taken aback, Safia asked him what he meant. “He told me, remove that ‘round thing’ you wear around your head, you don’t have to show you’re Muslim here”.

As a ‘visible’ Muslim woman, Safia often runs up against prejudice, from those who question her decision to wear a hijab, and very often, from those who expect her to behave a certain way because of it.

Twenty-seven year old Saman Quraishi is familiar with this dilemma. “I am a hijab-wearing Muslim woman, who dances the salsa, goes to Midnight Mass, makes rangoli and has friends who are boys. I don’t know why people find this so difficult to digest,” she says.

In a political climate where triple talaq is a hot-button issue on daily television news, Muslim women are suddenly at the centre of mainstream discourse. But what are their concerns and apprehensions?

THE ROAD TO EMPOWERMENT

“Education, education, education”, says Kouser Fatima, a Bangalore-based dentist who curates Muslim Voices India, a crowd-sourced Twitter handle. “Muslim women need to think of educating themselves, their daughters because this is where the community lags behind.”

Numbers tell the same story. The total number of literate Muslim women is 51.8%, as against the national average of 55.9% for all religious communities. The gap is wider for higher education.

A 2007 study commissioned by the Ministry of Women and Child Development found the main factors contributing to low enrolment and high incidence of drop outs among Muslim girls were a combination of poverty, absence of separate girls’ school, conservative attitudes and early marriages.

For Safia, coming to Delhi for a BSc degree from Jamia Millia Islamia was not negotiable. “My elder sister is the first woman graduate in my family. The extended family and neighbours back home didn’t approve, but my parents were supportive of our decision,” she says.

Safia recently moved to Banglaore in search of a job. And when she was in Delhi, she learned to navigate the big city alone, taking tuition classes for pocket money or just hanging out with friends at nukkad chai stalls. “In Kheri, I didn’t do anything. There were no challenges, nothing to do,” she says.

Samreen Hussain, who teaches law at Ram Manohar Lohia National Law University in Lucknow, echoes this. “Muslim women need education to broaden their horizons,” she says.

Things are changing, she feels. In her batch at Aligarh Muslim University’s law college in 2009, most women were studying with the full support of their family. Most of her classmates work now – as judges, in PSUs, as teachers, or lawyers. “Women need to step out into the world so they can break patriarchal norms,” she says.

WORKING FOR A FUTURE

If the numbers in higher education are low, the poor representation of Muslim women in the workforce is shocking. According to 2001 Census figures, the work participation rate for Muslims in general was the lowest at 31.3, eight points lower than the national average. But Muslim women’s presence was a miniscule 14.1, compared to the national average of 25 for women. As per Census 2011, 85% of Muslim women are not part of the workforce.

In 2000, Syeda Saiyidain Hameed, former member of planning commission, authored Voice of the Voiceless, a report on the status of Muslim women. Seventeen years later, the needle hasn’t moved much. “No miracles have been created for Muslim women as far as government schemes are concerned. The biggest challenge facing them is dire, abysmal poverty,” says Hameed.

Most Muslim Women in India are self-employed in sewing, embroidery, chikan kari, zari, beedi or agarbatti rolling, but the work is usually sub-contracted and poorly paid. “There is a lack of skill and livelihood, when it is there, is meagre,” explains Hameed.

To make matters worse, ever so often, some obscure cleric pipes up with a fatwa that women should not work outside, making things even more complicated.

Safia points to another reason. “In our community, a girl’s security and settlement is not a job, but marriage,” she says. “A lot of distant relatives tell my mother, your eldest daughter is 27, she’s past the marriageable age.”

REPRESENTATION MATTERS

“The triple talaq debate is an example of how the All India Muslim Personal Law Board missed an opportunity for reform,” says Hameed. “We need better representation of women in these bodies. Not women that are just rubber stamps, but who have an agency or voice of their own.”

The All India Muslim Women’s Personal Law Board was formed in 2005, but has hardly ever taken a position contrary to the Board.

Like in religion, politics too is strewn with hurdles for women.

Back in 2013, Saman was figuring out what to do with life after finishing a social work degree from Mumbai’s Tata Institute of Social Sciences. One day, her father asked if she would like to attend a political rally by Arvind Kejriwal near their home in Old Delhi’s Daryaganj.

“When I reached there, I was among a handful of women. It was such a novelty that I was invited on the stage and asked to give a speech,” she recounts. Saman’s speech on women’s safety moved Kejriwal so much, he invited her to join AAP. She worked for the party’s outreach, and since she was too young to contest at 23, was made the campaign manager for Matia Mahal.

“For the first campaign meeting, people said they couldn’t come before 10 because of special Ramzan prayers. No one believed me when I said, I will come at 10.30 at night,” says Saman. But slowly, word spread that she was, indeed, at every campaign meeting – the sole young woman among 60-odd men, an indicator of how women are missing from politics.

“They listened to me because I had conviction. But soon enough, the character assassination and personal comments started,” she says. Saman quit AAP two years later, disillusioned with politics, but her stint taught her that men hold a lot of sway over how women vote.

For Kausar, the issue of representation is one she wrangles with every day, on social media. Here, as in other areas, representation matters. “I feel we have to engage, most people are really ignorant. But the kind of anti-Muslim vitriol you see online, I have never seen in real life,” she says.

Kausar also has to field the occasional backlash from anonymous Muslim men, uncomfortable with the idea of a woman speaking out openly. “Our issues are hijacked by Muslim men or liberal, feminist voices who very often look down upon the same people they claim to defend. Muslim women need to form a community and reclaim our own voice,” she says.

(This is Part 4 of HT’s series #BeingMuslimNow. Part 1 explored the alienation and mistrust among Muslims for the ruling dispensation at the centre. Part 2 focuses on community’s political options and choices in contemporary India. Part 3 looks at the move towards internal reform and empowerment within the community. Next: Naseeruddin Shah on what it is to be a Muslim in India.)

466,fv7vcei,"Good question. In my own country in Europe, too, the countries with the most foreign offenders relative to the size of the population are mostly Muslim.

1 Algeria

2 Morocco

3 Libya

4 Gambia

5 Nigeria

6 Senegal

7 Tunisia

8 Sierra Leone

9 Georgia

10 Democratic Republic of the Congo

11 Somalia

12 Cameroon

13 Afghanistan

14 Albania

15 Pakistan

&amp;#x200B;

The majority of these offenders are male, young, and presumably Muslim (there are no statistics on religious affiliation, one must simply assume that refugees from Islamic states are mostly Muslims).

But young Muslim women are rarely criminals. Young men tend to be more criminal, regardless of religion, but Muslim men are more criminal than, for example, young men from other backgrounds. Old Muslim men also do not have an above-average crime rate.

Then when you look at the immigrants from East Asia: These extremely rarely commit crimes. Chinese, Koreans, Taiwanese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Philippinos are all much more peaceful than the immigrants from Muslim countries.

The statistical probability of an Algerian immigrant committing a crime is 125 times higher than that of a Chinese immigrant. This is absolutely extreme.

So the toxic combination is male, young, Muslim. Why?"
467,fw94my3,"&gt;Had underage marriage been allowed in Hinduism, would you say the same shit all over again?

No. I would fight for reform in Hinduism if it had been so. Heck, religion be damned. If Indian Law abolishes it, it should criminal for everyone irrespective of religion.

My point is that I am responsible for human rights preservation in my country. I can condemn what happens in other countries but I can't do anything unless you want me to start a insurgent group for this cause.

They are a different country whose state decided establish a regime on religious grounds. If muslim women are being oppressed in their country, it is their state's responsible for idiotic policies that lead to this regression in basic human rights. 

It is different for non-muslims in Pakistan however because even their state doesn't consider them as their own. Hence disallowing them from electorate, etc.

&gt;Quran  indirectly allows the male to beat his wife up, wouldn't the scene of a  muslim guy thrashing his wife make your blood boil?

It would. 

You would still call me a moron if I call for worldwide abolishment of Islam+force reeducation for all muslims because muh muslim oppression so whatever."
468,foss7ax,"&gt;All i am saying is that the official statistics for the UK regarding criminal actions against females do not support your statement from a religious household point-of-view. 

Is it really so hard to believe that a woman raised in a culture that teaches that it's the husband's right and duty to beat her when she steps out of line is less likely to go to the police when he does? I'd guess that a greater proportion of Muslim women are immigrants, too, which means there's a greater chance they don't know how to navigate the system and/or don't want to risk their family being deported. The statistics are unreliable when there's multiple factors that contribute to underreporting."
469,fq9g43b,"&gt;be specific, what is happening? good men in pakistan are unable to control themselves from raping women? completely unable to control themselves? i don't see a flood of women complaining about being raped, so are the men all raping themselves?

It is not a one button switch that is either completely or not. Like depression, it got bouts of uncontrollable urges mixed with period of none to mild ones. The crime is usually committed within the extreme one (if opportunity exists).

Rape is one extremely visible outcome, one that tickles with ego of men in Pakistan. Women not being raped at masses does not mean they are safe. And many minors, guys and other humans are also taking hits instead of them. Still, the situation has not reached as bad as it is in India yet. Why? Because our women are yet to reach the lifestyle of their women. It is only a matter of time till the number rise. I do not wan't to

There are other damaging problems as well.

Like entire thought process of an average student it shifted towards attaining that instead of planning for career, society or life. If you studied Maslow's hierarchy, you would know that a person can not think beyond the need unless it is attained. Expect no progress with education with such minds.

Gender-biasness among workplaces another thing creeped up. You would find many women-favoring jobs under the banner of ""women empowerment"" or ""equal opportunity employer"" but in reality there is some thirsty bunch of people sitting above victimized by similar need. Forget merit among workplaces if such things would linger.

This is why diffusing the urge among masses is more important for me than pointing out someone's big mistake (if it is an actual mistake and not done for fun) and saying ""Latkado isko"" like people of zamana-e-jahliyat only because it sooths my ego and makes me appear manly.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  for what purpose? 

To know that how they lived and controlled, and for how long.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; yes, millions of unmarried muslim women are doing nothing at all with their lives but making tiktok videos that you don't watch instead of marrying you. 

There are two problems with this, one is lack of responsible generation of women (even generations since many mothers are like that as well), second lack of modesty. There is a reason hoeing around is condemned, social media or not. Advertising your body to gain mass following and perks would always add more evils in society. She may escape, but an innocent women someone around can be the victim because of her actions over the years.

&gt; i sincerely hope you never breed and especially never have daughters. 

If I ever did that, I will raise socially-aware and responsible daughters.  Not spoiled ones.

&gt;Hey hey HEY **HEY** how come you never say a word about female needs? men can't control themselves when they don't have sex ever or for a long time but women have no trouble in this area? 

Actually I used to think that women may go through similar problems, but they do not. First, they are not deprived of that. They are in control of that. Second, read the link I shared in posts above. While this is men's primitive desire, women's primitive desire is more of social/security in nature. This is why you would find their urges within that social media hoeing, or torn clothes to gain attention instead of sexual ones. If you are ridiculing men's urges, don't forget to do theirs as well. 

It is not about me. Incel is someone who thinks he's entitled for this, rapist is someone who can not control his desires overtime regardless of entitlement sense (not including those who do it for fun, they are criminals).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; oh, and what reflects that? looking into their hearts? and you've done that? 

No, change of behaviors. If you can not sense that in society, I can not point you anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; your opinions (what's your background again?) vs actual studies conducted over decades and in multiple countries. which one could be more trustworthy? 

Share few researches over decades and country which link testosterone with urges. For now lets just say that I am an ordinary human being who studied these things extensively to find the problems within myself and within society (after facing similar problems).

 

&gt;you are wrong here, too. example: the el salvadore civil war ran for over a decade. do yourself a favour and google about rapes during the war, and what eventually stopped it. it certainly wasn't men getting married or having unrape-y sex!  
&gt;  
&gt;same with several wars in various african countries, central america, other places.

You want our generations to live like they're in state of war under an oppresed warload? And you think its sustainable?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; come up with something other than tired lazy bs opinions for once. **where's your evidence?** 

What kind of evidence do you want? I have told you the exact problems and how various societies approached it vs how we are trying to wipe it down under the carpet because we picked up odd blends of cultures."
470,fedew1a,"It should be noted that I don't mean to generalize, majority of Pakistani men are not a product of this framework. As someone from Pakistan, in my opinion, the cultural aspect plays a much bigger role compared to the socioeconomic causes, although admittedly I don't have a lot of insight into the socioeconomic conditions of Pakistani community in UK. Pakistani culture is hostile towards women and treats them as a commodity, and the religion further enables that. So, non-muslim women are not only seen as a commodity by virture of the culture but also not part of the tribe on account of being non-muslim. Its absurd and deeply frustrating that these criminals go unpunished."
471,fgv2xnc,"You know what grinds my gears? I'm not a Muslim, but the voices of Muslim women are heavily marginalized here in the West. A lot of the time the only things people hear about Islam come from such illustrious scholars as Sam Harris and Bill Maher who tell dumbass stories about Islam where the message is ""they're a scary brown people religion and they hate women."" None of these assholes ever talk to Muslim women about their lives, and the media virtually never lets the voices of Muslim women into the public discourse. 

And on those rare occasions when Muslim women get to tell their point of view in the West, you get all kinds of asshole journalists and political consultants who make hijab-wearers defend Saudi Arabia and say stuff like ""that doesn't seem very feminist does it?"" The fucking Saudi royal family fucks everything up for Muslims worldwide by making Islam look bad. They're a bunch of crooked war criminals who starve Yemeni babies to death and then use their blood money to spread *ISLAMOPHOBIC* attacks against Ilhan Omar because she's calls them on their shit. 

I assume that the Quran probably has some verses about watching out for leaders who act all pious in public for the press but only worship the Almighty Petro-dollar in private. I wonder what kinds of leader that's supposed to refer to..."
472,fb909po,"Most of them came to stay, and If they want to build up a future that isn't centered around gouvernement aides or criminal activity it's a necessesity to know the language of the host country.

Muslim women are a special case though because in a lot of cases their husband earns the money while they stay at home to raise the kids so unless they want to engage in social activity, outside of the arab community in wich they live in alot of cases, they really don't ""need"" to learn the language."
473,fbjvqay,"&gt;Nour Farhat dreams of one day becoming a criminal prosecutor – a dream that’s now on hold. Baraa Arar, an aspiring academic, decided to pursue a master’s degree in Toronto instead of Montreal because she no longer sees a future for herself in the province where she was born. Ichrak Nourel Hak, who is studying to be a teacher, now finds the path to her chosen career blocked.

&gt;These three women are just a few of the Quebeckers struggling with the implications of the province’s religious symbols law (formerly Bill 21). Passed in June, 2019, the law prohibits public-services workers, including teachers, Crown prosecutors, judges and police officers, from wearing religious garments on the job. The law has derailed the lives and careers of thousands of Muslim women who wear the hijab or niqab, Sikh men who wear a turban, orthodox Jews who wear a kippa, and others. It has also killed hopes of advancement for employees who’ve been grandfathered into their current public-service jobs but whose chances for promotion are now limited.

&gt;Several challenges to the bill have been launched, but on Dec. 12, the Quebec Court of Appeal rejected a request to suspend the ban until a final court ruling – despite the three-judge panel agreeing the law risks causing irreparable harm to some Quebeckers.

&gt;Muslim women are disproportionately affected by the law, and The Globe and Mail connected with six of them to talk about how it has disrupted their careers and education, damaged their mental health and left them wondering whether they are still welcome in Quebec. “I used to see myself as a complete Québécoise and presented myself as such when travelling abroad,"" Ms. Farhat says.

475,fci3p5w,"&gt; Ahh you switched to a completely different topic because the Muslim women are oppressed and the West turns a fucking blind eye to them.

Oh please, as if you or anyone else seriously cares about the plight of Muslims unless it serves a political agenda. I am watching Muslims being killed around the world at a rate higher than any other religious demographic and you are going to try that argument? Puhleeze. I'm a Muslim and I am not convinced whatsoever about your authenticity here Mr. ""Muslims are ruining European culture"" guy.

&gt; Muslim women regularly vote for the bjp.

Cite your sources. My cousin did not vote for the BJP nor does anyone she know. She is of the demographic you are pretending to be speaking for at the moment. [The evidence at the vote bank does not support your claim. A vast majority of Hindu voters outvoting a smaller Muslim population just makes your claim seem somewhat possible but does not jive with reality.](https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/lok-sabha-election-muslim-votebank-bjp-congress-1535453-2019-05-27)

&gt; They criminalized triple talaq last year which was the archaic practice of a muslims man instantly divorcing his wife by saying talaq thrice.

&gt; What's the answer to this.

Good. It was an archaic and patriarchal practice that eroded the rights of women. In Islam, women are allowed the same rights to divorce but men always conveniently leave those rules hidden. A wife can divorce her husband as well, but unfortunately many backwards Muslims don't recognize that right.

What? You thought I was going to cry about triple talaaq being banned? Unlike you, I actually don't need to twist myself into a pretzel to make my argument. I just stand up for the morally correct thing and let that be enough. I am not a sycophant to any group... unlike you it seems.

Lets get back to it my fellow ""doctor"" who is concerned about Europe's culture:

&gt; You are saving women from being oppressed by a backwards outdated practice by advocating for the oppression of Muslims in India and in Europe? I don't follow. 

&gt; You are here in this thread talking about [""muslims starting to wipe out"" European culture](https://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/eh6cje/final_solution_2004_how_indian_prime_minister/fcg5l2e/) (a classic genocidal and xenophobic argument) by advocating for the suffering of those Muslim women as well? How noble of you (/s).

&gt; Please explain how Muslims are ""wiping out"" European culture. Please do your best to not sound like a xenophobic, bigoted, and pro-genocidal person while you do it. I know it will be hard but I am sure you can try to achieve some mental gymnastic levels above 9000 to (try and) succeed in this endeavor.

Go, lets hear it. I didn't break a sweat with your silly argument. I want to see you work for those downvotes. Comon beta, chalo. Lets see how far you will dig. Maybe you can reach the center of the earth!"
476,fdkmgbn,"&gt;most of those criminals who are killed are killed as part of property or non-violent drug crime

Drinking, possession of alcoholic beverages and drugs, un-Islamic dress, as well as public displays of affection with a member of the opposite sex are considered to be crimes. Relations between non-Muslim men and Muslim women are illegal. **Adultery, sex outside marriage, and consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Iran and carry the death penalty.**

Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Iran are severe and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. **Iran executes many people each year on drug-related charges.**

477,f47zul8,"&gt; Oh je ne remet pas en cause la citation du jugement Européen, hautement  pertinent. À mon sens l,argument de la discrimination basée sur le sexe  est absurde; seront tout autant visé les hommes juifs pour la kippa et  les hommes sikh pour le turban. L'argument ne tient tout simplement pas  la route. Perso, je n'ai entendu personne essayer l'argument de la  discrimination basée sur le sexe. 

Cet argument a été avancé comme voie pour renverser la loi 21 dans certains articles de la presse anglophone.

Par exemple: [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/as-fight-over-quebec-s-religious-symbols-law-shifts-to-courts-legal-experts-debate-best-way-to-challenge-it-1.5204112](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/as-fight-over-quebec-s-religious-symbols-law-shifts-to-courts-legal-experts-debate-best-way-to-challenge-it-1.5204112)

*Section 28 and gender equality*

*Then there is the option of turning to those sections of the Charter that aren't subject to the notwithstanding clause.*

*That's  the case for Section 28, which states the rights laid out elsewhere in  the Charter must be provided equally to men and women.*

*Several  groups in Quebec have repeatedly warned the government that while Bill  21 doesn't single out a particular religion, Muslim women are likely to  be more affected than others.*  

*Not only is the hijab an easily  identifiable religious symbol, they say, but teaching is a popular  career choice for many Muslim women in Quebec.*

*If a gender imbalance could be proven, judges might feel compelled to strike down the law because of Section 28.*

&gt; Par contre, comme je le dit, le même jugement conclut aussi qu'il y a  discrimination quant à la liberté de religion, mais conclue à la  raisonnabilité de cette discrimination. 

Je crois que ton usage du terme ""discrimination"" ici est incorrect. Discrimination n'implique pas une limite raisonnable à un droit, mais un traitement différent basé sur la religion. C'est différent.

&gt; Ouin, sauf que la charte québécoise prédate la charte de Trudeau (75 QC  vs 82 CAN) et prévoit elle aussi ce droit. L'argument est boiteux à  souhait. Le parlement est bien sûr loisible d'amender la charte  québécoise s'il croit que c'est nécessaire. Le concept de loi  constitutionnel est très ancien, et une démocratie sans contrôle  judiciaire ça a essentiellement jamais existé. 

En fait, c'est le principe de revue judiciaire des lois qui est un développement plutôt récent. Au Royaume-Uni, jusqu'à l'application de la Charte Européenne des Droits, la revue judiciaire des lois parlementaires était impossible, car chaque Acte du Parlement est considéré comme étant un Acte Constitutionnel. L'Australie n'a pas de Charte de droits constitutionnelle. La Nouvelle-Zélande a une charte des droits qui est une loi et non une partie de sa Constitution... comme l'ancienne charte des droits avant 1982. La Hollande n'a explicitement pas de revue judiciaire. La revue judiciaire des lois en France est faite par le Conseil Constitutionnel dont les membres ont des mandats de seulement 9 ans et sont nommés par le Sénat, l'Assemblée et le Président, ce qui fait en sorte que le Conseil est très dépendant du gouvernement. Charles De Gaulle a d'ailleurs déjà dit ""[En France, la Cour Suprême, c'est le Peuple](https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/les-membres/le-metier-de-juge-constitutionnel)"".

Surtout, il faut faire une différence entre les vieilles constitutions qui avaient des articles clairs et précis comme le droit de vote et autres, et le [nouveau constitutionnalisme](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20434076?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) qui met des articles vagues sur les droits et laisse les tribunaux décider ce qu'ils veulent dire.

&gt;Juste... non. C'est pas ça du tout.  
&gt;  
&gt;C'est  effectivement très facile pour une loi de limiter ou discriminer en  fonction de la religion. Limiter l'habillement/singe religieux en est  une à coup sûr, et ce fut confirmée à multiple reprise par les tribunaux  (kirpan à l'école, casque de sécurité pour les sikh, etc.), mais il y a  une clause qui permet la discrimination/de limiter la liberté, et c'est  essentiellement ""raisonnable et se justifie dans une société libre et  démocratique.""

Tu dis que c'est pas ça, mais tu ne sembles pas dire quoi que ce soit qui contredit ce que j'ai dit.

Quand il y a une limite raisonnable à l'exercice d'un droit, on ne parle pas habituellement de ces limites comme violant ces droits. Par exemple, personne ne dit que la loi criminalisant la propagande haineuse viole la liberté d'expression, on dit qu'elle représente une limite raisonnable à cette liberté et donc qu'elle est compatible avec la liberté d'expression. Si on cède dès le début à ceux qui disent que la loi 21 viole la liberté de religion, que tu le veuilles ou non, ça véhicule un message que la limite à la liberté de religion contenue dans la loi 21 n'est pas raisonnable ou justifiée."

&gt;While American Muslims, especially Sunnis, do not have institutional rigidity similar to the Catholic Church — our institutions, especially as they grow, become central in young Muslims’ connections to their faith. **And our institutions are more and more built on cults of personality — which leave faith reliant on man, by design, versus on its own legs. So when personalities abuse and fall, institutions begin to fall and we begin to see our own detach themselves from centers that should be there to create a community space and a spiritual haven.**

I found this part to be very interesting

and this part about the muslim identity in the west and how many people are unable to accept that sort of muslim identity 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In recent years, there has been a growing reactionary conversation around how so many young American Muslim women are leaving an Orthodox Islam (a poor term that will make any academic reading this cringe) for an Islam that, they will argue, looks less and less like Islam but still calls itself. It’s the Islam of Feminism; the Islam of modernity. The Islam of Liberalism. They’re accused of simply spreading fitna and being ignorant of the faith. **And yes, a part of it is the result of living in a liberal modern state which has made ‘Muslim’ into a racial category that we, ourselves, have adopted without challenge and so theology and fiqh become secondary to what it means to be existing in a body that’s been criminalized.**"

Moreover, the news will also refuse to make the connection between police needing to act better than any criminal. But, CNN has no problem letting extremists spew their propaganda without any pushback. She even said Muslim women are crucified and stoned for not wearing the hijab, which is not something any of the 50 or so Muslim majority countries' governments do."

Muslim men can no longer divorce wives by saying 'talaq' three times in India    
Lucy Middleton Wednesday 31 Jul 2019 12:49 pm_


Women in India have been celebrating today after a law was introduced against the Muslim practice of ‘instant divorce’.

‘Triple Talaq’, as it is known, allows a man to instantly divorce his wife by repeating the word ‘talaq’ three times in succession.

The word means ‘you are divorced’ in Arabic and can be presented in any form, including in an email or text message.

India’s parliament has now made using the controversial practice a criminal offence, punishable by up to three years in prison.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi managed to push through the bill despite stiff resistance from opposing parties, tweeting afterwards: ‘An archaic and medieval practice has finally been confined to the dustbin of history. Parliament abolishes Triple Talaq and corrects a historical wrong done to Muslim women. This is a victory of gender justice and will further equality in society. India rejoices today!’

The practice was first declared unconstitutional by The Supreme Court in 2017 after several Muslim women petitioned against it.

They argued that the unilateral power of Muslim men to end marriages violated India’s constitution by infringing on their fundamental right to equality.

Some of them had been divorced by letters or through messaging apps like WhatsApp, leaving them without any legal remedy.

Shayara Bano, 38, who started the petition after being ‘instantly divorced’ by her husband, said the move would ensure Muslim women are ‘treated as equals in society and in the eyes of law’.

She told the Economic Times: ‘I hope the government and society would now help rehabilitate victims like me.’

Modi had first attempted to outlaw the practice during his first term in office, but did not have enough upper house support to pass it through until after his victory in the recent May elections.

The law will come into effect after receiving a formal nod from the president in next few days.

**Besides a jail term and a fine, it will also require Muslim men to financially support their wives, who will also get custody of their children.**

India has no uniform civil law for marriage, divorce and property.

Its constitution allows followers of each faith to use their religious laws to govern such matters, including 180 million Muslims, the largest religious minority in the Hindu-dominated country

Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has long pushed for a uniform civil code to be enforced in India."
482,es0jpru,"Like I said elsewhere, the French government is just adding oil to the fire with such repressive policy, turning it into a game of cat and mouse where the worst conservative Muslim cultures are posturing as liberation of women.

It's between a repressive institution and another, but with women serving in between as the scapegoats. Having a no-fabric policy on the beach or at the pool for *everyone* would solve the matter.

&gt; And how exactly do you fix that by criminalising the women you are supposedly protecting?

The exact same could be said of why Sunni Muslim women are wearing the burqa in the first place..."
483,es2w4mi,"I don't understand how people can't see it. He gave scholarship to Muslims and 50 freaking percent of them is reserved for muslim women. 50% reservation for women isn't there for any scholarships for women in India. Don't you see if Muslim women are liberated islam will lose. There is going to be free coaching for muslims women for civil services etc.  He is going criminalize triple talaq. He is trying to get Muslim women votes and also try to show the country he is working for muslims while working for their women mostly. 

There was an announcement that schools, hospitals will be built on waqf land. Will hospitals be exclusive for Muslims? He is trying to make use of waqf land which benefits all and isn't used for making jihadi University."
484,enmugza,"Can we make an organized push to make these people's sexuality-policing rhetoric as unacceptable and broadly shamed as incels?  Y'know, since it IS as unacceptable?  Please?

Seriously this is ridiculous

&gt;Fatphobia

I won't date fat women because it is a literal, physical impossibility for me to be intimate with them.  I actually let the seriously broad societal brainwashing poison me into trying to ""choose"" to be okay with obesity in one woman's case and it led to one of the worst dating experiences of my life.  Ugh.

&gt;Anti blackness / racism

Not actually sure why these are listed separately but okay.

I actually have always been quite attracted to black women and most lady POC. I'm sure this person would construe my lack of attraction to *fat* POC as racism, but I'm gonna throw that aside.  Love dark skin, love a lot of qualities you'll only find in these ladies.

But you know what?  Some people aren't.  And that's okay, as long as it's not based on antiquated hoodrat stereotypes etc.  Some research suggests that people are wired in to be drawn to people with similar genetics; nothing is remotely unbelievable about people having a physical lack of attraction to certain races.  It's fine.  If you want to divine their character, ask them some softball questions to see if they harbor *actual* toxic prejudices.

&gt;Xenophobia

Covered above, clearly just furiously pounding buzzwords in one after the other. 

&gt;Transphobia

HELL NO.  Fuck off.

I'm not opening the Ben Shapiro Bullshit Hour can of worms, this is not an argument about whether trans women are women etc.

Trans women are women.  They are also, nonetheless, *TRANS* women.  It is different. You can dislike that all you want; you're wrong.  To argue that there is no perceptible difference between someone born and raised female versus someone who had male hormones pumping through their body for their entire life up to a certain point where they figured themselves out, usually after about two decades, is full stop delusion.

There are often visible differences in bone structure.  There are often variances in ""passing"".  It's unknown how many actually get reassignment surgery, and the fact that I have to justify that I'm not a transphobe because I don't want to have sex with people who have dicks is fucking ridiculous.  Oh right, and trans women can't have children.  And this says nothing of FtM - unless there have been huge advances in science I'm not aware of, FtM men don't have man plumbing and that's gonna be *slightly* a problem for straight women.

So god damn ridiculous.  And transphobia absolutely is a real problem - absolutely.  It makes a mockery of the issue when these people try to force Kinsey-approved Hard Straight people to accept their ingrained preferences as bigotry because anyone with a rational mind looking in from the outside is going to see how completely ridiculous that is, and subconsciously remember this next time they see mention of the word 'transphobia', which might be something more severe.  

This goes for almost all -isms and -phobias too and I wish these people could pull their heads out of their asses long enough to understand that.  But hell.  Maybe they're perfectly aware.  Do they actually care about anything right or just, or just shaming people into behaving the way they want them to with whatever convenient buzzword ammunition is available?

&gt;Misogynoir

hahahahahhahahahhahahaha.  what.

If this person is gonna call it misogyny that I expect a partner that can take care of themselves - in all facets of life - they should consult my barely not UNDERweight ex who was as bad at managing her finances and priorities as fat women are at managing their calories.  Either way, it's indicative of an aspect of adulting they aren't good at and I don't want it in my life, and also it gives me soft sausage which is *kind of an issue*.  Christ.

&gt;Addiction stigma

...?  What?  I'm never dating an alcoholic again.  I'm never dating a substance abuser again period.

These people don't think food addiction is real so what the fuck are they getting at, are they really going to say you can't filter someone out for the choice of being a substance abuser?  What the actual fuck?  This isn't supposed to be something they actually say.  It's supposed to be the exaggeration we use for comparison's sake.  Now they're just .. saying it unironically, so that's lovely.

&gt;Sex worker stigma

Yeah, who wouldn't want a tremendously increased chance of catching an STI!  And a higher chance of hard drugs ending up in your social circle or life?  And a higher chance of being involved in criminal activity or dealing with criminals?  Pimps are wonderful guys, super chill.

This is bullshit nonsense and I'm not responding to it further.

&gt;anti native

I'm not - although according to this person I'm sure I am, as the obesity prevalence is not flattering and thus makes it very unlikely for me

&gt;anti dalit

I genuinely don't know what dalit are

&gt;Classism

I'm not dating a girl I have to support financially, beyond that I don't care.  But lol, like rich people don't use classism as their FIRST filter, come on.

&gt;Ableism

Being fat isn't a disability - until it is, and if it reaches that point you chose disability.

And no, I likely won't date a woman in a wheelchair.  I want to introduce healthy activities that revolve around adventure and exercise when I get to a lower weight, and that's not going to be possible with someone incapable.  Be mad.  

&gt;Islamophobia

Haha where the fuck did this come from

Okay so there's a slight problem called Sharia Law which no, not ALL muslim folks practice or support, but many do.  It's got a lot of really wonderful actual bigotry codified within it, including literally medieval ways of treating women that are defiled.  I have no idea what the prevalence of hard Sharia Law compliance is within the broader muslim community, but its sentiments do influence aspects of the culture and that's why beatings and honor killings are a thing you've heard of not *very* often, yet often enough to be concerning.

Don't @ me I studied Islamic history for untold hours in college and this person doesn't know a fucking a thing about it other than that islamophobia is a useful buzzword to end arguments.

Now with *that* said?  I think Arabian girls are often very beautiful.  However, I'm not going to convert to Islam - or *any* religion - for any woman and that would often be a requirement.  I'm also not going to wait until marriage to be intimate with a woman, and that would also often be a requirement.  I'm *also* not going to risk family tension (or worse) for an SO through being the reason that she breaks cultural expectations regardless of whether I agree with them.  All of these things would be an obstacle for *most* to at least some degree.

But if I met some girl from an obviously moderate family, sure, I'd be into it. I just haven't yet.

...this has gotten very off topic though.  Because man, muslim women are one of the few demographics doing well with this whole obesity crisis thing from what I've seen."
485,ekgdj1c,"&gt;... But that is what happened and is happening? 

That isn't completely true, most of the time the Muslim states that experience extremism and fundamentalism are exactly the states that have been supported and/or influenced by the West. Just look at Saudi Arabia (best buddies with the U.S. yet one of the most extremist country as of yet), Afghanistan (Taliban being supported, initially by the U.S. and constantly by the Saudis and Pakistanis), al-Qaeda (CIA much?), ISIS/Daesh (literally a part of their generals are Saudis, they have American weapons and vehicles and often enjoy suppression fire from the American side against the Syrians), ... 

The majority of Islamic history is characteristic through it's solidarity, acceptance, focus on arts and sciences, stability, ...

&gt;I'm saying I think what people dislike about western women wearing the hijab is that you are telling the millions of women still at risk of torture and death for wearing it to to fuck themselves. That you can still br controlled and oppressed simply by being brainwashed.  

And what about the millions of women who are at risk of being beaten down, discriminated, raped, killed, ... because they were a hijab? Should they just fuck themselves and be oppressed because you ***think*** that the hijab stands for oppression? 

&gt;Died implies they are done dying. They are not. 

Same thing for women who want to wear a hijab and practice their religion. I feel like you really don't know anything about the Muslim population in general ... have you never seen the situation in Myanmar, North China, Russia, ... ? How Muslims are being put in 're-education camps' in China, how Muslim women are being raped and men are being killed in Myanmar, how being Muslim is being criminalized? 

&gt;You honor or respect them by wearing what they have to in a country thay will freely allow you not to? 

How do you honor the women that are being targeted simply for wearing a hijab? By still not wearing a hijab, and thus giving in to those violent lunatics?

&gt;I'm not gonna start the topic of Islam and it's books meaning. 

Then don't start taking your assumptions about Islam and it's books as facts if you can't back it up. 

&gt;It isn't mean to cover the mens face so that women that can't help themselves won't drag them out back and rape them. I will also say that one evil being overlooked doesn't mean another can't be focused on. 

Neither is the hijab meant to cover women's faces ... you're confusing the Burqa (a Saudi interpretation of the hijab influence by their culture). You're discussing something while not even knowing what the topic is ...? For real? And if this is such an important issue, why are the leaders of the ""free world"" still going to the Saudi royal family and kissing their hands and feet for that sweet, sweet oil? The West are the ones who helped the Saudis to power and they are the ones keeping them in power. 

&gt;Pointing out history and ongoing mass oppression still occuring in many muslim areas doesn't say shit about what I think of women. I think women in America have the freedom to choose how they dress. I simply believe, rather strongly, that ""choosing"" to wear a symbol of hatred and oppression towards women makes you an idiot. 

Now it's oppression *and* hatred. First of all, in the majority of the Muslim countries, the hijab isn't mandatory. Let's take that out of the way. Secondly, history shows us that most of the Muslim countries where this oppression is happening are nations supported/influenced by the West (especially the U.S.) or nations supported by Saudi Arabia. 

Do you see where I'm going with this. History is proving you wrong, even the present situation shows how wrong you are. The hijab isn't a symbol of hatred and oppression simply because you ***think*** it is without even talking to Muslim women about it and how they feel about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

You're lacking in knowledge, read up about the hijab first, since you don't even know what a hijab is, and about the reason why politicians and activists wear a hijab in protest. Then return to this debate."
486,ei6fujl,"&gt; Iran isn’t a shithole. It’s a cosmopolitan nation of highly educated men and women.

Oh really?  From https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/iran/local-laws-and-customs 

&gt; Iran is a Muslim country in which Islamic law is strictly enforced. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas. **It is forbidden to eat, drink or smoke in public during daylight hours during the month of Ramadan.**

&gt; In 2019, the holy month of Ramadan is expected to start on 6 May and finish on 5 June. See Travelling during Ramadan

&gt; Islamic codes of behaviour and dress are strictly enforced. **In any public place women must cover their heads with a headscarf**, wear trousers (or a floor length skirt), and a long-sleeved tunic or coat that reaches to mid-thigh or knee. Men should wear long trousers and long-sleeve shirts.

&gt; There are additional dress requirements at certain religious sites. Women may be asked to put on a chador (a garment that covers the whole body except the face) before entering.

&gt; **Relationships between non-Muslim men and Muslim women are illegal**, although few Westerners have been prosecuted. If a Muslim woman is found in a relationship with a non-Muslim man, **she may be sentenced to be whipped**.

&gt; Women should take extra care, particularly when travelling alone or with friends of the opposite sex. If you’re a woman travelling in Iran you should respect local dress codes and customs and avoid isolated areas. See these travel tips for women travellers.

&gt; Unmarried partners and friends of the opposite sex travelling together should be discreet at all times in public. Iranian hotel managers could insist on seeing a marriage certificate before allowing any couple to share a double hotel room.

&gt; Homosexual behaviour, adultery and sex outside of marriage are illegal under Iranian law **and can carry the death penalty**. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.

&gt; Women’s magazines and DVDs or videos depicting sexual relations are forbidden. There are occasional clampdowns. Satellite dishes and many Western CDs and films remain illegal.

&gt; The import, sale, manufacture and consumption of alcohol in Iran is strictly forbidden on religious grounds, with exceptions only for certain recognised Iranian religious minorities (not foreigners). **Penalties can be severe.**

&gt; Photography near military and other government installations is strictly prohibited. Sensitive government buildings and facilities are often difficult to identify. Take extreme care when taking photographs in any areas that are anything other than very obvious tourist attractions.

**Using a laptop or other electronic equipment in public places can be misinterpreted**, especially if it contains photographs. You may be arrested and detained on serious criminal charges, including espionage. It’s better to ask before taking photographs of people.

&gt; Penalties for importing and possessing drugs are severe and enforced. **Many individuals convicted of drug offences, including foreign nationals, have been executed.**

&gt; Importing pork products isn’t allowed.

&gt; The Iranian legal system differs in many ways from the UK.** Suspects can be held without charge and aren’t always allowed quick access to legal representation.** In the past, consular access has been very limited. The Iranian authorities don’t grant consular access to dual-nationals.

&gt; In some cases, we believe that individuals involved in commercial disputes with Iranian companies or individuals have been prevented from leaving the country pending resolution of the dispute.

&gt; As a representative of a British or western company, you may be subject to particular attention. British business people travelling to Iran should take appropriate steps to protect commercially sensitive information (including password protection of electronic devices (minimum 4 digits) and not taking unnecessary information with you). Electronic devices may be screened by customs officials on arrival and departure.

&gt; You should carry a photocopy of your passport for identification. Make sure you have included emergency contact details.


**In other words, it's a shithole.**  

&gt; You point to a majority Muslim country you think is a shithole, and I’ll show you how the West contributed to that.

Ahh yes, blame the West for Muslims being Muslim.  With these two assertions you've officially argued yourself beyond rationality.  I'm done.

487,ejmmxgi,"Let me say that my first post to you was overly harsh and I've enjoyed the rest our discussion. Yes, it's a men's space that's very raw. But imo women can thank themselves for a lot of what you call ""sexism."" In r/XXchromosomes (or the feminist subreddit of your choice) there's alot of good old fashioned man-hating and no one bats an eye. Why is it suddenly a problem when the ire is turned back on women, are they above critique? I think what a lot of men these days are really tired of all the double standards that benefit women in our society and they are starting to lose their filter. Why are Western men taken to task for sexism when islamic men are not?  Why does the criminal justice system and divorce courts favor women in sentencing and things like alimony and custody.  These topics have been debated endlessly with both sides refusing to budge.  The result: Men are fed up with these double standards and inequality of outcomes so they are choosing not to buy in at all.  I do agree with you that everyone should choose their own pathway and am happy for you that being in a relationship works for you. "

&gt;This is racist as it is implying that it is the fault of the black community, that they have been facing systematic and institutionalized discrimination. And it is implying that black people somehow ""teach this"" to their children.

Again, just a fucking hypocrite dude.

&gt;Ever heard of religious fundamentalists?

So why isn't this video targeting christians and muslims? Why is it targeting men. Do you think Islamic women are chill with their son having a gay friend? Why is it targeting men? Please, tell me. If you see a bunch of gang members beating a guy senseless, do you phone the police and report a bunch of &gt;humans&lt; doing the naughty, or do you report a bunch of gang members doing something and maybe throw in descriptions, like they're all wearing red and they're all black and all look like they're 20-ish.

Nah that doesn't make sense, right? Makes way more sense to describe the perpetrators as &gt;living organism&lt; 

Do you even understand why generalising is bad? Do you even understand what a generalisation is?

&gt; Of course its they don't teach them your dumb strawman

Oh but they do teach them your strawman? Again - why isn't this ad targeting for instance fundamentalist Islamic men. These are the exact type of people that would do all of the following:

- Be ok with beating gays
- Be ok with bullying gays
- Be ok with following women
- Be ok with demanding women smile
- Be ok with patronising female co-workers

I think the only one they wouldn't be ok with is watching two kids fight, because again - this doesn't fucking happen. WHO THE HELL has ever seen two kids fighting while a bunch of adults or even just one adult watches, like fucking dog fighting. It is absurdddddddd.

&gt;but a hatred of gay people is instilled in a lot of children still, and statements such as: ""I don't believe it's right but I'll not interfere"" and such are still prevalent homophovix remarks.

By &gt;men&lt;? Or by specific groups - like homophobes, fundamentalist christians, islamists, far right wingers and so on. Why is this ad directed at men? You can't fucking answer that question.

If this ad was about crime and it chose to focus entirely on black men, you would be losing your mind right now and rightly so - because it would be racist as fuck, not to mention unnecessary. It is not the place of a child labouring billion dollar corporation to lecture and generalise protected classes on how to handle themselves. Thats without even bringing in the fact that almost all of their generalisations do not apply at all.

It is not men patronising their female co-workers. It is an extreme minority of high ranking executives.

It is not men promoting their children go out and hunt down gay people. It is an extreme minority of fundamentalist christians, Islamist and far right wing extremists.

It is not men following women down the street harassing them. It is creepy sexual harassers, likely with a criminal record.

It is not men promoting that their children get into the back yard and fight each other. In fact, it is no one. I don't believe this shit actually happens, outside of shit like dojos or boxing rings, where people are training to become boxers.

If you still don't get why this ad is shit after this, then there is no hope for you. 

Go ahead continue promoting a child labouring sexist mega corporation that uses your bias to spread its influence. 

Useful idiot."
489,ebdmqqc,"-The reason Atheists have a bad reputation among other communities is because a few idiots think that not believing in a religion allows you to insult them. Anyways, if you are correct, you just die and nothing happens. If there IS a God and we're correct, then oh boy you're in for a ride.
-Literally not a single girl I'm related to wears a hijab even though they're religious because they don't want to. Doesn't mean they're any less of muslims. It's forbidden to force it on someone.
- What kind of islamic world have you visited? Unless it were every single country in the Middle-East, please don't give a half-formed opinion on a subject. Religious states in general are literally the worst considering they  twist a religion to support whatever law they want to pass, and the others accept it. We hate them mainly because people think we're all like them, which you're demonstrating here
-Get this through your head: Not all muslim women are oppressed and some can convert to another religion without consequence, yet stay in the religion. Don't act like you're defending them after berating their way of living. Actions of a few don't speak for many, because if they DO, then Atheists would be the scum of the Earth which they obviously are NOT (I also have atheist friends, just throwing that out there). 
-One example of how they ""don't need your protection"" is G. Willow Wilson. Google her and see how she willingly converted.
-Hating Islam is less justified than hating muslims because it's human free will and personal ideologies that apply coats of corruption over a belief.
-Everything we have done was done by another religion before, hyet for some reason we're the only ones who get coverage because according to studies, a muslim criminal is 300% more likely to make it on the media. If you complain that religion ""brainwashes"" then don't come at me citing Fox News.
-Jesus Christ's mother covered herself, yet only muslims are known for that. I wonder why that is...
-Concerning the ""extra rights"", may I know why wearing something supposed to make you less attractive (which is basically an untold requirement for fair politics) that don't really help in any way other than to ward off someone creepy can equate to less rights for you? Go to congress and pitch to them your idea to wear a Frying Pan and we'll see who's taken more seriously.
-To conclude, I'm not particularly religious either and consider myself liberal, and while I understand that some people don't want to follow faith  based on proofs they don't believe, insulting them sets back your goal. If you're worried religion ""brainwashes"" while you're here insulting those said religions, people are going to do the opposite of what you say. I've literally heard people say they believe in God to spite Atheists of all things because they dislike how they're starting to force their ideologies more than actual religions now. What you started against basically became you.
-And lastly, a religious community is celebrated because they have something to be thankful for with a culture running on a close line near it, which I understand you're not necessarily a part of. Instead of complaining about how you don't have an equivalent, how about you make yourself a bit more likeable to people in general?"
490,e63mbsd,"Immigration for thousands of years from a shared European culture, same religion etc. I assume you're talking about the Anglo Saxons or some other group who invaded in 300 AD, a lot has changed and developed since then, we have had 2000 years for the Welsh, English and Scottish to intermingle and develop a distinct British culture and it wasn't a bloodless affair.

Our tradition of democracy began around 300 years ago and people who come from Middle-Eastern countries with no concept of democracy, like Afghanistan for example do not value it at all.

We have never had immigration in these numbers from outside Europe before, it only began in the 1950s and is largely untested, the different groups of this country live seperately and segregated, some wards in London and other cities contain 50-70% Muslim despite the national population of Muslims being 5%, Rotherham and the rape gangs is just one example of the problems we have.

Not all cultures are equal, half of all British Muslims think homosexuality should be illegal, if you're gay it's hard to reconcile with that and I'm sure many gay people worry about what will happen if Islam spreads in the UK and becomes the majority religion.

40% of British Muslims want Sharia Law in the UK, we already have Sharia Courts where Muslim women are often coerced to go back to abusive partners, we're in danger of having a seperate legal system in this country.

Not all culture's are equal, Pakistanis make up 2% of the UK population but account for 30% of genetic birth defects which can be horrific, because many marry their cousins and have kids with them.

Muslims make up 5% of the population and 15% of prisoners, so we are literally importing criminality.

Onto the religion, Mohammed and Jesus were very different people, Mo for example was a warlord who beheaded, enslaved and killed many people, Jesus was a celibate who practiced non-violent protest, preached love your neighbour etc. Christianity went through a reformation to put a slightly softer touch on the religion, Islam has not and shows no signs of doing so.

Hopefully you can tell me why this is bullshit, because I would love to know things are actually better than I think they are."
491,e65kh1a,"Some of the posts there are aggravating, though. There's a few posts there by believing Muslimahs, and they manage to trot out a lot of the usual myths and mental gymnastics.

""Islam gave women rights, like the right of divorce, owning property, etc."", ""Islam treated women better than Christianity and Judaism"" and so forth. And as usual, these things are spouted by people who don't even know the first thing about the position of women in Christianity and Judaism _today_ - let alone in Late Antiquity or the Middle Ages.

Case in point: the inheritance law argument. ""Christianity never gave women the right to inherit, therefore Islam is beter for women than Christianity"". This blatantly ignores the fact that _there is no such thing as Christian inheritance law_, so the two religions aren't even comparable in this regard.

I mean, there really is a system of Christian religious law - canon law - but this basically just covers what you're (not) supposed to do in church. Anything that'd fall under what we'd call criminal law (""what should we do with the thief we caught?"") or civil law (ownership disputes, divorce, and, you guessed it; inheritance) is not a religious matter at all in Christianity. And throughout history, Christian communities handled such matters according to whatever secular legal system they adhered - be it Roman law, Frankish law, Frisian law, etc. And that, in turn, could make a world of difference in how matters like divorce and women's rights were handled.

...and now I might as well continue the rant and point out that the very notion that Islam was the first system ever to give women rights is not even true in the slightest. Frex, just look at the [Code of Hammurabi](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp) - you'll find more than a few stipulations that clearly give rights and protections to women. And on the whole, what the Code of Hammurabi has to say about women really doesn't look any worse than the commandments of the Qur'an.

(on that note: when it comes to their general attitude to gender relations, ancient Babylonia, Muhammad's society, and Classic Islamic society are probably not all that different from one another. They're certainly closer to one another than that any one of them is to our modern Western society)

Anyhoo... what really bothers me about the line of reasoning that some of the people in that thread use, is how blatantly unaware these people are of their own subjectivity. They'll happily swallow any weak argument or logical fallacy if it fits with _what they want Islam to be_, but they'll just as happily dismiss anything - even the sunnah and over a millennium of Islamic scholarly discourse - if it doesn't fit with their ideas.

The lady with the Catholic husband provides a particularly good example of this kind of subjective reasoning. I don't even mean to insult or offend her or anything - she does come across as a kind and sincere person - but I just cannot agree with her line of reasoning.

Note how she argues that the Qur'an must have a transcendant meaning beyond what it says at face value. That line of thinking does show sincere devotion - but, I'm sorry, she's really just weaving excuses to remove the Qur'an's literal meaning and fill it in with what she _feels_ that it means.

Traditional Islamic exegesis? She doesn't mention that in her line of arguing at all (...and judging from her posts and the fact that she's married to a Catholic guy, it's probably fair to assume that she's not much of a fan of traditional Islamic views)

Historical context? She does bring that up - but she doesn't actually use those historical circumstances to make a critical analysis of the Qur'an. Rather, she cherrypicks elements from history to bolster her argument (i.e. ""the commandments of the Qur'an are only there to protect us""). She makes a point of saying that ""do not let your daughters marry unbelievers"" is addressed at women's male guardians rather than the women themselves, and then she goes on to argue that this rule thus doesn't apply to her or other independent women.

But if you take a more critical look at the historical context here, one thing should immediately become apparent - the Arab society of Muhammad's time was a society where women, as a rule, had male guardians; her husband if she was married, and her father if she wasn't. This arrangement was also more or less universal in Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean (it's even referred to in Hammurabi's Code). And while there were exceptions to this rule - nuns and widows (Khadijah was the latter, btw) - there was generally no place for unmarried independent women in these societies.

Another aspect of the historic context here - and this is something that people often overlook - is that marriage in Late Antique societies was usually an affair between two families rather than two individuals. Our modern notion of two individuals choosing to marry eachother without anyone else having a say in that, that would have been quite foreign to most people from the 7th century.

So if you put that passage - ""do not marry your daughters to unbelievers"" - in that historical context, then the meaning of this verse becomes pretty clear: it's addressed to the male guardians of Muslim women because women aren't even supposed to pick their partners on their own anyway. Their family and their guardians are supposed to make that choice for them.

The lady in question argues that the limited scope of this commandment shows that it was meant to be bound to a very specific time and place anyway. But you could just as easily turn that logic on its ear and argue that this verse means that Muslim women are not only forbidden to marry unbelievers, but also that they should always let their male guardian decide who they get to marry. If you don't factor in Islamic tradition, scholarly opinion, or one's own subjective feelings, then both arguments are equally logical.

...and that's pretty much what bothers me about people of this calibre. They are very much sincere about their beliefs and what they are saying. But they're far too in love with their faith to take an even remotely clearheaded look at things. Logic and critical thinking take a backseat to the will to believe, and these people end up generously applying Crabtree's Bludgeon without even realizing it."
492,e69f4x4,"To add, there's actually imams who provide this forty day marriage service. Basically the wife is supposed to marry someone else and consummate the marriage before she can remarry her husband, so yeah, there's men lining up to provide this service.

493,e38tqjg,"[Independent article - British Pakistani study found that 85% of men convicted of grooming gang activity were “Asian.”](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/quilliam-grooming-gangs-report-asian-abuse-rotherham-rochdale-newcastle-a8101941.html)

And that is why I have a problem with immigration and it is a huge problem.

It’s you. You’re the problem. You will do everything in your power to enable the rape of children by gangs. 

You keep denying that it is a problem largely specific to the Pakistani community even after the Pakistani community largely acknowledges it...

That’s my problem. All you lunatics ranting about the “far right” because you have been educated to believe Nazis were conservatives or some similar superstitious idiocy and you think you are staving off a genocide if you just continue to allow young girls to be raped.

It really is some type of brainwashing to that effect that sensible and rational people are up against. I don’t know why you are brainwashed and other people are not.

———

The fact is that an entirely new form of criminal behaviour has been imported to the UK. Grooming gangs were not a problem in the UK and now they are.

That is an issue that needs to be addressed and the causation is Muslim men believing western women are asking to be raped based on their manner of dress. The exact same thing existed in society up until very recently- it is not a difficult concept to grasp.

The difference is Pakistanis and other minorities are acting in groups to sexually abuse and rape young girls and that behaviour is different. The gang rape and openness of exploitation is different.

———

The difference between you and me is that I am not defending sexual abuse and rape of young girls.

The traditional predatory behaviour of the European ancestry Brits that are paedophiles is to act alone- they make up 85% of those convictions which is slightly overrepresented from their share of the population that is roughly 80%.

If those men are clergy then the clergy needs to be investigated. If those men are teachers then teachers need to be investigated. If those men were athletics coaches then athletics coaches need to be investigated...

But if those men are Muslims then “Shut your dirty mouth you Islamaphobic racist!!!”

You’re the problem. Not Muslims. It’s idiots like you that want to fundamentally change society and immunize minorities from well deserved criticism. 

The fact that you don’t see a link between the way Pakistani men see their own veiled, demure, isolated, and submissive women vs. British women who are loud, assertive, provocatively dressed, engaging in haram behaviour etc. just means you are obtuse and ignorant of another culture. It doesn’t mean that other people are bigots- it is in fact the opposite.

A bigot is someone who fails to investigate another opinion or culture but instead dismisses it ignorantly. You are a bigot. You don’t understand anything about Islamic culture or the standards Muslim women are expected to meet and which the majority of western women fail horribly on every account."
494,e3vqooe,"Yeah, and you get that we're ""getting raped on a regular basis"" from which sources exactly ? I suspect that you have never ever been here, if so, then why are you making such strong suggestions about a group of people you have no clue about ? AMWF here is more prevalent here than WMAF, but these pairings are still minuscule in comparison to AMAF which is partly the reason why Buryats managed to maintain their language and customs despite being oppressed (just like every nation, including whiteys btw) by the Soviet government who tried to blend every nation in USSR into one bland Soviet mass. So yeah, that datman2345 guy isn't that far from truth, Buryat women probably aren't ""the most loyal women on Earth"" (this statetement itself is pretty stupid, but I would think that if anything, then Muslim women are the most loyal, mainly because of their religion and customs), but you won't find bullshit like ""I don't date Asian guys cuz they look like my father\\brother\\cousin\\uncle\\etc."" here and no, we aren't ""getting raped on a regular basis"", but there were some reverse incidents (like when Tuvans started killing Russians who lived in Tuva en-masse in 90s, thus decreasing their population from almost 100000 in 1989 to 60000 in 2002 and around 50000 in 2010. No one gave a shit about this, government wrote that off as ""wars between criminal elements"" and that was it, same thing happened in Chechnya btw, so if you think that minorities in Russia are subservient, then you are far from truth)."
495,e43vvkm,"I don't think they should ban it because we are a free country and people should be free to dress how they choose.  

However, the burqa needs to be recognised as a cultural choice (And one that is alien to the western culture they have chosen to live in) rather than a religious one, there is nothing in the Qaran than mentions the complete coverage of a burqa being necessary but rather simply that women dress modestly. Consequently it should get no special treatment as religious dress: Shops, public buildings and businesses should be allowed to insist it is removed the same as they do for bikers in a crash helmet (It is a safety issue, eye contact is a big part of trust in western cultures, and the anonymity provided by a burqa is a crime risk, sure most Muslim women are fine but how long before the burqa is the outfit of choice for criminal gangs since nobody knows who is under it), likewise burqa wearers should expect greater levels of police suspicion just as anyone wearing a balaclava or a hoodie and face mask would, if you choose to dress in a manner that makes you hard to identify you have to accept that makes the general public suspicious.   

So I don't think there is any reason to ban the burqa, just as things like balaclavas haven't been banned, but those who choose to wear have to accept there are consequences of wearing them: They may be asked to remove them, or not allowed in certain buildings / areas with them, and both the police and public will be suspicious of them.

497,e02vozo,"Very well, as a kindness to you, I will address your points *first*, but your continual dodging this really quite simple question is extremely telling.

&gt;Sure, but it's a terrible comparison to Australia given how different their circumstances are and the notable policy failings in regards to integration.

Sure. Fair point, Sweden is not Australia.

[Here's a fact check for Australia that shows that a huge number of Muslim men (and many more Muslim women) are unemployed in Australia](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-04/fact-check-muslim-workforce/9800656) and are not seeking work (43 per cent of working-age Muslims were not in the labour force).

The participation rate for Muslim women was 42 per cent, well below the national female working-age participation rate of 72 per cent.

For men, the picture was similar: Muslim men had the lowest participation rate at 70 per cent, compared to the national working-age male participation rate of 81 per cent, which it is worth noting is heavily dragged down by Buddhist men (77 per cent) and Aboriginal men (not cited, but extremely low), so if we were compared working age *white* men to working age Muslim men, the statistics would be terrible.

Of course, there are some reasons for this (Muslims are backwards and want women to not work, problems with integration, etc) but the point is, Buddhists and others suffer the same problems but somehow manage to do better, and Muslims are in general disproportionately welfare seekers.

&gt;lol, you just shortened a ""horrible burden"" to ""burden"".

*Horrible* burden then. Totally changes what I was writing.

&gt; I've told you repeatedly that we should try and address these issues with policy before jumping to extreme conclusions like abandoning the Refugee Convention altogether.

Which might or might not work. So far everything we've tried, so far *everything every single Western nation has tried*, has failed utterly.

It's possible there exists magical, mystical policy which will solve these problems, but it has so far eluded us in the US, in the UK, in all of Europe without exception, in Canada, New Zealand and in Australia.

&gt;Of course the behaviour should be condemned. My point is your response is incredibly extreme and unrealistic.

You *specifically* referred to the St Kilda bashing as ""some friction"". Was there ""some friction"" in Charlottesville recently?

&gt;lol, why not address my points instead of sit there dwelling on the type of person you think I must be for disagreeing with you?

Because I simply cannot understand how you can look at serious criminal activities and just say ""Eh, not my problem."" It is totally alien to me, and I wonder therefore what could bring you to those kinds of conclusions.

All I can say is that the vast majority of the country does not share your apathy.

&gt; Here, I'll spell it out for you: if crime is your priority issue then your extreme concern regarding what you admit is tiny portion of it, and which you've been repeatedly advised can be reduced with policy, is a complete waste of time by your own standards.

And I have repeatedly said, the only statistic which I care about is per-capita statistics, *especially* when the per-capita statistics reveal that certain people make poor immigrants and your solution is to say ""well there might be some way we can fix it, and they're still pretty small, so we should increase our intake until they are big enough to become a problem, then I might care.""

Do you not understand how if you take a small sample of something, and it is bad, this is an indication that a *large* sample of something will be even worse?

&gt;Not if you have good integration programs, as I keep saying.

Again, the mythical integration problems that nobody in the EU, nobody in the USA, nobody in Australia, nobody in the UK, nobody in Canada, nobody in NZ, nobody in any Western nation can figure out.

It's not like the vast majority of Western nations have had no problems. *Nobody* has figured this out yet. Not Belgium, not France, not Britain, not Spain, not Sweden... nobody. Everything they have tried has failed.

Maybe, after you've done addressing my question, you can enlighten me? What policy do you mean, and why has nobody else thought of this brilliant idea yet? How practical is it? How much will it cost? So many questions.

&gt; How can Australia be said to have done well if every single study ever performed (this isn't true in the slightest) has found multiculturalism to have a net negative effect?

Do you need a link to some studies? I'm happy to provide them, once you answer my question.

&gt;The fact you think issues with multiculturalism from wiki is somehow further evidence is also bizarre.

Hence my descriptor, ""easily digestible format"".

&gt;Can you even describe the ideology/ideologies you're using?

I genuinely prefer not to have an ideology and instead have positions, positions that are free of dogmatic guidelines and which are instead based on a case-by-case assessment of the particular topic on hand. This prevents me from having to defend positions which I do not hold.

I deliberately eschew labels as much and as often as I can. As I said, I have *positions* on specific issues.

&gt; Because I get the feeling you don't have a clue what you're on about.

I get a very similar feeling from you.

&gt; What is even considered practical is determined by your ideological framework for god sake!

You... want me to define ""practical""?

That which produces real, measurable, concrete effects which are observable in the real world, and which can be verified and their effects clearly seen and their absence missed, absent any other rational explanation and absent emotional influences.

&gt; And if you think liberal IR theory is ""fuck the economy, who needs it?"" then there really isn't anything else to say.

That seems to be your policy. You've said several times that refugees are a burden of some description, but that we have to take them -- despite the significant social costs and monetary costs -- because extremely nebulous, unclear, highly emotional factors such as ""our history of multiculturalism"" and ""our ability to influence other countries"" are good reasons to take people with extremely low employment potential and a host of social problems, even though I have been asking repeatedly for concrete examples of these benefits and you have steadfastly ignored me.

So, there. There is a line by line response to everything in your post.

Please stop dodging my question and answer it honestly, completely, and with your genuine thoughts."
498,dxwxkh0,"I'll pick your first and second one, someone else can handle the rest.

Testimony of the convicted criminals in court, where they openly stated that primary motivator for targeting was religion. Direct quote would get me banned for swearing and vulgarity, but the message was essentially that ""white non-muslim women are only fit to be used as sex toys by muslim men"". And no, in spite of islamophilic narrative spinning, Islamic law does not offer any protection to kuffar women who's men did not pay jizya. It's quite clear on the subject. Kuffar do not enjoy protections from muslims if they did not submit to muslims and pay their heathen tax.

On your second point, the nicely cleaned out link on German crime statistics is an excellent example of establishment being terrified of people's reaction to reality. They did not dare to make distinction between locals and islamic immigrants out of fear of what it will do to their democratic support. Across the board in the West, criminality of locals is in a straight up collapse, while criminality of immigrant men of arms bearing age from Maghreb, Middle Eastern and Pakistani/Afhani/Bangladeshi origin is on the levels comparable to criminality levels in their home countries.

And the main way in which statistics are polished, which is taken directly from play book of Sweden which managed to keep the lid on criminality of islamic immigrants all the way until car burning became a weekly occurrence, emergency services could not enter certain districts within certain cities, and gunshot wounds became a common occurrence that isn't even worth a newspaper article. You do this by banning publication of criminal statistics based on race or religion. That way the collapsing criminality of locals will overload the increasing criminality of immigrants in statistics, until there's enough immigrants to cause the swing in the other direction. And since the underlying trend is ""massive increase in criminality among population that is growing much faster than locals"", this is a trend that appears all but irreversible."

As a Muslim, this is a load of shit.

The real answer is the dynamics between the 2 communities. Many Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities that moved to the UK did so from mostly poorly-educated, working, lower-economic class backgrounds and many of them are involved in criminal activities (though both communities have made major strides over the past few decades). The stigma continues and there have been high profile cases where Pakistanis and Bangladeshis have been involved in sex trafficking and religious extremism whereas the Indian community has largely stayed away from criminal enterprises, emphasized education, are largely composed of educated professionals and are composed of middle to upper-middle class backgrounds.

Also, general growing Islamophobia plays a role into perceptions of largely Muslim communities in the UK and mainland Europe."

502,dvo965v,"I'm pretty center left myself (and half Muslim, although not Pakistani).

I think it's time we accept that there's a certain community of people in Britain that commits these crimes, and that it's not racist to point that out (the truth isn't racist, sorry), but on the contrary it will be the only way to stop this from happening in the future.  

These people, for some reason, happen to be Muslims from a certain region of Pakistan (and not Indian or North African or Iranian Muslims). 

I would contend that it's racist to ignore this fact. Men from these communities are, statistically, at a higher risk of committing horrendous crimes against young women and girls. 

First, criminal investigations and convictions need to take place, and not short sentences. This is criminal conspiracy to commit mass rape. The thousands of men who have drugged and raped these people need to *never see the outside of a prison cell*.

Furthermore, the community these men come from (because as we all know these are almost exclusively Pakistani) needs to be investigated, because something is clearly fucked up there. That *does not* mean treating all Pakistanis as rapists, but the reasons why this is happening need to be determined and excised. *Something* is perpetuating this behaviour in that subculture, and that needs to not be given a safe haven anywhere. I suggest we start by looking at ultra conservative nutjob religious figures who perpetuate this idea that non Muslim women are whores fit to be raped.

Ppl just run with their baseless assumptions n act like they’re not even talking about real sentient women who have their own views n beliefs n who, you know, you can actually talk *to*, instead of just talk *about*.

I think that the terms, Racist, sexist, islamophobe, transphobe are labels dished out by predominantly lower middle-class graduates of certain political leanings, with degrees in subjects that have been created in the last 40 years specifically to monetise a section of society who would otherwise be non-productive.

An emergent property of this is an increase in divisive language and labelling of other sections of society of lower social class specifically so the narrative can be controlled by the artificially elevated section of society, made up of self-described ""victims"" of various types of discrimination.

Classism is far, far more pervasive in Britain than racism, And whenever the term ""racist"" is used it is being used to denigrate the person with an opposing point of view.

Mixed race people are discriminated against by black people more than white, But it doesn't get mentioned because it isn't white folk doing it.

Physically and mentally disabled people are discriminated against to the point of death with alarming regularity, But it isn't spoke about because disabled people don't get into university.

People with criminal records are routinely discriminated against and kept out of employment positions they would be perfect for, but we don't talk about it because they are men, who don't go to university.

Poor white girls are gang-raped  by predominantly Pakistani Muslims but we don't talk about it because Islamic men are victims first, and the police and social workers are from a different social class than the people who are raped so they think they deserve it.

Boys are ""falling behind"" from nursery, It's fucking bollocks, They are discriminated against, by middle-class, liberal women, who don't like/respect working class people, Because working-class children know when someone smells like extinction.

Transpeople are 50x more likely to have HIV, But that's not there fault, it's discriminatory to expect somebody to behave with a little self-respect, 60% have substance abuse issues, But that is nothing to do with their personal choices, it's discriminatory to say so, It is also fine for them to beat the fuck out of women in sports competitions because they are ""real women"".

Islamic and African women have their sexuality stolen from them at birth by idiot fucking men, But the feminists won't mention it, Lest they lose their special status as professional victims to a bunch of women who are truly marginalised.

how would you know how prevalent racism is if you are white? or how prevalent sexism is if you are a man? dont you think these are things which are *by definition* outside your experience? im a white guy and i can say i have never once felt like the victim of racism or sexism in my life. so i dont think my own experience is a good basis to get a sense of how prevalent these issues are.

no offence but thats literally you making things up.

&gt;Classism is far, far more pervasive in Britain than racism

so just to head off this whataboutism, i agree class is a problem. however i want to talk about racism in this thread, so lets stay on topic and try to avoid the whataboutisms.

&gt;Mixed race people are discriminated against by black people more than white, But it doesn't get mentioned because it isn't white folk doing it.

we arent just talking about the actions of individual racists, on individual people in society. we are talking about people in positions of power in government, either wittingly or unwittingly acting in a way that causes divergent outcomes for whites and nonwhites.

everyone in society is potentially exposed being treated in a racist way by other individuals. however, only nonwhite people are at risk of being treated in a structurally racist way by the institutuions of the state in the UK.

&gt;Physically and mentally disabled people are discriminated against to the point of death with alarming regularity, But it isn't spoke about because disabled people don't get into university.

so to head off another whataboutism, discrimination agaisnt disabled people is also a problem. you will see that in fact labour has recently made several changes to elevate the concerns of the disabled voices in the party. but lets stick to racism since thats the topic of this thread.

&gt;People with criminal records are routinely discriminated against and kept out of employment positions they would be perfect for, but we don't talk about it because they are men, who don't go to university.

this is also a problem (boy we have a lot of problems dont we?) but its a whataboutism here, so lets leave it there for now.

&gt;Poor white girls are gang-raped by predominantly Pakistani Muslims but we don't talk about it because Islamic men are victims first, and the police and social workers are from a different social class than the people who are raped so they think they deserve it.

who isnt talking about it? maybe the mainstream liberals arent talking about it but this got discussed a lot in my CLP. the men are being prosecuted / have been prosecuted. what more do you think there is to say here that isnt being said?

&gt;Boys are ""falling behind"" from nursery, It's fucking bollocks, They are discriminated against, by middle-class, liberal women, who don't like/respect working class people, Because working-class children know when someone smells like extinction.

guess what, this is another problem to go on our list, the existence of which doesnt diminish any of the other problems you mentioned. so lets agree this is a problem and leave it here for noe while we fcosu on racism which is the topic of this thread.

&gt;Transpeople are 50x more likely to have HIV, But that's not there fault, it's discriminatory to expect somebody to behave with a little self-respect,

whats this got to do with anything?

&gt;60% have substance abuse issues

whats this got to do with anything?

&gt;It is also fine for them to beat the fuck out of women in sports competitions because they are ""real women"".

whats this got to do with anything?


In summary: society has lots of problems. The people affected by each problem are going to be the best and loudest advocates for their problems. The existence of problems for poor white people doesnt diminished the problems for poor nonwhite people, or vice versa.

Now, do you want to talk about racism or not?"

507,dsbuqry,"Short need to know: Triple Talaq is the Muslim rule that a man can divorce a woman by saying 'talaq' to her three times.

&gt;Banning the practice of a husband divorcing his wife by uttering ""talaq"" three times within Muslim communities has been under discussion in India for years now. The practice has rendered hundreds of Muslim women homeless, forced out of their matrimonial homes overnight, with many learning that they have been divorced from relatives, by phone or even by a text message. A recent study found that 79 percent of women divorced through ""triple talaq"" did not receive any maintenance from their former husbands. Despite the Supreme Court having declared the practice void in August last year, activists on the ground confirm that it continues unabated.  

&gt;Last week the lower house of the parliament passed a bill seeking to criminalise instant ""triple talaq"". If the bill is voted into a law, men found guilty of divorcing their wives through ""triple talaq"" could face jail time of up to three years.

Feminists want to put men in jail. In other news, the sun rose again, maintaining its unbroken streak of several billion years.

&gt;The reactions to the ""triple talaq"" bill within the Muslim community have been varied.

&gt;As a feminist, what has troubled me the most are critics of the bill saying we should reject it because it is a right-wing government that is putting it forward. Equally disturbing are claims that the criminalisation of ""triple talaq"" could be misused with it being a ploy to jail more Muslim men.

[Because the Hindu women already use the rape law to extort and jail men?](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/false-rape-cases-in-delhi-delhi-commission-of-women/1/409320.html)

&gt;Critics also argue that the government, as well as Muslim women, are likely to misuse the law. They say that survivors of ""triple talaq"" are guided merely by concerns of maintenance and economic security and not dignity.

Marriage is not about love or dignity. Marriage about MONEY. It is one of the few things that the Oriental world gets right and that the Occidental world has allowed itself to sink into delusion about."

The crime happen in one of the less white populated area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets#Demographics); I quote ""Tower Hamlets has one of the smallest White British populations of any local authority in Britain.""...""According to the 2011 census, 34.5% of the population was Muslim"".  
And why? I don't think those people have any good reason to rape  
  
&gt;not doing the same in a thread about white criminals is racist  
  
Why would you assume we don't do the same to white people?  
The crime happen in a vastly non-white area. The logic/statistics would lead to a non-white attacker.  
I don't know, people are not blaming Weinstein because he is white maybe ?  
  
&gt;What does Islam have to do with the crime in the first place?  
  
It is cultural in Muslims countries that:  
- Women are lower than men  
- Non muslim person are not worth muslim person  
- A women without hijab is a whore  
  
Now you mix all those 3 things and that's why Islam might have something to do with it.  
I would like to add that in muslim countries/culture there is a big problem with sexuality. Because sexuality is normal for all humans, but it is seen as bad/dirty in their culture. Which leads people to do weird stuff because they were never educated about sex.    
  
&gt;And do these same people bring up Christianity or secularism when it's actual white criminals? No? Why is that you think?  
  
Maybe not so much people nowadays gang-rape young girl because their religion taught them that non-muslim women are whores and worthless  
Anyway, I don't like religions in general. So I would be the first to criticize any religion.    
  
&gt;Where is your proof Islam was behind this crime?  
  
No proof so far, but I don't understand what it has to do with the right to criticize Islam. Islam is an ideology. All ideologies can be criticized. Like Capitalism and Communism, Islam is an ideology (Doctrine, philosophy, body of beliefs or principles belonging to an individual or group.)

Vastly? 45% of the people in that area are white.

&gt;It is cultural in Muslims countries that:
- Women are lower than men
- Non muslim person are not worth muslim person
- A women without hijab is a whore

Setting aside that this is a shit meme that ignores the 100s of countries, ethnicities, cultures, and more than 72 different ways Islam is interpreted, this is literally something that can be said of every group living in Tower Hamlets. But how many times does a submission in /r/news about white criminals or criminals that are not Muslim blame their culture or religion? Yet here, where there is no evidence about who did what, people are happily blaming groups of people they hate. The mods stepped in to stop this bigotry which, as we have seen with other subreddits, is how the brigades take over default subs to turn them into alt-lite subs.

&gt;I would like to add that in muslim countries/culture there is a big problem with sexuality. Because sexuality is normal for all humans, but it is seen as bad/dirty in their culture. Which leads people to do weird stuff because they were never educated about sex.

&gt;Maybe not so much people nowadays gang-rape young girl because their religion taught them that non-muslim women are whores and worthless

So when a gangrape happens and the criminals are non-Muslim, is that because of their religion? After all, according to the Bible infidels are going to hell.

&gt;No proof so far, but I don't understand what it has to do with the right to criticize Islam. Islam is an ideology. All ideologies can be criticized

If you have a hard time understanding why the moderators would clamp down on this bigotry, imagine if the posters were blaming Judaism and Jews. I'm sure that should put it in a context for you to see why allowing that sort of bigotry is unacceptable.

&gt;No proof so far, but I don't understand what it has to do with the right to criticize Islam. Islam is an ideology. All ideologies can be criticized

You're not criticising Islam. First of all, because you are ignorant of Islamic teachings. Second of all, because the reason you and others are claiming Islam has anything to do with this is because of the alt-right memes about ""Londonistan"".

There is no evidence that Islam had anything to do with this crime. And the reason the posters from T_D and other subs are brinning in Islam is because they think the criminals are non-white immigrants, which makes them Muslim in their eyes, especially in London. The moderators rightly see the veiled bigotry and are removing comments that have nothing to do with the crime.

Nah, that sub is not mine or yours. And when was the last time you and others went to that sub and started blaming white male culture or Christianity or secularism when white criminals raped a girl?

Moreover, the brigades are pushing to be seen as rape, when the police are calling it sexual assault. The reason they this is because the alt-right brigades have an agenda, and that is to label any sexual assault as rape if they think it was done by a non-white or an immigrant. "

You also can't have a character who isn't in some way defined by their sex or ethnicity. Going back to that black character, they still have to be better dancers than the whites or maybe a smooth talking jive type of guy. The muslim still has to do things like pray on screen or refuse pork or alcohol. Also, if the muslim is a woman whe needs to wear a headscarf but it must be clear that she's happy with wearing it because you don't want to give the impression that muslim women are forced to cover up, they just choose to because of culture or whatever.

1% seems like a small number or you can realize that muslims being only 7% of the french population make up to 50-70% of **all** criminals. just because the rest isn't in jail, doesn't mean they like non muslims.

because it's the muslim people who hate infidels and believe in an ideology that advocates to killing non muslims. not just because a country is at war. it's the mindset of the people that's different.     
you know how oppressed muslim women are in general? they have no respect. they see white women as even worse.

**Gender justice, in fact** 

 ______ 
While examining the discrimination within Hindu law, the continuation of the Hindu undivided family property is perceived as its main lacuna. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar) While examining the discrimination within Hindu law, the continuation of the Hindu undivided family property is perceived as its main lacuna. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)

The affidavit filed by the government of India before the Supreme Court and the questionnaire released by the law commission on the uniform civil code have rightly given rise to apprehensions among the Muslim community. These apprehensions could have been avoided since the concern towards gender justice is directed towards the Muslim community and projects Hindu law as egalitarian, uniform and gender-just. The media seems to echo this position and most talk shows are also framed within this faulty framework. But nothing can be farther from the truth. It is time to examine Hindu laws, customs and social ethos for their gender-unjust practices.

While examining the discrimination within Hindu law, the continuation of the Hindu undivided family property is perceived as its main lacuna. Several discriminatory aspects of Hindu cultural practices that govern the laws of marriage, divorce and matrimonial life are seldom held up to scrutiny. The ritual of kanyadaan (sacrificial offering of the bride to the groom), an essential condition of a Hindu marriage, the notion of girls as paraya dhan (belonging to the other), the pious obligation of a Hindu father to marry off his daughter, which then gives boost to dowry, and the view that Hindu marriages are sacramental, still dominate Hindu social ethos and judicial discourse.

Only last month, a judgement of the Supreme Court held that a wife’s refusal to live within a joint family, and her demand for a separate residence, amounts to cruelty to the husband. Such a verdict would never have been delivered on a marriage governed by Christian or Parsi laws. It could only have been delivered in a case governed by Hindu law since the notion of separation violates the Hindu ethos of a joint family. Though Hindu marriage was transformed into a contract in 1955, sacramental aspects still dominate the social psyche and parents prefer to send the daughter back to her matrimonial home rather than risk having a divorcee on their hands. Despite acute domestic violence, girls are sent back to their homes even when there is a risk of them being killed or driven to suicide.

In contrast, a Muslim marriage, since its inception, is a civil contract — a view later adopted by English and continental European laws.

Conditions are incorporated into the contract. While among urban, middle and upper-class Hindus there is greater likelihood of women opting for divorce, in rural areas women are less likely to do the same even when faced with cruelty or desertion as marriage is deemed to offer them protection. The concept of the permanence of marriage is visible not just in our public life, but in litigation in family courts, where women are constantly advised by judges to return home to save their marriages even when they face great risks. Women, too, believe that even if their husbands are abusive, it is better to remain married, since the symbols of marriage — the mangalsutra and sindoor — are perceived as marks of respect, status and protection against advances from other men.

Statistics show that divorce among Muslims is higher. But it is seldom highlighted that desertion among Hindus is far higher. In Maharashtra, a popular term used to describe such women is “paritatya mahila” or “discarded women”.

While the system of dowry has spread its tentacles across castes and communities, its roots in upper-caste Hindu cultural tradition cannot be overlooked. Muslim law started with the notion of mehr, an amount that must be stipulated in the marriage contract (nikahnama) as a future security to the bride. Gradually, under the dominant Hindu influence, the community has accepted the anti-women custom of dowry. So, while the mehr amounts have been reduced to a mere token, huge amounts are demanded as dowry.

While all religions are patriarchal and exert strict control over a woman’s sexuality, the hold of Brahminical patriarchy reaches a high pitch when we examine the phenomenon referred to as “honour killings”. While the Hindu law provided for marriages across all Hindu denominations, rigid caste boundaries prevail. A girl can be killed by her own parents for transgressing caste boundaries and marrying someone from a lower caste — a reality captured in the recent popular Marathi movie, Sairat. At times, young couples are also killed for entering into sagotra and sapinda marriages, concepts unique to Hindus that have been incorporated in the codified Hindu law, while in parts of South India marriages between first cousins and uncle and niece are the norm.

While Muslim polygamy is projected as a major bane affecting Muslim women, outlawing polygamy does not appear to be an effective solution when we examine the prevalence of bigamy among Hindus. Official reports reveal that despite the statutory restraint, incidents of bigamy are more frequent among Hindus than Muslims. Ironically, the worst sufferers of this have been Hindu women, who are denied their basic right of maintenance and sustenance when the husband pleads that the woman is his second wife. In comparison, the Muslim woman in a bigamous marriage fares better since she is entitled to rights of maintenance, shelter, dignity and equal status. A Hindu second wife is not only stripped of her rights, but also divested from her status as “wife” and humiliated as mistress or concubine in judicial discourse. An example is the adverse comments made by Justice Markandey Katju in 2011 in the D. Velusamy vs D. Patchaiammal case. A Hindu husband enjoys the privilege of denying maintenance to a woman with whom he has cohabited, and may even have fathered children, merely by pleading during court proceedings that he has violated the mandate of monogamy without any criminal consequences visiting him.

In 2005, in the Rameshchandra Daga vs Rameshwari Daga case, the Supreme Court conceded that despite codification and introduction of monogamy, the ground reality had not changed much and that Hindu marriages, like Muslim marriages, continued to be bigamous. The apex court was trying to award maintenance to a woman whose husband had challenged the validity of their marriage because of his previous marriage. The court also commented that though such marriages are illegal as per the provisions of the codified Hindu law, they are not “immoral” and hence a financially-dependent woman cannot be denied maintenance. If Hindu women, like Muslim women, are given rights, the destitution and humiliation that they suffer will be greatly reduced. Against such convincing evidence of anti-women practices, can we assume that the codified Hindu law has been instrumental in bringing social transformation? It has not provided the foundation upon which a uniform and gender-just family code for Indians across religious communities can be mounted.

If it is accepted that all personal laws, customs and practices are patriarchal, where does the process of change to bring in gender-just laws begin? Here, we must accept two premises: First, our laws are not uniformly gender-unjust. They contain specific forms of gender injustice and each must be addressed within its own specificity. Second, the law is dynamic and gets formulated within the contested terrain of litigation. Our Constitution provides us the yardstick for testing its gender discrimination. Supreme Court verdicts provide scope to challenge specific gender unjust provisions. Judgements such as Shamim Ara (2002) and Danial Latifi (2001) have shown the way forward. Unfortunately, these landmark rulings have been under-reported due to which the impression continues that Muslim women have no rights until a uniform civil code is enacted.

But what we *really* want to say is that it's ol' whitey oppressing Muslims.

Ah, I see you're ahead of me.  

&gt;Now I don't like a lot of the social policies and cultural attitudes in the Middle East. But I'm not so caught up in my self-righteous bullshit that I believe that they're victims of their own religion. They choose to live their lives like this because it's what they want.

515,fic5ts6,"&gt; t is a fact that the Battle of Badr was in response to the pagans who kicked out the Muslims and confiscated all their wealth and property. It's only fair that they try to take back some of what is theirs

This has been a myth perpetrated to make it seem like Mohammad was trying to be fair. However Moh's action and the Quran disagrees with you.

&gt;You'll see that there is nothing in any Ayah you quoted that says to fight [indiscriminately].

Read what I posted again in the Quran and you will see that this is not true.

&gt;Your claim is quite ridiculous and trivial to dispute. For instance, Muslim men are allowed to marry Jewish or Christian women. So they can't be their enemy. 

Your claim is ridiculous, as wives are expected to convert. Note that muslim women are not allowed to marry non-muslim men.

&gt; have no idea who's feeding you these falsities.

Again being dishonest. You can see from Moh' actions and his instructions in the quran that what I am saying is true."
516,fczu7ee,"Long post :) ... Just post need discussion then simply reply. I will try. 

First of all majority of Muslim women are not literate and education is not encouraged in Muslim women, they are expected to take care of home, give birth to children and take of husband, also take care of husband parents. They are financially dependant on husband so don't have much choice except accepting what husband, Mohd and Quran commands. 

Why God did so much discrimination is difficult to explain if you are believer because Islam doesn't like raising questions on Mohd and Quran. That is treated as blasphemy punishable by death sentence in Muslim countries.  As a exmuslim I think that Mohd was smart and intelligent person yet greedy for sex and power. He used God and his book as tool to attract poor and young people towards his faith and slowly build army. Men were supposed to fight in war and women were supposed to take care of home and kids hence men status was much higher because he was warrior killing enemy or sacrificing his life to protect the follower of Faith. He slowly captured many territories around Madina and when he grew in power with more men joining his faith he captured Mecca which was trade center at that time. Sex was the only entertainment and reward for his warrior so he permitted everything and anything. With these circumstances you can understand why men were superior for Mohd.

In today's world when no war and both men women shouldering equal responsibility then all these looks highly unjustified. 

I hope I clear your doubt. In short, Islam is a political ideology rather than religion to capture land and power and that is what for Muslim are struggling everywhere."
517,f7hpyml,"You're corroborating everything Robert Spencer has written about the military and intelligence services....how he was declared personna non gratta under Obama after giving them multiple seminars under Bush....and how they were subsequently purged of ANY reference to Jihad terror. James Clapper was clueless enough to claim in Congressional testimony that the Muslim Brotherhood was ""a secular organization""....and John Brennan is perhaps himself a closet Muslim....(he seems to have converted when he was CIA station chief in Saudi Arabia, though the evidence is circumstantial; he married a Muslim woman....and Muslim women are forbidden by Islamic law to marry infidel men; to this day, he refuses to comment on his religious affiliation, which is odd to say the least).

In 'The Art of War', Sun Tzu insisted we must ""know our enemy"". Obama made that impossible, and deliberately so. Trump is too preoccupied with the impeachment proceedings to correct the problem....(though there's no guarantee he would have corrected it anyway). 

There is a massive ignorance in our (the USA's) collective understanding of Islam, and it is a deliberate and willful one, cultivated and directed by Muslim advocacy groups like CAIR...and imposed on us by the liberal establishment."
518,ej64p5r,"The women u see ripping it off is a tiny tiny tiny percent that get amplified by media like reddit. Majority wear it by choice because it is a religious matter. Europe used to have lots of veils too back in the day. And Saudi Arabia and Iran represent a small fraction of the muslim world not many muslims really like their governments especially saudi arabia. Its just western demonisation of Islam has made it so that any religious symbols of islam are called ""oppression"" because reddit sees a pic of one iranian women and than thinks that all muslim women are forced. It reminds me of one thing i read. Western countries will use the guise of feminism in order to jusitfy Middle eastern imperialism. Thats exactly what we are seeing now. Islam is the new 21st century enemy of the media. People wondered how jews were demonised in the 30s and 40s, how blacks were kept as slaves, how native americans were slaughtered, well u are seeing the same thing about islam now. Demonise a population so much that people dont care if you kill them. Thats how American imperialism is justified in the middle east."

&gt;Hajj money is being used for educating muslims - not a pro hindu policy (but good one as such)

earlier money was being given to incentivise a religious pilgrimage. Changing to educational help is just another step towards removing the discriminatory nature of the Indian state

&gt;That's not pro hindu, but still somewhat acceptable.

Why is acting against Islamist extremists not pro-hindu? How is ensuring equal application of law and stopping minority appeasement not ""pro-hindu""?

&gt;Again, this is not pro hindu.

So now promoting Indian heritage and culture is not ""pro-hindu"". lol wut?

It definitely does affect Hindus.For starters, it calls out the hypocrisy of the minoritarian agenda of the so-called ""secular"" parties, it divides the enemy camp,and it gives more agency to women, one more step to ensuring that Muslim women are not used as baby-making machines

Debatable, but irrelevant"
522,e1hylzx,"You've fallen into the liberal trap. Their logical fallacy is that they think that because an enemy of the islamic world is our enemy, they must be our friend. It would be more accurate to say that they are two enemies who hate each other and we'd best get rid of them both.

I do despise muslims but not because of their colour or ethnicity or anything like that. I despise them because islam is an evil ideology. 

Those 'moderate' muslim women are actually not muslims, they are apostates - that is why they are always raped and killed by islamic men.
Islam is immutable according to its scriptures and cannot be changed. 

'Moderate muslims' are not muslims. They believe in a faith of their own which happens to be derived from islam. And there's nothing wrong with that. 

I'm actually a marxist. Religion is a tool of oppression. The major religions are all anti-human. Religion doesn't have to be anti-human but the major ones simply are. I'm saying this because I just *know* people will be calling racist/nazi/whatever because I'm islamophobic.
"
523,dwj8l18,"Secularism is opposed to the Shariah which, although painted with a bad image, has objectives In which preserve the life, intellect, dignity and honour, religion and lineage of a person (not just a Muslim but also those who have entered into a contract of protection with the Muslims) 

However, secularism is based on utilitarian principles which are intrinsically flawed. Utilitarianism argues that whichever action causes the greater happiness is to be done. However, this causes huge implications where a minority is at the expense of the majority. For example there are Jewish and Muslim minorities and if the majority wanted to kill them then this would take place. Even if we look to medical ethics, these are based on utilitarian values which if you've studied say to yourself this is the most stupid ethic ever. I guarantee. 

Anyways back to the Shariah. The examples you gave are far fetched in understanding. There are opinions of killing an apostate yes, but some scholars such as ibn taymiyyah didn't hold that opinion. Rather they were to be left alone and given dawah to to return this was because if we looked at the life of the Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon him, every apostate wasn't killed. Some we're but as some scholars put forward that in order to kill an apostate they'd have to be actively against the Muslims not just in arms but also if they became Muslim and learnt some secrets and apostated to help the enemy. This, in modern terms is known as treason and it IS punishable even from western standards. 

Also with stoning. That's to do with adultery and you need 4 witnesses. Not four random people but these have to be reliable and pious etc. There's a bar for witnesses. This shows us that the actual sexual act has to be seen BUT no one commits adultery out in the open and NO ONE can implement stoning if adultery is done within a person's own home. 

Also, myself being a woman who covers up I feel elevated to where such clothes. As I'm not treated as a sexual object which feminism has accidently lead rise to. Women go our there feeling they can wear whatever they want but they are lending themselves to be looked at with desire and objects rather being treated as humans. When you see a Muslims women covered in the correct hijab you don't think to yourself about sex or desire you don't think much. And that's respect. I'm not something to be desired. Whereas as a woman wearing a bikini and tight clothes shows the world she has little self respect to herself and men will think dirty thoughts to themselves (generally speaking not all men are like that) this is by the words of peter vardy a philosopher who actually thinks Muslim women are empowered through their dress and as far as I'm aware he's non-muslim. Additionally there are scientific researchers which show that when men see the body of a woman the part of their brain with seeing them as emotions is switched off. That is, they're seen as simply objects. So really, people nowadays are sheep they're scared to stick out. "
524,dvuz0jo,"&gt;Can you talk me about the ""Theory of Degeneracy"" that explains how the era in which starts woman become the ruling class begins the social decline of said civilization?


I would not lay the blame on women, not entirely; however generally speaking societies that become more *androgynous* or out and out *feminine* generally are ones which rapidly begin to fall.

Throughout human history, there's never been a powerful, large-scale ""matriarchal"" society. In fact the general rule of Matriarchal societies is that they generally end up as unadvanced tribes or nomads--not quite nation builders.

This isn't to say women are antithetical to society, in fact they play an exceptionally important role in it. I believe Oswald Spengler was the one who said that women generally carry the genus of society within them because *typically* they're the ones at home raising their boys to become men. So you can say that Islamic Women are oppressed by Islamic Men, but it would arguably be far more accurate to say that Islamic Women *create* Islamic Men.

The problem with Women in major leadership roles however, is that women for the most part evolved with an entirely different view of society from men. Men were, for the most part, bound to their tribe: The land they were on was where they would farm food, they had the duty of protecting their tribe with force of arms and should they fail, they'd be sold into slavery or killed on the spot, men had to look after themselves and the tribe was the best vehicle to do that.

Women however, had arguably a more ""lucky"" fate in that they were something of a resource in much the same way food and water was: they didn't have to tend to their own crop, but rather marry a man with a field to farm on, and should the ""tribe"" fall then they would be assimilated into the new tribe, given new husbands, give birth to new sons, so on. Tribal loyalty is not a quality *inherent* in Women and so it had to be enforced by Social Taboos and Force: You had the Rape of The Sabine Women which ended with them begging their brothers and fathers not to fight their husbands and instead peacefully submit to Roman Rule--this is after the Romans *kidnapped* and *raped* them. You have *Rahab* in the Old Testament who betrayed her own people, letting her neighbors and brothers and sisters be killed en masse by the Tribes of Israel. Hell I remember years ago reading an article which found that in a prison where there was no gender-segregation among the prison guards--I.E. Female Guards were overseeing Male Prisoners--a majority of the women were not only becoming *lovers* of the prisoners they were guarding, but some even got *their names tattoo'd on them*.

The archtype of the female betraying her ""tribe"" seems to be a universal one, which is why one of the values men look for in women is loyalty *precisely*, it's why the noble women in history--such as the Queen of Sparta--were made noble precisely because they were willing to commit suicide over being captured in spite of capture likely being a more merciful fate.

So when you have women come to power, they don't put the interests of the *nation*, the *tribe* first, but rather are more motivated by ""helping people"" and liberal causes--if only Males voted we'd see America as far more right wing than it is currently, the division between pro and anti refugee movements is almost entirely a gendered one wherein Men see it (rightfully I believe) as an invasion of foreign peoples, as letting the enemy in the gates, whilst Women see it more as a kind of vague humanitarianism.

Secondly you have the case of Modern Feminism which is absolutely the worst thing to befall women and--to some extent--society at large. First in the case of female suffrage: the suffragettes were opposed by women in the beginning, *primarily* because those women imagined that  if they'd be given the right to vote, they'd be expected to serve in the military. This was because voting was almost *entirely* originally seen as a tradeoff, you earned the right to vote when you accepted the *responsibility* that came with it: that you would have to defend the national body with your life, and in some cases it went further than that at insisted you be a property owner too! You essentially had to have material bonds ensuring your loyalty to *the Nation* in order to have a say on national policy.

When women were given the vote, this more than anything else--even Universal Male Suffrage--moved us away from this idea of voting as a *Civic Duty*, as something that came with responsibility and sacrifices, but to a right inherent in every single person. It philosophically opened the door to voting by inmates, to this illegal immigrant debacle, to a whole host of problems because it just said anyone *can* vote, everyone has a *right* to vote, even if not everyone is equal nor equally bound to the nation.

Still, things can be *maintained* if you still keep some of the social taboos and strong men can reel in women--generally speaking as long as Marriages and the family are strong, women will mimic their husband's views. However Feminism soon was attacking *that*: it wanted more women in the workforce, equal pay, no-fault divorces (which is a disaster for marriage) and then gradually dissolution of the social taboos: open marriages/relationships, an end to ""slut shaming"", encouraging female promiscuity. What you end up with is that traditional feminine values are taught less and less, women spend their younger years acting like ""sluts"" and when the biological clock keeps ticking louder and louder they'll realize that the men aren't calling anymore, and they can either pin down a ""beta"" male they secretly resent for more financial security, or spend their middle age alone and growing increasingly bitter. Women in the workforce, being encouraged both via social shaming and hiring quotas, similarly brings more trouble on the woman because they *always* want to marry up, and so they end up *embarrassed* if they make more money than their husband, or if their husband becomes a stay-at-home father, it's unnatural for them, like wearing someone else's skin.

So what you end up with is angry, dissatisfied women, voting for increasingly liberal policies which harm them and the nation as a whole without what essentially amounts to a man to temper them. You end up with the dissolution of the family, more social shaming of masculinity (under the guise of attacking ""toxic masculinity"", toxic going from an adjective to a verb there) then you create a society which cannot defend itself, which second guesses itself constantly, and opens the gates to its own destruction under the guise of ""humanitarian compassion""."
525,dv43jxd,"Looking at your post history, it seems that you are posting this and similar Christian propaganda stories all over the subreddits related to the Middle East. However, you seem to be genuine, so I will try to explain a few things to you.

So first, I think that you really need to have a better understanding of Oman. Oman is a religiously diverse country. The majority of Omanis are Ibadhi, a less common sect of Islam. Oman is the only country in the world where there is a majority Ibadhi population. They are generally fairly open and tolerant people. In addition, there are Sunni and Shi’a Muslims, Christians, Hindus and others living together without religious conflict. There are churches and at least one Hindu temple in addition to the much more common mosques. 

Your story is based on the premise that Muslim  women are just property. That is not the case in Oman, definitely not to the extent that this video implies. Domestic violence is an issue everywhere, and Christians justify their abuse in the same way that the father from this video did. Like the US, rural areas in the Middle East are more conservative, and as a result they may have more issues with some of these social issues than in big cities. Those are social problems, not necessarily religious problems. For this story to imply that men should convert to Christianity because there is no domestic violence in Christian households is absurd. It is not a convincing story, because the underlying premise is wrong. The Muslims that would beat their children or wife because they felt it was their duty (if they exist in Oman) are the equivalent of the snake-handling Pentecostals in the U.S., a very small group that holds beliefs that are not widely shared or enforced by their communities or culture.

The video was created by people without knowledge of the culture or reality of life, at least in Oman. It isn’t persuasive. 

I think that if you are from Florida, you may not have an opportunity to interact with Muslims apart from what you see on TV, or what members of your Pentecostal community tell you Muslims are like, which is often inaccurate and intentionally distorted to make Muslims look like your enemy and to reinforce your group’s belief that they are the “true” religious group.

Proselytizing seems to be a passion for you, and you seem sincere, but I don’t think that you have a good grasp of what the world is like outside of your community. I would recommend taking a step back from trying to convince everyone to think like you do, and instead try to find out what other people think, believe, hope for and feel. I have learned that people are very similar all over the world, with the same capabilities and flaws. You can learn from others and accept them for who they are instead of trying to force your beliefs on others, and you will have much more positive interactions online and in person."

Then black comes in and states that she shouldn't wear a hijab because it's ""problematic iconography"" which, let's be honest is a little bit bigoted, but then when the mods reprimanded him he was so POLITE about it that he came off as a reasonable dude despite his stance and then the mods ban him, making him even MORE sympathetic!

Mind you, I was always TERRIFIED that I would’ve to go back to that country because I did not share any of their beliefs and felt like an outcast there. And all this happened in extremely tolerant Holland. If this country decided to ban hijab, my family would have literally force us to go back to our home country and I would’ve had no say in it whatsoever because I was just a child under their custody. I’m thankful that I’m an adult now and don’t live with them anymore, but it was such a terrifying feeling for me as a young girl that I would be forced to go back to a country I no longer considered home. Because I know the feeling all too well, I do not wish it in any other girl. It’s really better for those young girls from Muslim families to keep being exposed to secular values while not villainizing yourself causing the parents to forcefully take them. I’d rather wish that the secular states accepted these youngsters so that they end the oppression with their parents generation. Chasing them away will create another generation of parents who are indoctrinated in poor land."
531,fx098p4,"I have expained the Ahmadi position on stoning I dont think I need to further clarify. Ahmadis value hadith, Seerah and all other early Islamic sources. But we have methodology.

Any narration must be able to witshstand historical and scientific comprison/verification.

Yes. I have read his book many times. And I have also read your article before. You are inferring things he never said. The Ahmadi position on this issue is crystal clear. If a Muslim women are raped in the process of war, and married Non-Muslim women are captured during the process of war, they can be marry Muslim men with their marriages to their Non-Muslim husbands automatically void. Mirza Bashir Ahmad (ra) clearly says:
&gt;Mukātabat is open to every female prisoner, it shall be assumed with regards 
to such a woman who does not benefit from this, that she desires to sever her 
past relations and become a part of the Islāmic society. Hence, in this case it 
cannot be objectionable for a relationship to be established between her and a 
Muslim man.

This does not fit any definition of rape. Secondly, I am sure you already knew very well in Ahmadi fiqh any intimate relation with a slave MUST be proceed by marriage first."
532,fxiyqrk,"Im going respond with this here, hope you may have the time to read this! (bcos it is pretty long)


Ohh ok about the misogyny:

From what ive read it seems like your husband is misogynistic. I dont want to interfere with any relationship or snoop around other people’s business AT ALL, but i wanna say you should probably have an open conversation with him if you feel he would accept it, hopefully he knows you well and can accept your views. Just state your problems on your liberty and how youre drifting away from islam and Allah. Maybe just dont blame it on him, but just hint at the fact that you are having a problem with what he says about women in general, by calling them “slutty” - in any way, that is not right since its a haram accusationof fornication or anything of the like. 

For most of the existence of the religion, Islamic portrayal of a family is nearly patriarchal, in the Quran as well. Let’s be honest, Islam does have its patriarchal roots. But these roots in themselves comes from the Jahiliyyah period. what i see it as is that Islam was like the shoot of the plant from the dark roots, which led to it laying the foundations for rights for women at the time. It doesnt necessarily promote the ideas that one may find as misogynistic in a good light, and it doesnt encourage it either. 

“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women” - youve got to think back to the time in 7th century Arabia, when a household’s was in a typical patriarchal system with the men being something like a shepherd and the women staying at home- OR, more relevantly, probably 98% of the fighters for muslims and the prophet (saw) were all men. I think from just these two examples alone you can tell that the quran is referring to those who earn for their wives and defending their home nation when saying men are the protectors of women. This whole men= breadwinners was not atypical to that society at that time, but now it is, since we have progressed to a time when we dont need to herd sheep or defend our land, so we can both work- on this matter, Islam doesnt forbid muslim women from working either, think back to khadijah, a businesswoman. 

The whole protecting and maintaining thing is not nature, but it’s from history from the earliest times of man when the wars were fought by men and 

Now, im not going to do apologetics for the hitting you wife part- i guess you look for my arguments that someone would say anywhere, but maybe you could look at what r/muslimsrespond to that i guess, it has a whole index of rebuttals to allegations and the like, it might be able to clear doubts. 

What that post said about 4:34 was that it was revealed after when the woman came to the prophet (saw) about the topic. As a matter of fact, if you take the verse at a more holistic field of view, it looked at touching your wife with scorn/disdain, seeming as it was described as a last resort for the marriage contract. However, women in the Quran instead of just being told to endure the relationship like men, are given the right to divorce.

The reason why muslim women are not allowed to marry men from the people of the book is because of the marriage system i think, the mahr, not being able to fit into christian or jewish traditions because the muslim man has to give  dowry to the woman.


I think why hell is said to have more women than men is because even from that time there were more women than men, and the prophet prophesied that in the future near the end times, a nation’s population would have 50 women for every man because of war. At these times, most people will be non muslims and people will be sinning a lot and being wicked. Because of this, i think its why there would be more women than men.

About the testimonies, women were simply not as engaged in legal matters at the time, especially in the Jahiliya when practically no women were involved. Putting women in a higher number of testimonies does not amount to saying that women are untruthful, it does not mean that women are unintelligent either, it just means that the people judging at the time would not be biased against the women, since this bias would be pretty much balanced by the number of testimonies- it made sure people in court after the death of the prophet (saw) would not just give up on women coming to the court and say that they are untruthful. 


In short, It gave women’s testimonies an actual chance to be chosen over the men’s, since the judges would likely be biased against women because of their involvement on the matters and their misogyny.

Hope i made that clear 


That hadith referring to women’s intelligence is referring to a specific group of people, and doesnt make a generalisation."
533,fopcpug,"First offense thing you should avoid is writing her that she hate being a muslim or she is mistreated or has no rights, Muslim women are considered half the society, as Allah and the prophet pbuh said to treat women with kind and gentleness, heaven lay under mothers feet and a women can make their family go to heaven if they treated them right.
Islam didn't start with the prophet pbub. Islam started with Adam and eve and Allah said he will put a creature that will reproduce and will make things work in his favor, as adam was put on earth after he learned how to sin and seek forgiveness and forgiven Allah promised he will send messengers to teach the religion of Allah, you'd probably heard of few of them like Noah Abraham mosas jesus and finally Mohammad pbut, Allah is the God that has no beginning nor end nor mother nor father nor children or caregiver, hes the king that ever one worship and beg and ask and judged before, he is neither man or women, he's wrath is rockening and his mercy is endless and he chose mercy to over bare everything he created, we believe in angels, in books such as the scripture of Abraham and the Torah of mosas and the psalm of David and the injeel lf jesus and the quran of Mohammed pbut all from God, we believe in the day od judgment and in heaven and hell and to pray and do charitable work and pilgrimage to the house Abraham rebuilt.

be specific, what is happening? good men in pakistan are unable to control themselves from raping women? completely unable to control themselves? i don't see a flood of women complaining about being raped, so are the men all raping themselves?

for what purpose?

yes, millions of unmarried muslim women are doing nothing at all with their lives but making tiktok videos that you don't watch instead of marrying you.

you are wrong here, too. example: the el salvadore civil war ran for over a decade. do yourself a favour and google about rapes during the war, and what eventually stopped it. it certainly wasn't men getting married or having unrape-y sex!

same with several wars in various african countries, central america, other places.

535,fj4i1pn,"Haha.  [Huffpo tells me Muslims are the true feminists](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_9877692). 

&gt;	Islam has a culture and history of women empowerment. In the Qur’an, ..., women and men are described as equals in everyday actions and responsibilities

So when Muslims immigrants increase the say they are feminists. But when a president makes a peace deal and ends a war they are worried about the role of women?

&gt;	Just this one example gives us a view on how true Muslim women are; outspoken, driven, certain and courageous, the epitome of a feminist.

&gt;	These modern women are not afraid to go against the grain in the name of their belief like wearing the hijab

Overall the article is trying to make a good point, but it’s hilarious they use such an oppressive religion to do it. 

Still makes me wonder why the article is worrying about the role of Muslim women if they really are outspoken, courageous, not afraid to go against the grain, and are seen as equals to men. What is the problem?"
536,fe70vfs,"This is again an ignorant statement. Muslim women are excelling in all works of life these days. From administration executives to lawyers to engineers, everywhere. It's just that they don't carry the Label of ""Women Empowerment"" and they dress in a way which makes you think they are ""chained"". They are not. You're the one who needs a change in perspective. And real nice joke about being the 4th wife, you'll rarely find someone marrying even twice simultaneously in Muslim society these days.

And being liberal means making fun and insulting the figures of your religion? You are only liberal if you make fun of Islam? I don't support insulting any religious figure. And I am appalled as to what Christians have made of Jesus Christ. But in Islam, make fun of someone is equivalent to being disrespectful, and Muslims love Mohammad.

As for destruction, go and search how many wars have been fought in the name of Christianity, where as recently as 2003, the consensus in the Bush administration was that they were fighting a religious war in Iraq. Bible does have verses of violence, and if people just want to gloss over that and blame Islam for everything, it's not the Muslim's fault. Nor is it our fault that some politically backed pseudo Islamist organisation has been on a tear in the middle East. And guess who's fighting them? Yeah, Muslims."
537,fepjo6j,"So if Muslim women are displaced from war torn countries to say, France. Do you believe they should stop wearing hijabs/burkas because they need to assimilate to the culture?

For many people you are asking that they change their entire lives, traditions, and almost erase their own mindset when you ask for this. 

The reason why I generally consider this sort of thing racist, is that sure you can say the language, or make vague gestures to what you think the culture of s place is, but usually when people say this it means ""when I look at you I don't want to know you're not from around here"", and that mentality creates so much hatred"
538,f68xff7,"Because the context from the muslim world is very different from that of the western world.

For example Turkey is a predominantly muslim country but women are free to show their hair. Hence, if a Turkish woman wears a hijab, I would agree with you that it is a little strange. It's a way of showing submission to the patriarchy.

However, in Western Europe and North America, muslim women are a relatively small minority. They also happen to be a persecuted minority. Just think of all the hate that someone like Ilhan Omar has to deal with because she has the ""audacity"" to be a Congresswoman who is muslim. Many right-wing people get super angry about that. Also, if you are old enough to have experienced the 1990s like I did, you probably remember how Bush's ""global war on terror"" fundamentally changed the way western people look at muslims. Before they were just another religion, now they are a scapegoat for everything. Many muslim women who grow up in the west struggle with this. On the one hand they love their country (say, the US) but on the other hand they feel how so many of their fellow citizens view them with hate or skepticism. This leads to the question of ""who am I?"" In this emotional turmoil, the hijab turns from a symbol of sexism and patriarchy into a symbol of defiance. Many muslim Europeans and muslim Americans wear it to signify their pride in their heritage. It's comparable to a gay person walking around with a rainbow-colored tshirt. Instead of apologizing for who they are, these women want to say: ""Yes, I am muslim and you know what, I don't give a shit about your prejudices because I'm proud and happy with who I am."" Over the past 15-20 years, the hijab has turned into a symbol that expresses this sentiment strongly but at the same time peacefully."
539,f6kdn5g,"This isn't worthy of it's own post but I just came across this review for a feminist novel called ""The Power"". I have highlighted certain parts with my comments in italics in brackets.

Is it me or is this some misogynistic bullshit?

During the early 21st century, women develop an electrical power that is expelled from their fingers and can be used to shock or kill. As the Power spreads, it ushers in a new religious and political order run by strongwomen, ending with a worldwide war between the sexes. Historical documents from the Cataclysm era interrupt the novel to signal that we are reading about the past. The framework suggests comparison to Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, which is unfortunate because while Alderman's (Disobedience) book won the Bailey's Women's Prize, it fails on multiple levels. There's a flimsy explanation of how women got the Power (from a liquid introduced into water systems during World War II to protect against nerve gas, but then why are only females affected?), and the worldbuilding is just as bad. It turns out that it isn't possible to create a believable world from a pastiche of Facebook feeds and Reddit threads, and **in any case we need some evidence that misogyny is a worldwide problem and not just a personal one** *(Pretty sure misogyny IS a worldwide problem)*. Pre-Power **women's victimization is generalized and in some cases assumed** (Muslim women are oppressed)*(yeah, ALL women are oppressed)*, and however tragic, the backstories crafted for the strongwomen are poorly imagined and serve only to justify war crimes and transnational drug dealing during the revolution. The narrative abounds with **stock characters such as the ambitious woman** *(horrors!)*, the victim, **the misogynist Middle Eastern king** *(OMG so far-fetched)*, and a good guy with a camera, and almost everyone is a background player to Allie and Roxy, the architects of the Cataclysm. There's also hard-charging female politician Margo, a set piece going nowhere. With Margo, we have to fill in the blanks ourselves; **we know she's ambitious, for instance, because she let her husband raise the kids** *(LET her husband raise the kids? WTF?)*. In the end, by focusing on the few and most violent women to make her point, the author ignores the complicated nature of power. Societies fail through the daily capitulation to power and privilege, to self-serving silence and the abdication of individual agency, which is what makes The Handmaid's Tale so powerful and so relevant. Verdict Ripped from the headlines but lacking in verisimilitude, this is a book about power through a narrow lens. Readers will be talking about it, but it is not recommended.

540,ev40tw6,"&gt;ok then you wanna talk about fuckin sexism ? fine coz it goes both ways, why do women who falsely accuse men of rape get out with it so lightly while men get their life destroyed while men who got raped don't get taken seriously ? ""oh it doesn't happen often, it's not the same"" RAPE IS RAPE NO MATTER WHO, 

Ok? Did I ever disagree with this? Did I say anything about rape? Why are you talking about this?

&gt;then maybe i'll tell you a true story: in highschool a girl started making fun of me because my mom worked at my highschool and that i was basically privileged and was using very crude language, my response? a simple: ""fuck off"" ... i got beaten up by a bunch of older dudes that day because i was a boy and i wasn't supposed to talk to girls that way, why is it ok ?

I didn't say it is ok? I've never heard your life story before, so when did I say that that is ok?

&gt;the world is sexist, but not only against women

I never said that it is.

&gt;it's time you learn that and stop complaining when it probably doesn't even invole you

""The world has bad things and we should just let it be bad"" is what you're saying?

&gt;you're just trying to look good on the internet, sad thing really, 'cause at the end of the day the people you're trying to appeal towards probably probably won't notice you and the only ones who remember you are the ones you pissed off. 

Mate, I've been on reddit for like 8 years now, I don't think you understand how many times I've been through the works lmao. I just state my opinion for the sport of it, not for the internet points.

&gt;if you wanna nitpick about sexism ? fine, but do it when the actual world is rid of it

What? Why would you only talk about sexism when it is gone?

&gt;not on the internet where 99% of sexism is immediately shot down when need be

""Don't shut down sexism, because there are people who will shut it down if need be""

Eh? 

Is there some official ""anti-internet-sexism police force"" I'm missing who will do the job of calling out sexism so I don't have to?

&gt;you wanna know what actual sexism is ? young arab girls are sold or ""forced"" into aranged marriages with people that could be twice their age since their young (even before they hit fuckin puberty) did you contribute toward abolishing that ? no you didn't you're too lazy to do that.

If saying ""hey, maybe you shouldn't do that"" on a reddit thread (as I am doing now) could stop those things, then I would do so.

&gt;girls fuckin get raped out in the streets and some people find it in their hearts to say ""she shouldn't have gone out with those clothes if she didn't really want to"" in some countries girls who get raped are forced to marry the one who raped them (as it wasn't traumatic enough already) Did your anti-sexism on the internet and keyboard warriorism contribute against this ? no. 

Ok? What's your point? I'm not single handedly saving the world therefore I should do nothing?

My internet arguments also didn't help find osama bin laden! They didn't end the cold war! They didn't kill the nazis! Oh no I'm such a failure!

&gt;do you even  have anybody you know who suffered from sexism ? and when i say suffered i don't mean ""they got offended by a joke"", probably not, if yes then try to help them instead of doing what you're doing now

Sure, let me just ""go help"" them, I'll go pay them with my ""help dollars"" that circumvent complex social situations to give objective help, brb.

You realize that almost everyone in the Islamic world believes that western women are oppressed.  And that almost everyone in the western world believes that Islamic women are oppressed.  And that’s what the leaders of the respective worlds tell their men to gin up war sentiments.  You never hear “we need to liberate them because of how they mistreat their men”.  It’s *always* women.  The idea that everybody cares about women and that’s what drives men to go to war, but also that “we would never oppress our own women” is just ridiculous.  The reality is that men do not oppress their women.  Anywhere."

544,eo5yqi5,"It’s not the prime motivator at all actually. When we research the prime causes, it’s to assert dominance:

https://www.acesdv.org/about-sexual-domestic-violence/sexual-violence-myths-misconceptions/

Of course this is not a detailed explanation. In my opinion, it has to do with both sexual fulfillment and dominance. 

However, there is no way to say that “provocative” dresses on women cause rape. As we know that rape is pretty common in Muslim countries(and also under-reported), in which such Muslim women are Hijabis/Niqabis as well. 

Also when researchers dwelled into looking into the motives of rapists, we received varying results. For some cases, it really was because of sexual attraction, in some it was dominance, and some it was both. And if we look at what happens abroad in war torn countries, it’s clear that it’s about dominance.

What the problem is is rape culture. This sexual objectification of women is very unhealthy for society. Regardless of the circumstances, the rapist holds full responsibility. The burden cant be put on the victim. A man is required to have self control and not be an animal and start raping every woman he finds sexually attractive. Plus, I have never come across a man that loses his shit over seeing some “sexy” woman wearing provocative clothes. 

I also notice that a lot of these rape incidents have a variety of factors such as drugs, alcohol and locations such as bars/clubs. These are more of a stronger factor for rape than a woman wearing revealing clothing."
545,eooktuz,"#""Either you wear a veil or you get raped.""

Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan to [one of his rape victims](http://archive.is/OKDkH) in 2012.

This is all sanctioned in Islam. It is against Islamic law to rape Muslim women but Allah actually *encouraged* the rape of non-Muslim women (Koran 4:24). 

The Koran tells Muslims four different times that they can keep women captive as rape slaves: Koran 4:24, 8:69, 23:5-6, and 33:50 (see also Abu Dawud 11:2150 and Sahih Muslim 8:3433). Since the Koran tells Muslims they are perpetually at war with non-Muslims (4:101) non-Muslim women are always potential captives."
546,eqpfj96,"Okay lets assume she got married at 6/7.  Its true that the marriage was consumated after she hit puberty but why are you taking the bare minimum of puberty starting at 9? I feel like its to put the prophet more in bad light. Like I said, a year after she was fully married to the prophet. She went to war at which she could only have been to if she was 15 or older. 

Well yeah, muslim men would hope to find virgins because muslim women are supposed to be virgins if they follow their religion except in the case such as the prophet where he married widows to help support them. 

You feel like its easy to accompany virginity to youth. You’re assuming with 100% certainty that muslim men today does in fact accompany virginity to youth (12-17)? Thats pretty arrogant. Thats YOUR assumption and generalisation. 

Side note, muslims today understand that society works differently. Kids dont go to war at 15 or were they breadwinners of their family like back then. Kids mature differently now and thats why child marriage (between 13-16 ) is frowned upon. Society back then worked differently then it is today."
547,elbdcra,"The reality of this nonsense though is that it is really an example of the tyranny of the patriarchy. Whether it's hijab being banned in the West, or here where Muslim women are being forced by ""peer pressure"" to cover up, the singular, common thread here is that it is really about men telling women what they can or cannot do using whatever means within their reach. Wake up people, and see this shit for what it really is. It's actually a gender war. If you don't have two X chromosomes, you don't have a right to decide how the fairer sex dresses up."
548,eluzw99,"Virtually EVERYTHING with white people back then you could argue would have that effect. College, Electricity, Sugar, Chocolate, Cars- literally everything in this country has a history that can be tied to racism and the betterment of white people over non white. It's an assumption to say it's affects were celebrating white women over non white, when white people in general had more rights, etc., it doesn't seem fair when virtually everything back then did. You could just as well say the original poster's effects were women's right to work, which then paved the way towards civil rights, which then paved the way towards intersectionality, etc., it was just a social justice movement. In truth, if you read up about it, you learn that many black women DID get the opportunity to work during WW1, so it seems more likely that this poster did effect all women in a positive way, though still a long way from equal rights. 

The poster wasn't saying that only white women should be working, or that white women are better than women of color- that could have been the  thoughts of some people back then or the person who made the poster, but as you say, it wasn't the intention, because it is not communicated here except for the image of a single white woman, and unless you think the image of a single white woman is white supremacy, then, it doesn't, it's only trying to promote women's right to work. Of course racism was an issue at the time (as it still is), but the movement for women to work was a work in progress to get us to where we are today- it changed the role of women. There were women of all races in the U.S. that had been already working- not just black women, there were just fewer jobs available for women- especially black women. White women weren't all just rich so that they could 'afford' to stay at home- that is an assumption- and that's not why women stayed at home. There were many black women that stayed at home as well. The war opened up MORE jobs for women. Yes, white women obviously had a lot more privileges of course and options. Yes, the original poster was an image of a white woman, taken by a white man. And I understand the intention of this new poster is to challenge that, to say not only white women, but all women, we can do it.  But I think it IS trying to take away from the original poster by shaming it and replacing it- by saying we are done with white supremacy and white women feminism so we are going to take this well known poster with a white woman which came from a time when racism was prevalent that nearly arguably all feminism was white women feminism, and replace it by taking the white woman out entirely, we don't need her anymore even though there was an interesting legend that came out of it that she was someone called Rosie the Riveter and it wasn't about race except for the fact that she was white but was about women- which I do think is ok, except that I don't think it's effective change to shame white people simply for being white, for example, if they had included the original and added new women onto it, it would haven't have possibly sent the wrong message. I'm concerned with making effective change, what is the MOST effective way and I'm not convinced that shaming all previous feminist movements that had white people is necessarily the most effective way to make progressive change, because of what I said earlier about shame/erasure as retaliation. It does have the word 'all' though to correct that, so no one gets confused, and we know it isn't about erasure so I do give it credit for that, though it seems odd and like it's really trying to say, hey white women, we ALL can do it, but pretending to say, let's all join hands, we all can do it, and the bad grammar is cringey though for real. As for what's radical, I used the word in a political context, not in a literal way, as I think you know, and I feel you said that to twist my words against me as though I think muslim women working is radical or something (which, let's be real though, muslim women ARE having to fight hard to work in many countries so that DOES make it radical because it challenges a lot of norms for a lot of people), so it IS kind of radical, or else why make the poster? I don't hate the poster but I think it's kind of clickbaitey for the wrong reasons, in other words."

550,ekgx9nn,"Okay. Do you know what Islam teaches? 

It teaches its followers to subjugate and kill Jews and Christians, homosexuals, apostates, Atheists, polytheists, blasphemers, infidels and anybody who criticises Islam and the Prophet. 

&amp;#x200B;

It teaches that women have half the intelligence of men, that womens' testimonies are worth half as much as mens' are, and that a sister inherits half that her brother does. According to Muhammad, a nation led by a woman will never be successful. The majority of people in hell are women.

&amp;#x200B;

Islam tells us that men are supposed to beat their wives into submission if they're not acting how you want them to. It tells us that it's perfectly okay to marry a nine year old girl, (not just okay, a child is actually the best wife in Islam). Muslim women are allowed to marry one man, and that man has to be Muslim. Muslim men are allowed to marry 4 wives and women of any faith. According to Islam, you're not just allowed to beat your wife into submission so hard her skin turns green, if you want to have sex with her, she can't have any say in the matter - consent isn't a thing. FGM is supported, men are allowed to have sex with married female captives and slaves, women aren't, a veil / hijab is compulsory. *But oh, Islam is so empowering for women*.

&amp;#x200B;

The Prophet Muhammad was a white man who owned black slaves, he likened Ethiopians (black people) to ""raisin heads"" and said that a black slave is worth half that of a white one. He also said that the worst possible leader is one of a slave whose head is black and looks like a raisin (alternatively, a black slave with missing limbs). When one of Muhammad's black slaves were killed, he said that man wouldn't go to heaven as he had taken a cloak before the spoils of war were divided. According to Muhammad, satan looks like a black guy (Ibn Ishaq P.243).

•North Koreans oppressed South Koreans

• black people in Chicago oppress other black people killing them off 

• Racially-motivated attacks constantly occur on Pygmies including rape and cannibalization.

It seems that every group has been racist or oppressed another group. So then I’m confused here none of these acts were by white people and by other people so then by your logic no one should get a month?

553,eedcq4e,"They seem to think the whole country has been cucked.  Basically they hate Sweden because it's the rape *reporting* capital of the world, and the migrants Sweden allowed in are rapidly assimilating - which is counter to their whole narrative.  The more intelligent of their movement understand that, which is why there is concentrated propaganda effort to represent Sweden like its the exact opposite, which most people believe.

They seem to think, and the propaganda implies, Sweden is allowing the migrants to rape the Swedish women, and that there is war zone level violence in Malmo.

The reality is that what constitutes rape in Sweden under the law there is very strict, and Muslim women are reporting it.  The evidence suggests Muslim women are quickly assimilating and gaining independence from the more patriarchal culture of Islam, so what was once never considered rape to them, is now, and the Muslim women are reporting it.  The Swedish judicial system is being lenient on the men because they understand its a cultural change and rather than ruining vast swaths of men's lives they are giving them probation.

So basically Sweden is doing what Sweden is famous for at this point.  Being rationally and emotionally intelligent.  But the propagandists on the right are taking advantage of that, and portraying those decisions as ""Muslims gangrape white lady and gets probation, Sweden is cucked, also grenades.""

554,eg75pox,"&gt;The issue has not changed, the root injustice cannot be denied. The problem is fatigue and the Islamisation of the Palestinian cause.

So what are people's solution? That we 'kick out' the Jews from the area? That's obviously impossible. The constant hate that Israel gets shows that its critics don't care for a two state solution, they want Israel wiped off the map. Not gonna happen for obvious reasons.

As for this: 

This was partly done by the Israeli state, who deliberately funded Hamas as a divisive force to weaken the PLO, back in the '70s.

This may be an interesting point to some but the truth of the matter is that Muslim hatred for Jews predates whatever bad dealings Israel may have done. The same goes those who think that America is the root cause of Islamic jihadism when Islamic hatred of the West far predates the West's war on terror. Islamist jihadism was on the rise way before whatever Reagan was doing in Afghanistan.

&gt;Pakistan and the Muslim presence in South Asia is a direct resultof genocide - the largest ever documented in history - and identity shift towards the conquering group.

Right. So it staggers my mind that this vile country can give lectures about Israel for example, when whatever Israel's done is miniscule, literally a speck in the water compared to the amount of people who have been wiped out since the carving of Porkistan from India and the subsequent Bangladesh genocide amongst many other atrocities in the region.

&gt;Much of Europe had to deal with the savagery of MENA piracy, invasion and genocides... It's just what humans do. Especially Middle Eastern/Central Asian groups.

Hence the savagery of their communities despite living in the West for decades. Inbreeding and following a barbaric radical ideology. I would hate to grow up in those communities and come to the realisation that your entire heritage is based on barbarism. The only way to salvage your soul is to leave your family and fully embrace secularism and Western values.

&gt;Isrealis just happen to be superior to all the other Middle Eastern peoples.

Yeah. They're a wise, high IQ population. What have Arabs, who dominate the Middle East region in wealth and numbers done with all the oil they discovered oil? Utterly nothing when it comes to building a civilisation. Everyone knows their shiny buildings are built on Islamic barbarism and the hatred of secular, democratic values. Their women are defeated objects. They're a joke. Ben Shapiro said it best that Arab like to destroy things whereas Israelis like to build things.

&gt;Imo, the best answer for Palestinians is to convert to Judaism and inter-marry with them. This will destroy their genetic advantage and muddle-up the underlying racial politics. Also, Isreali chicks are hot ;).

Israelis have it all to lose if they were to breed with such a challenged and in many ways, defeated population. Israelies breeding with Europe or East Asians, fine. But the mainstream Arab population is a joke. And yeah, Israeli chicks are indeed hot. Bar Rafaeili for example is just physical perfection. What's the image that your average person would have of an Arab woman in comparison? An abused, defeated looking woman covered in a medieval garbage bag. Whatever Arab beauties there may be would be rare to find and then you'd have to hope that her beauty remains intact (which you could happily bet against when Islam hates the female form and the cases of honour violence regarding Muslim women are numerous in number)."
555,edj205a,"&gt;The figures showed that most of the suspected crimes were by repeat offenders, and that 1 percent of migrants accounted for 40 percent of total migrant crimes.

edit: To those who downvoted me, go study Islam and research what Muslim immigrants are doing in Europe. I've heard quite a bit from people who regularly visit cities with large amounts of immigrants and I've yet to hear a single positive thing about them. Islam is not compatible with the civilized world and nothing will change that. ""Nice Muslime"" are never real hardcore Muslims.

556,e5my62p,"It is really heart warming to read: you obviously have the ability to search for answers inside (internal solutions) rather than outside (external solutions). The former is the product of a conscious being, the latter an unconscious one. I'm glad you were able to see through the deception of Islam.

Though I was never a believer, I took a private interest to learning Hebrew and reading the first book of Moses because I started to take notice myself that the planet is descending into a religious war which essentially involves Islam (believer) vs. everything else (unbeliever). I have spent a great deal of time carefully looking at the Qur'an and holding it to the scrutiny of the Hebrew (original) books of Moses, and Islam is essentially one giant heresy of epic proportions.

Muhammad is an idol: idolatry is based on creating a psychological attachment to an impression or image. Muhammad's 'sunnah' or 'pattern of conduct' is just precisely this: a one-size-fits-all pattern that serves as the backbone of the empire. This applies to Jesus/Christianity as well. The biblical Moses forbid idolatry, along with bearing of false testimony, which the shahada is owing to a testimony of a dead / non-existent man which leads to the adoption of idol-based cults. There is little to no evidence that such figures even existed; much less did/said what they are purported to do (according to the empire itself) which requires a testimony of in order to join the cult.

The Qur'an is highly problematic: it contains many errors, foreign words that make no sense in Arabic unless converted back into Syro-Aramaic (Christian heretical writings) and is most certainly not of divine origin. 

Islam is most definitely institutionalized ignorance: this is not to say Muslims in general are inferior people as Muslims have some of the most powerful hearts on the planet, it's just that this powerful energy is polarized in the negative manner by Islam that would otherwise be bursting with beauty, especially in the Muslim women.

The problem is Muslim women are exceeding degraded and degenerated in Islam. Moses used the term 'Elohim' to denote the primordial creator of the heavens and earth. This term is a balanced relationship between man (gods) and woman (goddesses). Whoever Muhammad was (if he existed) has terribly, terribly upset this balance such that women were literally degraded into property and sources of sexual pleasure for the mujahideen.

As a fellow unbeliever, I can only say I do hope that this same Elohim (if it is true Moses received the ten commandments from it/them) then if it were to enforce the ten commandments as they were delivered to Moses, Islam would immediately fall and the people will be free. We have to understand there is a tremendous, tremendous amount of unspoken of suffering within Islam."
557,e3up05y,"The Leftie rag known as the Mirror, although can be slightly forgiven for providing the excellent Andy Capp strip, amplifying Baroness Warsi *predictions of doom befalling her people*.

Really know how to paint a picture of such a tolerant and accepting faith... just wow.

Rehashes a bit from the outrage industry's media circuit of the palaver, copied below to save you the click:

&gt;Boris Johnson’s “gratuitously offensive” and “racist” remarks about Muslims could spark a race war, two top Tories have suggested.

&gt;Describing women in burkas as “letter boxes” and “bank robbers” will lead to “attacks on our streets”, Baroness Warsi, ex-chair of the Tory party, said.

&gt;Mr Johnson’s comments will “encourage bigotry” and “cause problems with race relations”, Lord Sheikh, president of the Conservative Muslim Forum, added.

&gt;Pressure was mounting last night on the former Foreign Secretary to back down over his controversial comments as at least 15 senior Tory figures demanded he apologise.

&gt;Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright and Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Tories, were among the new figures warning his remarks had crossed a line.

&gt;Mr Johnson, who is on holiday abroad, has not been seen in public since his inflammatory article on Monday.

&gt;A source close to him has made clear that he stood by the article in which he argued against a burka ban brought in by some European countries.

&gt;But former cabinet minister and ex-Tory party chair Lord Pickles warned that Mr Johnson could face disciplinary action unless he was prepared to back down.

&gt;He said: “You can’t defend liberal ideas by using illiberal language.

&gt;He added that the party has “various procedures” if an official complaint were made, although he said it would be “a very big leap” to suggest that could lead to his expulsion.

&gt;However, he added: “You never know how these things develop.”

&gt;Meanwhile, the president of the Conservative Muslim Forum, Lord Sheikh, demanded Mr Johnson be booted out of the party, stepping up his demands for the Conservative whip to be withdrawn from Mr Johnson.

&gt;He said he had written to party chair Brandon Lewis calling for “severe action” over the “inflammatory” remarks.

&gt;He said: “I think to a certain extent they’re racist. In a way it is racist. These words are very inflammatory.

&gt;“I believe they will cause problems with race relations. I believe it will encourage bigotry in this country.”

&gt;Ex-Tory party chair Baroness Warsi warned Mr Johnson’s remarks could trigger a rise in hate crime.

&gt;She accused Mr Johnson of using rightwing, “alt-right” language in criticising the appearance of the burqa, which contributes to a view that “Muslim women are fair game”.

&gt;Baroness Warsi said: “I refuse to accept that these phrases were some kind of mistake, and the offence inadvertent - Johnson is too intelligent and too calculating for that. No, this was all quite deliberate. His refusal to apologise supports that.

&gt;“He set out a liberal position, but he did it in a very alt-right way. This allowed him to dog-whistle: to say to particular elements of the party that he’s tough on Muslims. Yet again, he’s trying to have his cake and eat it.”

&gt;message that Muslim women are fair game.

&gt;“What starts as useful targets for ‘colourful political language’ and the odd bit of toxic campaigning ends up in attacks on our streets.”

&gt;Mr Johnson has defied Theresa May by refusing to apologise for his remarks.

&gt;Culture Secretary Mr Wright said that while it was important issues like the wearing of burka were discussed publicly, politicians had to choose their language with care.

&gt;He added: “When you are discussing a subject such as this, then I think describing it as people looking like letterboxes isn’t helpful.

&gt;Mr Wright said there was no reason not to have a “robust conversation” about the subject, but added: “We’re not talking to our friends in the pub. We are public figures and we have an additional obligation to be careful.”

&gt;Scottish Tory leader Ms Davidson went further, saying Mr Johnson’s comments had been “gratuitously offensive” and that he needed to apologise.

&gt;She added: “I think that this wasn’t an off-the-cuff slip, he wrote a column, he knew exactly what he was doing and I think it crossed from being provocative and starting a debate and actually it became rude and gratuitous.”

&gt;Meanwhile, ex Attorney General Dominic Grieve said Mr Johnson’s comments were “very embarrassing” and warned he would quit the party if he ever became leader.

&gt;Mr Grieve added: “I don’t regard him as a fit and proper person to lead a political party and certainly not the Conservative Party.

&gt;“He is somebody who seems to me to pursue an agenda that is entirely self-referential.”

&gt;A source close to Mr Johnson has said it is “ridiculous” his views were being “attacked”.

&gt;Separately, a Sky News poll found a majority of the British public do not think Mr Johnson’s remarks are racist and are split on whether he should apologise.

&gt;According to the Tory party’s code of conduct, members should not use their position to “bully, abuse, victimise, harass or unlawfully discriminate against others”, with the prospect of suspension or expulsion for those found to be in breach.

&gt;Meanwhile, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage urged Mr Johnson to stick to his guns, saying he should “stand firm” and not apologise.

&gt;Tory party chair Lewis revealed on Tuesday that he had asked Mr Johnson to apologise, with Mrs May joining him later that day.

&gt;The PM said the remarks - contained in Mr Johnson’s weekly Daily Telegraph column - had “clearly caused offence”.

&gt;In the piece, Mr Johnson argued against Denmark banning the burka.

&gt;But he made several comparisons between the covering worn by some women, saying it made them look like “bank robbers” or “letter boxes”.

&gt;Mr Johnson also revealed he would “feel entitled” to ask a woman wearing the burka to remove it if she came to his constituency office.

558,e40mjzo,"Normally just lurking. But here I have to interject.

&gt;Tbh, I’m getting a bit pissed off about white non-Muslims rushing to  ‘liberate’ our Muslim sisters. We need to listen to them and their  stories, rather than telling them what they should believe.

What does that even mean in practice? Muslim women are not one monolithic block but are divided along cultural-political battle lines. So who should we listen to? To everyone or to those women who share political goals with us? Are we not allowed to express solidarity along political lines?

What about the US then? As a very secular European, I am constantly baffled when it comes to religious fundamentalists and their war on women in the US. And of course, there are quite a few women among those fundamentalists (who were very aptly described by Dworkin in ""Right-Wing Women""). So, whose voices am I required to listen to here, given that this is not exactly my culture? Do I need to give equal weight to women favoring ""European"" conceptions of feminism and women who do the bidding of the fundamentalists? Do I need to listen to fucking Phyllis Schlafly now?

By the way: El-Saadawi was always quite unambigous in her critique of the veil. "
559,e4fiupv,"You're clearly dealing with a religious girl who is trying to ease you into submission. Submission to her desire, means a submission to Islam, immediate, or eventual... now, or later. If you do not wish to convert to Islam (as I do not, and I have made clear to all of my MENA/Muslim, past and present women), be firm and tell her that.

You lust for each other - you may even have a crush on each other - but her religion clearly defines you as unholy, unworthy and unclean. You are not circumcised. How will she have sex with you?

In Christianity, marriage is between a baptized man and a baptized woman. In Islam, it is between a Muslim man and a Kittabi woman. In neither religion is what you have considered a ""marriage"", it is zinah in Islam and adultery in Christianity.

Your girl is either confused, or has a hidden agenda. Having dealt with similar situations plenty of times, I am inclined to lean on the latter.

Her father isn't religious, how much of a role does her brother play? Does he consider what you have as unholy, haram? Has he ever commented on it? If not, he is either:

* not as religious as you think
* doesn't care about his sister (unlikely, knowing Arabs/Muslims)
* isn't aware of your arrangement, or;
* expects her to be able to convince you to join Islam

Arab/Muslim women are quite the forbidden, delicious fruit. There's a reason why there aren't many white men marrying them and walking up and down European high streets with baby-strollers full of beautiful, golden skinned mixed race children. For over a hundred years, Brits have married Indians, Frenchmen have taken subsaharan black African wives, but for one reason or another, white males have not been marrying North Africans/Levantines en masse.

Food for thought.

Edit:

&gt;She wants to marry in Algeria, and only if i convert (or fake to) to islam. We both live in europe

Holy fucking fuck. I missed this part. You both live in Europe, are residents in Europe and have no intention of living in Algeria - right? So why on earth would you go through the hassle of getting a visa to Algeria, collecting documents proving that you are not already married/have not exceeded the 4 wives limit, notarizing and translating them into Arabic, converting to Islam and dealing with shit tests from her family --- ***unless*** if it were for her family to give her their feedback of you or try and bend you under the umbrella of Islam?

I've advised couples where one of the spouses was Algerian to get married in a neutral, non-Islamic country (by law) like Turkey or Ukraine for there to be less paperwork, costs and procedures and here you are going through pointless headaches.

No, my dude. Get into a civil partnership in Europe (wherever you live) and make that the end of it.

&gt;her brother is very religious. They don’t know our relationship  
&gt;  
&gt;maybe algerian guys could be jealous

If you live in a shitty part of Europe where the opinion of some Algerian (probably illegal) migrants determines whether you are safe or not to leave the house, you need to improve your living conditions and move to a better part of the world. It's what I did when I left London for Tunisia. Good luck to anyone who tries to give me shit here.

&gt;It will be safe for me to marry in Algeria

Forget this option altogether. It's not an option for you. Stay where you are, how you are. Improve, not worsen, your current conditions.

&gt;a beautiful muslim girl

People of non-typically-Muslim backgrounds can be beautiful and be converts to Islam. Be precise: you mean North African/Arab woman.

It is safe to marry anyone, assuming you are genuinely a Muslim, and to live in Algeria as a Muslim. Beautiful women will get more attention, and unfortunately, as a general percentage of the population, most men will not react in the same way that a European man would upon coming into contact with an attractive member of the opposite sex.

&gt;while it's clear i'm a non-muslim foreigner

In a post about how Algerians see multi-confessional marriages [(here)](http://www.reddit.com/r/algeria/comments/956oay/how_do_algerian_see_multiconfessional_mariage/), user /u/[Toastb4Roast](https://www.reddit.com/user/Toastb4Roast) wrote:

&gt;It doesn't matter what the people of Algeria think bro. When my wife and I got married tons of people told her she made a mistake and married a kufar (despite me being muslim so really they were just racists because I'm American).  
&gt;  
&gt;I've got European ancestry so perhaps they assume I'm not Muslim but it happened a LOT.  
&gt;  
&gt;People would add her on Facebook just to tell my wife she married a kufar. Then theyd hit on her themselves. It was pretty disgusting but we just blocked them and moved on with our lives.  
&gt;  
&gt;One niqabi girl at my wifes school said this to her and then a few months later went on to marry a non Muslim french guy. I guess she doesn't care what the Quran says about the hypocrits.

Why would you put yourself at the mercy of what some people from a nation you, I would assume, don't want to have any connections with other than your future (potential) wife's father being born there? If her grandparents exerted pressure on her father to have you two separated, would you be fine with the heartbreak?

&gt;She probably think i could became muslim over time

Yeah... no, walk away.

&gt;i’m atheist and it will never happen

Are you ready to fake-pray 5 times a day? Instead of watching your favorite series, you'll get called down to the mosque every Friday until you die? Do you have a lot of free time? Are you alright with shortening parts of your body?

&gt;Do you know any muslim/atheist marriage?

I don't know of any (anything other than Muslim)-Muslim marriage. My aunt, a Ukrainian, married an Algerian. Didn't work out. She became Muslim, he became abusive, she left him and proceeded to leave Islam. I'm a Christian, I want the best - the truth - for the my children and their mother. Do you want someone by your side - until you die - who believes in something you deem to be irrational, impossible and untrue?

Arab women are irresistible, delicious, yummy, amazing mothers and awesome soul mates. Find one who worships the same (or no) God as you. 45% of Lebanon is Christian and a huge portion of teens who grew up in the Syrian civil war are questioning the existence and mercy of God - there are plenty in Europe to chose from."
560,e4gb49f,"
&gt;Not the point , you can still be a hindu,jain etc while being gay and it doesn't matter for the community.

If you look at it like that then you can be a gay Muslim, no problem. In Islam your faith is a very personal topic, you don't have to stick to a society's norm to be deemed worthy by God. There are lots of misconception about Islam mainly among Muslims themselves. Because they don't read and understand the Quran themselves, rather they depend on others to do it for them. That's gives people an opportunity to push their narrative of Islam on to others.

&gt;You don't have to have to follow the vedas to be hindu and jains and buddhist reject it . Also I don't remember any verse like this , care to link me?

Vedas are considered to be religious text aren't they. Fine, you reject Vedas like I reject hadiths. I haven't read all religious books, but since there is a ceremony in Hindu culture for marriage I can guarantee you there will line or verse which says marriage can only happen between opposite sexes. Also it would clearly stipulate what roles each of them have under marriage. It's the way these religious books or texts are written. 


&gt;I am saying this by looking at saudi arabia,uae,iran,iraq,pakistan and the horrible treatment of women

In South India there are a lots of local Gods and goddesses, like mookambika etc. North Indian Hindu don't identify with them, so are South Indian Hindus not Hindus? 
Traditions vary with region, Pakistan wanted to imitate the Suads so they built a shitty nation for women. 

UAE? Really? Can you tell me what horrible treatment is done by the UAE govt towards women. 

As for Iran and Iraq? Did you know about the Iran and Iraq pre gulf war? They were countries like turkey of today. The people how are in power now changed all that to fit their narrative. And it's unfortunate. 


&gt;Go to Europe and you have the same problem with the islamic communities . The same is true for africa and india 
I say this by looking at the sexist phrases of the quran 

Let me be very clear, just because women wear hijab doesn't mean they are oppressed. I know many women who defend hijab (I personally think it's an outdated fashion statement), so if hijab is the attire of their choice they should have to freedom to wear it. 
Also just because few countries allow women to wear bikinis, doesn't mean they are not oppressed. 

Do you think only Indian Muslim women are oppressed? That the oppression is only religious oppression? 

I am not claiming that Muslim women are not oppressed, but Islam doesn't ask to oppress women. Instead it gives them all sort of right that other religions didn't. In many matters Islamic law were the trailblazers in liberation of women. Just give you one example, mehar- is the dowry given by men to guarantee that they will be taken care of and the men cannot lay claim to this mehar. Women are given the right to divorce their husbands if they are away for more than 6 months and they don't even have to give any reasons. Regarding polgamy ( which I don't support ), men can't have multiple if their existing wife doesn't agree, yes that's a condition among many other.

Sadly the Islam we know of today is more infamous for all the wrong reasons.


&gt;I say this by looking at the sexist phrases of the quran 

There are many verses in Qur'an which today considered sexist today. But why paint Islam with a different brush when all religious texts are sexist. 

I reject all organized religion for the same reason. Because all religion are sexist. Can a Hindu women become a priest? Can a Christian woman become the pope? Can a Muslim women become a Muslim priest? Answer to all these questions, no.


&gt;Thats not what whataboutism is at all

Honestly, if it's not whataboutism then I don't know what is.


"
561,e13hrm5,"I really recommend people to check the history of colonial era and the Cold War to deal with the social problem in Muslim majority countries. Don’t blame the oppressed for being oppressed. Can’t say people in Muslim majority countries take no responsibility, but they weren’t given much choice from the beginning. 

Bearing more children while being poor is not right but reasonable, since the lower opportunity cost for poor people to raise children, their psychological need, and their insecure about life after growing old. 

Contrary to many Western beliefs, actually Islam is far from the biggest reason of women’s education and fertility rate. A recent study just showed that the education of Muslim women is directly linked to the economic condition of their countries. Women in UAE and Qatar are very educated and financially independent. Muslim women are some of the most educated group in America, better than their male counterparts and women of other religious group. Despite of similar culture, women in Iran is far more educated and has much less children than those in Afghanistan. Average fertility rate drop dramatically from 6 to 3 in Iran during 1987-1997, when the country was developed greatly economically and women’s literacy rate rose from 40% to 65%. Iran has the fastest speed of dropping fertility rate than any other country in modern history.  (Let alone China’s one child policy) It’s clear that the economic reason is a much bigger reason than religion or culture. Same patterns apply to any other countries like Mexico, that after the economic growth the fertility rate drastically dropped. 

Due to colonialism, Cold War and Global Trade in the past over 100 years, as long as those so-called Third World country are still weak in today’s global economy, the women in those country are not going to get rid of the status quo any soon.

(Interesting though, that the Muslim world got some brilliant female figure through out their history, and it’s also directly linked to the economic situation of the time. Although contemporary standard may not always suitable for evaluating women’s living in pre-modern time, Muslim women enjoyed higher social status and more finical success than European women at those time.)

Please check each year’s UN report on fertility rate. Trying to lower the fertility rate is expensive. It need a lot of investment to solve the poverty problem. We enjoyed a fairly success in the past years, and fertility rate is dropping constantly globally. As long as the economic situation is well, everything will go on well."
562,dzkai0y,"All non-islamic women are their property and ""spoils of war"" (even if they didn't win anything and just got let in because of the kindness of the host)"
563,e0ab11t,"There seems to be this idea in western countries that the biggest oppression that women face is being forced to wear a hijab or niqab. This already parts from the idea that muslim women are by default ""forced"" into wearing them and that they have no agency regarding how they want to present themselves to the world. I live in Latin America and I have met a lot of people that cannot simply understand that a woman might want or like to wear the hijab or niqab, it simply doesn't add up in their heads.

In this same train of ideas, there is this perception that the worst problem that Muslim women face is the hijab, no one talks of domestic violence, poverty, lack of education, war, access to healthcare and so on. My theory on this is that it is simply much easier to blame some pieces of fabric than to face the fact that human are facing terrible realities like war, human trafficking or starvation."
564,e0u484u,"Deport whom? Why bring in deportation? Seems like someone is trying too hard. I thought we were talking about how hijabs are oppressive.

I mentioned I was brown because the color of one's skin seems to matter to you sjw racists, as implied by your first question.

Good for your wife she has the freedom to wear her hijab. Do the women of Iran and Saudi Arabia have the freedom to not wear it? Do many daughters of muslim immigrants have that freedom? There is no societal or physical threats from many muslim families, for their daughters to conform? (Rhetorical question, answer is obvious)

And why quote books? Reality, and what happens in practice matters. Muslims enforce these oppressive coverings and punish women for not complying, much more than other faiths. 

In the minds of Islamo-Fascists, up is down, war is peace, freedom is slavery and hijab culture is not oppressive.

Ans what is this about niqabs? The niqab is not compulsory in Saudi you absolute twit 🤣🤣🤣 - armchair sjw can't even do a google search.

566,dwoqhyo,".1. I am quoting the koran, Mohammed beheads 600 jews. YES, muslim friends I have tell me that in pakistan they sing songs about killing jews. Here is uk schools https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN3eKN-ybG8&amp;t=5
You know what you just said is a lie. 

.2. If you have no heard of putting non-believers to the sword, you haven't read the koran. I can't put it simpler than that.
Quran 9:5
Quran 2:191, 193
Quran 9:5
Quran 49:9

""And slay them [non believers] wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter... and fight them until fitnah is no more, and religion is for Allah.

.3. Muslim women are subservient so if you do it, you do it. I know men who have multiple wives. 
The first told me his first wife was very scared when he took her virginity and she couldn't satisfy him in bed, so he got a new wife. They did have a child, but he kidnapped the little girl and sent her to live hidden with his extended family in Yemen while he lived in the West, so that was 'good'. 
Technically he had a temporary marriage too (that is where you kidnap women and girls from war and keep them in pits around the pakistani / afghan border, and then you get a dodgy imam to temporarily marry you for an hour or a day to the rape-slave so that god doesn't mind, because you are raping a captive woman who you are married to. So he had at least 3 wives.)

Why cant women have multiple husbands? (Obviously it is because women are second class dirt, but I know you can't admit this so I'm curious what you'll respond).

.4. Yes, it is a bit schizophrenic. It says christians, jews and muslims are equivalent and can all go to heaven, is this the cow? and their foods are all halal. But it undeniably talks about killing jews and killing kuffars, putting them to the sword, taking their women 'in your right hand' and tells you not to spend time around them - it also says these aggressive verses replace the earlier nicer ones. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwtSt1XrVMk

.5. Quran (4:89) - ""If they turn back (from Islam), take (hold) of them and kill them wherever you find them, and take neither Auliya' (protectors or friends) nor helpers from them."" - so, wrong again, it directly tells you to kill leavers. This isn't a fringe opinion, everyone knows it and it's very commonly quoted.

What you just said is really dark, you obviously know that killing is justified in islam and you justify it in your own way, but also half-pretend it's not true. You need to get beyond 'enemies' and bronze age war, and stupid men with swords and grow up.

Bullshit is a foolish word to use for a proven liar. Tell me which of those points is bullshit."
567,dvu9bkb,"War of the wombs. While the west teaches its women to focus on careers. Islamic women are told to create and raise the next generations of people that automatically share their ideals by being raised Muslim. 

Staying home and raising the next generation to further your goals may be the single most important job there is. And women in the west are actively being ridiculed for doing it. Our birth rate is very low."
568,dvh7ny2,"The Supreme Court’s decision in the Akhila/Hadiya case, that courts cannot go into the “reasonableness” of an individual’s choice of marriage partner, is nothing more than a restatement of a Constitutional principle. In the immediate case, Akhila gets to live with her “chosen” husband, Shafin Jahan, a marriage that was annulled by the Kerala High Court on grounds that she may have been unduly influenced in her decision.

For Hindu (and some church) groups that see love jihad in marriages that result in a conversion to Islam, this should be a wake-up call on two fronts: one, chasing the lovejihad angle will – even if there is occasional vindication – just as frequently lead to embarrassing defeats in courts; and, two, refusing to separate what is visible on the surface from the subterranean asymmetries that drive conversions will prevent them from truly understanding what is happening on the ground and take remedial measures.

We need to be clear on two more issues: love jihad, even if it exists, will remain the pursuit of a Muslim fringe, not the mainstream. It is the mainstream approach of “moderate Islam” to such unions that one needs to worry about. Failure to understand this aspect of mainstream Islam can result in further adverse changes to Hindu demography in states like Kerala, Assam, and Jammu and Kashmir. Shouting hoarse about fringe groups which try to practise a patriarchal form of love jihad amounts to chasing a red herring.

“Love jihad”, to the extent that it exists, is narrowly defined as Muslim men ensnaring Hindu (or Christian) women – and no idea can be more patriarchal than this. If Muslims seriously were into love jihad, they would try conversions the other way around: set up women to snare men from other faiths. This is more feasible given the evolutionary reality that women are, on average, selective than men when choosing mates, and logically it should be easier to attract men and then seek to convert them than the other way around. That this isn’t quite the case shows that love jihad is not what it is made out to be. The time to worry about love jihad is when scores of Muslim women are pushed into the game, but I am willing to bet that Muslim women will be smart, and refuse to sacrifice their relationships just because some jihadigroups demand it.

Another point worth making is that adolescent defiance of parents is to be expected sometimes, since our children react to how they see us as parents. If Akhila’s father was an atheist, and, possibly, an authoritarian figure in her life, one can almost see her do something to hurt him by her actions. Remember, one of Gandhi’s sons became a Muslim, hurting Gandhi no end.

At the other end of the spectrum, a liberal and tolerant parent may also end up with the same result, since some children need more guidance and firm handling, and the lack of ideological or religious mooring may be disorienting to them. Once again, they may choose to find an answer in a totalitarian religion. The short point is that there can be many reasons why some (a microscopic minority) of our children, despite authoritarian or tolerant upbringing, find something else attractive, if only for a while.

So, the first truth we need to internalise is that conversions like that of Akhila are unavoidable on the margins. You can never know which individual will find what idea attractive for what personal, pathological reason. If a Bhagat Singh can, in his early 20s, be infatuated with a totalitarian ideology like Leninism, why is it unusual for an Akhila to be attracted to another form of totalitarianism like Islam? It is only her life’s experience with Shafin Jahan that may convince her that she may have made a mistake.

If Hindu organisations thus raise love jihadto a war cry, they are likely to face defeat. Worse, it is a needless distraction, something that prevents us from understanding the wider problem with Islam, and what needs to be done to inoculate ourselves and our children from it. To come to grips with the issue, we need to understand mainstream Islam, and not only the fringe that may want to join Islamic State.

Starting with the basics, both Christianity and Islam deem conversion as core to their faith. If you are Christian or Muslim, it is part of your duty to get others into the fold. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an Islamic apostate and liberal thinker, in her monograph on The Challenge of Dawa, says that “the term ‘dawa’ refers to activities carried out by Islamists to win adherents and enlist them in a campaign to impose sharia law on all societies. Dawa is not the Islamic equivalent of religious proselytising, although it is often disguised as such by blending humanitarian activities with subversive political activities… Dawa as practiced by radical Islamists employs a wide range of mechanisms to advance their goal of imposing Islamic law (sharia) on society. This includes proselytising but extends beyond that. In Western countries, dawa aims both to convert non-Muslims to political Islam and to instill Islamist views in existing Muslims. The ultimate goal of dawa is to destroy the political institutions of a free society and replace them with the rule of sharia law.”

We don’t need to take such a drastic view of Indian Islam, but, at the same time, we need to understand why Islam has been so successful in expanding its demographic through normal inter-marriages. Once critical mass is reached in terms of numbers, the radicals can then ensure Islamic dominance in a geography.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb, in his latest book,Skin In The Game, talks about life’s asymmetries and how the most intolerant tend to win. It takes only a small minority of uncompromising people to make its preferences dominant, as long as the majority is not unduly inconvenienced by acquiescing. He gives the example of halal meat; Muslims won’t eat non-halal meat, but non-Muslims don’t have objections to it. So, halal meat dominates even if the Muslim community in a country is just 2-3 per cent of the overall population.

Taleb gives the example of Islam and its spread throughout the Middle East, even though Christianity was the dominant religion before the seventh century. Islam benefited from two asymmetries: one, when a non-Muslim man marries a Muslim woman, he has to convert. And the progeny of any inter-faith couple is automatically Muslim in Islamic law. The second asymmetry is intolerance – Islam is a one-way street. All are free to enter, but none can exit, with apostasy being the worst crime in Islam.

With reference to Egypt, Taleb points out how these two asymmetries reduced the Coptic majority to a minority after centuries of inter-marriage. Women who retained their faith after marrying Muslims found their children were Muslim by birth. In the reverse case, of a non-Muslim marrying a Muslim, conversion is compulsory or the marriage is illegal.

It is this asymmetric process, rather than love jihad, that is at work. Islam is both the world’s most patriarchal religion, and also the most keen to covert. It is the slow accretion of Muslim numbers through marriage and the Islamic concept of dawa – which expects Muslims to spread the faith by any means – that result in a big challenge to Hinduism. Christianity can handle this better than Hinduism, for Christianity follows the same idea as Islam in its approach to conversion. All it has given up is violence and extreme coercion to ensure conversion.

I recall a story told to me by a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) member, whose day job was working for an Indian company. At the end of a US trip on business, his American (Christian) business partner suddenly popped the question: “You are a good man; why don’t you become a Christian?” (These are not the exact words, but give you a sense of what was asked). The RSS guy apparently told him he was Hindu, to which the American sheepishly replied that his church expected him to expand the faith, and there was no harm in trying. How many Hindus, even when given the opening, will even try to convert others to Hinduism?

The Hindu vulnerability comes from the fact that we don’t indoctrinate (and rightly so) our children as much as Islam or Christianity. We are expected to accept all forms of faith, even non-faith or atheism. This makes it easier for us to accept our partners’ Islamic or Christian faiths, when the reverse is not true. Our partners from Abrahamic religions may never accept Hinduism as equally valid even if they truly love us for what we are. The demographic shift is thus always one way.

Our caste structure and our inability to think strategically on how to retain our numbers and deal with aggressive, expansionist faiths on their own terms is costing us dearly. We need to think more creatively about how to meet the Christo-Islamic challenge than just crying love jihad.

569,dtmxemw,"&gt; Oh really, so they have a choice in Saudi Arabia? A lot of Muslim countries are bastions of progressive ideas huh? 

Because Saudi Arabia is a representation of all 1.6 billion Muslims world wide. /s

&gt; Islam is very clear on this stuff, so if you studied it more you'd know. Go listen to some of Ayan Hirsi Ali's speeches.

Hahahahaha. Ayan Hirsi Ali has come out as a liar. She's using gullible idiots like yourself for money and fame. She lied to Dutch authorities about her name, age and about fleeing civil war in Somalia. She was part of the elite, she lived a comfortable life in Kenya, she never experienced war. She also lied about escaping from a forced marriage. She lied about a potential honour killing because she ""left"" her husband. She visited her family after getting asylum, even her former husband.

She claims muslim women are ""held captive"" and are like ""frightened birds trapped in cages"". Despite the fact that her muslim mum worked for a British women and travelled to many countries...

She made false claims claming Muslims are responsible for 70% of world violence citing the International Institute for Strategic Studies. When the institute was asked to confirm this, they revealed that such a figure had never been stated. She even praised Anders Behring Breivik, Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller.

A Dutch TV program did a show here they exposed her lies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho3BpnpAagQ

She lost all credibility in the Netherlands because of her lies, so now she's pandering to idiots in the US. And if you look at her work, the stuff she writes or says, she never backs any of it up.

&gt; Some of the more moderate Muslim countries may give women an option, but most do not. Most need a male companion to leave the house

That's not true. That's in Saudi-Arabia. In most countries they do in fact have a choice.

&gt; their testimony under Sharia is worth half of a man's,

In sone instances a woman's testimony is worth more than a man's.

&gt; genital mutilation

You call it genital mutilation, they call it circumcision. Almost all countries have banned FGM, but it happens illegally. Male circumcision is normal though.

&gt; I wonder why hundreds of European women have been sexually assaulted, told to cover up, harassed, and/or raped by Muslim refugees simply for dressing in normal western clothing???

Source?

&gt; If you want some examples just look at articles and YouTube videos of Muslim attacks on women in Europe such as Cologne Germany for example.

Link them. What happened in Cologne was done by the people who did that. A dozen drunk, sexist, idiotic animals aren't representative of 1.6 billion people.

&gt; Sweden is now the rape capital of Europe btw.

Which has absolutely nothing to do with Islam? The reason they're the ""rape capital"" is because they changed the definition of rape a while ago. What's considered harassment in other countries is considered rape in Sweden. Also the way they handle rape cases, if a woman was raped every day for two years by her husband that counts as 730 rape cases, while in most other countries it's just one case. There was also a lot of encouragement and work done to make women report rape more. But hey, when you want to smear something you're ignorant about it's easier to just ignore the facts I guess.

&gt; I'm not going to do the research for you because I've already done it, but there's a plethora of info on this out there. This is the tip of the iceberg but I'll get u started tho

Said the person who has nothing to back up his claims with.

People like this *are* pretending however that muslim women are suffering some kind of Stockholm Syndrome, and are all constantly afraid for their lives. This is because they are ignorant and their knowledge of Islam comes from post 9/11, war on terror propaganda. The point is that these cases are an extreme minority, and ordinary muslims should not be expected to act as if they're representatives for their entire religion."
573,dspdrih,"Society is not made up of individuals, it's made up of *families*.

In science you have the concept of the *molecule*, the smallest possible division of a thing you can have whilst still clearly remaining as that thing. In layman's terms, a water molecule that's the tiniest possible drop of water whilst still clearly being water.

The divide between enlightenment centric ideologies (liberalism, socialism, sometimes fascism) and conservative/reactionary ones is over what is the *molecule* of society. The enlightenment's children argue it's the individual, conservatives argue it's *the family*. Individuals are just that, individuals, each individual is an island unto himself, he has his own history, he has his own memories, his own feelings, his own personality, his own ideology, he has no connection to anyone. The etymology of *society* comes from the latin word *societas* which in turn is derived from *socius* which means ""friend"" or ""ally"". In the word itself you have the understanding of a *special* relationship, something transcending merely ""two individuals existing in one place"". The earliest human societies themselves were derived from flesh and blood clans and built in part through *marriage*, through the joining of families together into larger units.

The problem we have today is that both children of the enlightenment reject--to different degrees--the understanding of the family as paramount to society, and thus have opened Pandora's Box to the utter destruction of civilized society through a thousand little causes nipping and biting at the foundations of our world. Instead you merely have individuals living side-by-side in one place, the unity is gone, and... well the old saying ""Hell is other people"" comes to mind.

Since I'll rarely get a chance to talk about this especially pungent ideology, take feminism as an example. The stereotype, almost to the point of being understood as common fact, is that feminists don't know what they want and are willing to heckle men over almost anything. Take Anita Sarkeesian as an example: if a woman in a video game is overtly feminine and sexual, she would decry it as a ""fighting fucktoy"", if a woman in question is fairly ""plain"" looking or even muscular and her attitude is masculine, she'd use the trope of--I believe it's called ""Mrs. Man"" or something along those lines--to lambast it. Unrelated to what I know of Ms. Sarkeesian, if a woman wants to present herself as a ""slut"" or wear provocative clothing, then it's perfectly acceptable for her to do so and she's controlling her sexuality. If a man looks at a woman even remotely sexually, then he's ""objectifying"" her and it's bad--the same doesn't apply to trashy women's romance novels however.

If you look at *any* piece of feminist theory, and this is a promise, you can find just below it another bit of feminist theory which completely contradicts what you previously read, and we must ask ourselves *why* that is. The answer is simply because what feminism boils down to is a kind of psuedo-class war with gender turned into a class in and of itself, it doesn't seek vaunted *equality* instead it's about maximizing women's ""power"" in the sexual dynamic whilst undermining the male's.

The previous, more ""patriarchal"" system they lambast was family focused and more inclined to build actually stable societies. A system of social-shaming existed to repress the sexuality of women--which in turn represses the sexuality of men--and encouraged long-term thinking in much the same way that a cold climate could encourage long-term planning in agricultural communities. Women when looking for a partner weren't seeking solely looks alone, but preferably someone who could provide for them, was responsible, and had a personality that they'd feel comfortable spending what was potentially the rest of their life with.

Then came the ""sexual liberation"" and the scales were tipped. Women essentially gravitated towards the ""Chads"" to borrow an /r9k/ term and thus ended up creating this monstrosity of a society where they'd happily kill any infant of theirs because they expect their twenties to last well into their thirties and forties, and a generation of angry young incels. Sexual needs form the bottom, the foundation basis of Mazlowe's hierarchy, and it's men who actually struggle to express themselves sexually, if they can't fulfill that *base need* then even if everything else on the hierarchy is checked off, they'd still be angry and unsatisfied.

Spengler put it best, the *genus* of a civilization is in the womb of its women, because generally speaking it was women that would stay home and raise the children. So you could say Muslim Women are oppressed by Muslim Men, but at the same time you could also say that Muslim Women *create* Muslim Men.

There should be a large level of conformity in society, that's how you keep society going, and in spite of the cries of a thousand grunge rockstars and ""counter-culture"" movements, *that* is how you leave people feeling fulfilled and happy."

577,dnj1s6c,"Benjamin Pogrund is an expert on Apartheid and Israel, who lived under both regimes and was jailed by the South African state for his opposition to Apartheid. I'm quite sure he isn't a lightweight.

The areas of Palestine controlled by Israel are not part of Israel. The crimes committed against the people in those areas by Israel are not apartheid&amp;mdash;which is a domestic crime committed against residents and citizens of a state, by a state&amp;mdash;they are war crimes, committed by a foreign occupying power. You'll note that I am not, and never have, denied that the Israeli government has committed crimes against the Palestinian people.

In fact, Arabs living in Israel, while they do face discrimination, have the same rights as other citizens. If the existence of social, but not legal, discrimination against an ethnic minority makes Israel an apartheid state, then I suspect every state in the world is an apartheid state.

While discrimination exists in Israel, as in all countries, it is against the law to deliberately discriminate against Arabs (or other minorities), in the same way as it is in the UK. Policies that have been shown to be discriminatory in practice, such as government ownership of most of the land, have been successfully challenged in Israel's own courts. In Apartheid South Africa, this was not possible, because discrimination *was* the law.

[Here](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jul/23/highereducation.uk) is Ian Buruma, a professor of human rights, making the same argument:

&gt;Inside the state of Israel, there is no apartheid. In proportion to its population, Israel has the largest minority within its borders of any country in the Middle East. [...] **Non-Jews, mostly Arab Muslims, make up 20% of the Israeli population, and they enjoy full citizen's rights. Israel is one of the few Middle Eastern states where Muslim women are allowed to vote.**

That is not apartheid.

[Here](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/opinion/israel-and-the-apartheid-slander.html) is Richard Goldstone, a South African judge who helped undermine apartheid, making similar arguments."

These people are fundamentally angry losers, they probably view everything as a ""culture war"" and the whole issue of women's rights is a big part of it. A lot of South Asian Muslims were similarly angry when Tunisian women were allowed to marry non-Muslims last week, even if it has nothing to do with them.

And why does he assume based on these that only non-Muslim women are fair game?

It's hard for me to even parse what his ideology is, other than ethnostatism, which mostly makes me roll my eyes, and objecting to ""white-bashing"" (with which I broadly agree).

Even if he's right and diversity comes with more problems than can be offset by its benefits, okay. Now what? How do we get from where we are to where he wants to be without violence and coercion? Not to mention (or that is, to mention again) the fact that a lot of the black people in the US these guys seem most hell bent on segregating whites from aren't in the US because their ancestors *chose* to move there. 

I mean, in what is perhaps the understatement of the century, it's a little bit of a dick move to look at blacks and say, ""we don't want you here anymore"" when it was your ancestors who forcibly brought them to the US in the first place. Not that I think whites today bear a responsibility to atone for slavery, but you know, they could at least consider that it's not the fault of blacks descended from that time that they're even in the US, you know?

Would be nice if they could both look at each other and say, ""well, I guess we're stuck with each other. Let's make the most of it and just be decent,"" you know?

I mean, I wouldn't even necessarily be against monetary reparations, except 1) I don't think it would have the intended effect in the black community, at least not at this point, and 2) I think at this point (particularly when looking at the kids at Evergreen), monetary reparations would only be the beginning of a new list of demands and atonement. Kind of the way no apology is ever good enough for these types of people (the SJWs speaking ""on behalf"" of all blacks, that is), the apology is only the wedge they use to get in there and really fuck with you. 

&gt;The avoidance-as-guilt argument holds some water and your lengthy experience gives it some weight. However, I wouldn't be much of a psychologist if I didn't point out that this is some crystal ball inspired post-hoc rationalizing. It's impossible to refute because it didn't happen; and it's impossible to prove because lack of evidence is never evidence.

VICE did quite the number on him. They also did a number on me a while back, and changed the name of the video to ""MRAs think rape victims deserve it"" or some shit a month after they uploaded it. I've been dealing with Marcotte's and Futrelle's cherry picking and guilt by association for ages. 

I was on Cantwell's show a while back (fall of 2015?) and I can't link to it because it's behind a paywall. He struck me as a bit of a loon. Like I said elsewhere in this post, he seems like an unstable guy who picks up radical movements, squeezes what little juice he can get out of them until the excitement fades or the inconsistencies become apparent, then moves onto the next one. 

I have to admit, I was curious about what he thinks, and how well it matched what was being said about him. I mean, VICE didn't *technically* lie about me and other female MRAs in their piece (other than the changed title), but they applied a LOT of spin.

I could show you the Skype text conversation preceding the interview. It lasted about 6 minutes from when he pinged me to when we started, and half of that was taken up by my guy demanding to know what was going on. I came right out and told Cantwell I was hesitant to touch the topic, given the media coverage. It really was a spur of the moment decision. Part of it might have been general contrariness--kind of a, ""fuck the media and what they'll say about it, I'll do what I want"" thing (which is something that has gotten me into trouble, but also benefitted me, I'm sure you'll understand). 

And to be frank, I've been... well, about a year ago, I started thinking about my kids, and all this shit going on (not just racial tensions and men's rights issues and the general polarization of the political landscape, but the totality of the mess my kids are going to inherit, the debt load they'll be shouldering, the future fallout from the culture wars, everything), and started extrapolating in my head where it all might be headed, and that sent me into a three day crying jag. 

That also informs my compulsion to understand what's going on. 

&gt;I agree and I think that's a shame. Taking an outcome oriented approach, this alone may be sufficient evidence of the harm done here. You're an important voice. Losing any bit of your traction over Cantwell wasn't worth it to us, at least some of us.

If I thought of things in that way, I wouldn't stand up for Muslim men when their culture is bashed as inherently misogynistic or when Muslim women are portrayed as the ""ultimate innocent victims who have absolutely no power whatsoever and whose men must be destroyed because of it"". The backlash I get over my opinions on Islam is hilarious--I get bashed for saying I don't think Muslim men hate their own women, and then bashed for saying I don't like Islam itself and that mass Islamic immigration is cultural suicide. Alison coined a term for it: Islam-apolo-phobia. 

Is giving Cantwell his say worth what it might cost the men's movement? Probably not in a lot of people's minds. But everyone with whom I'm officially associated (Paul at AVFM and Alison at HBR) knows that if I have to choose between that association and saying what I want to say, I'll wish them well and be on my way. 

&gt;This is upsetting, mostly because it's true. Cantwell shit in the bed we were trying to make and then, with your complicity, acts like we should thank him for answering the mail on BLM and Antifa.

You're free to hate Cantwell. I can understand why you would, and why you'd hate me for giving him a platform. I personally don't hate anyone. It's hard to hate people when you realize how evolved we're not. Might as well hate the rain for falling on you. 

&gt;A decade and a half of war is taking too high a toll on this generation. 

What is ""too high a toll"" really depends on the war, no? Assuming casualties were roughly equal on both sides, 300,000 deaths to end slavery (among other things), and 300,000 to maintain it. Was it a good war? Did it take too high a toll? 420,000 US deaths to stop Hitler. Was that a good war? Would Rwanda have been a good war, had the US decided to intervene?

&gt;As for fighting Antifa, you're damn right. I don't suffer communists well at all.

Neither do I. I hope your hope for an armed moderate majority pans out. Problem with moderates is that they don't feel strongly enough one way or the other to take up arms.
"
586,djjw8hh,"You're not informing me of anything. It's not rape. I think you need to understand what brainwashing and rape are.

Muslim women are willing to do these kinds of things for their husbands and they are consenting. That is not rape. You're the one who is being obtuse. 

Why they are consenting, is a different matter, brainwashing or for another reason, they are still consenting.

Rape is when they rape the female war captives, not their Muslim wives. 

If someone was manipulated into having sex with someone else even if its bad for them, then it's not rape. It was out of their own will. If Muslim wives believed that being a sex toy for their husbands is what they're supposed to be to please Allah, then that is their belief and their life. It does not mean it's right, but it's their belief, therefore it's not rape."
587,din406j,"&gt; while I dislike Islam it definitely does not condone rape

While Islam prohibits rape of Muslims, other people's slaves, and Dhimmis, we know that Islam does condone the rape of captive women for people that Muslims are at war against. And since there are a good number of Muslims that are taught that Islam is in perpetual warfare against all of the [not yet subjugated] unbelievers, it is not too hard conclude that all non Muslim women are fair game."
588,disuskr,"It does in most countries. The Near East is typical example of that, the % decrease of Christians in the region is due much more to the higher Muslim birth rates than alleged emigration.

*In this paper, we examine differentials in fertility between Christians and Muslims in three poor communities in Greater Beirut, Lebanon using data from the 2002 – 2003 Urban Health Survey. Results from the adjusted parity progression ratios show that young Christian and Muslim women are significantly less likely to progress to the next parity than their older counterparts. However, fertility decline among Christians is much more significant. The onset of the decline in Muslim fertility – especially at parities three, four and five – seems to coincide with the end of the civil war in the early 1990’s, while that of Christians is at least 10 years earlier.  The differences in marital fertility by religious affiliation persist after  controlling for differences in socio-economic conditions, religiosity, and cultural capital. We discuss context-specific explanations of the religious fertility differences taking into account Lebanon’s social, economic, historic and political context.*

The three authors also happen to be Muslim, so I doubt they had any agenda, furthermore they come from respectable universities."

594,dh99y90,"Yes. But according to them concubinage is what your right hand possesses but they ignore the fact that that phrase is also used with Muslim women. So by their logic Muslim women are allowed to have male concubines as well. But they wouldn't ever admit that!! 
They tried claiming it was a form of marriage but obviously it's not. They're just pushing their agenda because of this day and age in hopes that they can use and abuse as ISIS does. It's sad and sickening.
Prisoners of war are just that prisoners and are not sex toys as Hamid and rizwan believe. And no matter how Much they want to seduce you it still is wrong. 
They also tried the argument ""these women have needs""
Yeah so does my neighbor but I didn't sleep with him.. I am married to my husband and that's it. Besides these females Hamid and rizwan speak of are PRISONERS. not people to serve... They came up with every excuse they could. It was so sad"
595,diybl2y,"&gt; There has been a growth in more conservative Islam fueled largely by Saudi Arabia. If you're looking for quantitative data points, I'm sorry to disappoint you, they don't exist. Every country has different ways have collecting data. France's numbers have to be estimated, because they aren't allowed to do a census on religious practices. If you want to get an idea though, look at how western Muslims answer questions on human rights issues. There is a troubling amount of support for Sharia law among British muslims, and the majority of british muslims think homosexuality should be illegal. Forget gay marriage they think being gay should be a crime.

&gt; If you are unfamiliar with the rise of the Wahhabi ideology, this one is a good idea of how it's being financed and spread

i am very familiar with wahhabism. and yes, there is some polling data on the issue. it hasn't spread nearly as well to other countries outside of the middle east as you might think. 

there are obvious [regional variation of islamic beliefs](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/) including in parts of europe where polling has been done, that shows moderation of views when they move to more secular societies. 

additionally, there is good data on american muslims [that show lots of signs of moderation](http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-appendix-a/) which isn't suprising in the slightest, especially many muslims in the mid west have been here for generations are are very americanized. 

the article about sweden was [actually about the appointment of a niquab wearign spokesman for a prominent muslim group in norway](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39429439) there was lots of backlash not only by the secular government, but by other muslim groups and MPs as indicated int the article. 

&gt; There were whole cities in the US, where German was the main language and they had German language newspapers ect. There were whole pockets in American society that were foreign. That all disappeared around WWI. You could make the case that these groups were still integrated back then, as many of them had taken mainstream American jobs in civil service, ect., but assimilation happened later.

the article i linked to talked about all of this, and in fact, those city districts didn't completely disappear to my understanding (especially the catholic irish still had identity quite later after ww2). The article also indicates *significant and obvious* integration going on well before the war. 

This still doesn't negate my ""few generations"" point, 1880's wave to ww2 is still a few generations. 


&gt;Well if your a protestant that speaks english it's certainly easier to pass, however I don't think this was the case, and I didn't see that in the article either. Children of protestant irish immigrants born in America were never immigrants themselves. That fact that the majority of Irish Americans today are protestants and not Catholics could be related to the rate of natural growth &amp; availability of catholic churches in the colonial era. All this tells me is that more Irish protestants moved in the early history of the US, but as far as raw numbers of immigrants I doubt they would outnumber the catholic irish.

I probably mis read the article here, i'll has go back and review some more later, i'm in a rush to do other things. 


&gt; I don't doubt that people can integrate. Even if you look at Europe there is a lot of genetic diversity that wouldn't be apparent just by speaking with people. The question is what factors led to this integration.

THIS is a good point. and WW2 is a big factor you are correct. but maybe not for the reason that you think. Economics seems to play a very important roll for integration, and ww2 and the post ww2 era was the greatest period of economic growth in american history, dwarfing the good periods of growth that came before it. 

If you look at countries and areas in europe with worse levels of integration, you see relative or extreme poverty as well. If you put that on an international context you see a general trend also (with some exceptions like saudi arabia, which can be largely explained away via governmental factors). 

What is needed more than anything else is good jobs, integration programs, and education, to help speed along integration. Some countries are doing this much better than others, and we can certainly speed up the process by learning from those doing things right. 

&gt; If I had to make a quick theory as why these groups fit in so well, I'd say the two main factors are service in the military (drafted) and interracial marriage. In this case I mean race as in ethnicity. The issue we have today, is most western countries don't have a draft, and there is a culture in Islamic society that still sees women as commodities. The more conservative sects don't want their daughters dating western men, and will often find them a nice muslim man for the right price.

this is why a lot of european countries are putting in place laws that make it unavoidable to interact with other people. these groups only survive based on isolation, which is why you even see the swiss expelling immigrants who refuse to let their children swim with the opposite sex. co-ed Educational institutions and after school programs are a great start. 

&gt; Additionally threats of violence and honor killings further limit islamic women's choices. Islamic men are free to date whomever they want, but quite often the girl will need to either be a muslim or convert to be acceptable to the family.

sure, insular communities need to be prevented from coming about, like what has happened in parts of europe. Victims also need to know their options. 

&gt;So we have some huge stumbling blocks ahead of us on the road to integration, and even with third generation muslims in the west, there is a chasm between their western counterparts. The same cannot be said of the immigrants of European or East Asian background living in the west

i think actually 3rd generation muslims in the United states are much less radical than many of the christians here. [they are definitely more conservative than the general populace](https://www.livescience.com/5157-truth-muslims-america.html) but they are certainly better than some of the powerful evangelical groups.

596,frb0t9j,"If anything this idea that women who don’t belong to the feminist collective are brainwashed is misogynistic itself. What so women can’t think for themselves if they’re not feminist? Why can’t you say that Islamic men are brainwashed too and that they’re not inherently evil, you’re kinda implying that men are all evil geniuses this way. 

If you want more men to hold each other accountable, you got to start holding other women accountable as well, men and women are not enemies stop encouraging that idea."
597,emy51pa,"One thing I should let you know, there are some Mosques where they practice things that are uhh just wrong. This is, as far as I am aware, more common in the UK than the US. For example, they may have policies that Muslim women are not allowed to enter and/or pray and they would use the justification that the better reward that men get for praying is to pray in the Mosque in congregation and the better reward that women get is to pray at home. In theory, this is correct. However, all Mosques must be welcoming to both men and women and to ban entry to women is completely wrong in Islam. Mosques **should** have facilities for females regardless if it is better for women to pray at home. This, as far as I am aware, is a cultural practice in some places in some Asian countries. In other words, if it is practiced more in one country, you will still find a lot of Mosques not having wrong policies like this. 

Though if you do come across any such practices, don't challenge them on it of course since they will take offense. Rather, it is the responsibility for knowledgeable Muslims in the community to privately try and advise the leadership of the Mosque. The vast majority of Mosques, as far as I am aware, are not like this at all and are very accommodating to everyone. In fact, I have never encountered any such Mosques like this. Have only heard about them from social media drama.

As for the elephant in the room.

There are two main sects in Islam: Sunnism and Shi’ism. Practically all Mosques will either belong to one of the two. Sunnis and Shias generally go to their own respective Mosques and do not overlap since there are important theological differences in some areas, especially in regards to history and how they pray. I am Sunni and of course would say to visit a Sunni Mosque. However, it’s mostly irrelevant to someone who is non-Muslim, so I wouldn’t worry about it. More important than understanding the political split between the two and the subsequent differing of religious practices and theological differences, is to understand the basics of the faith and to read the Qur’an to understand what it’s all about. Sunnis and Shias have most things in common. If you were to understand the basics of Islam and the Qur’an, you would have a better idea of the two sects and their differences, ie. you could put them in context.

I would tell you to keep an open mind. Pray to God that you will be guided to the truth and that is all that you need. Whether or not Sunnism is the truth or Shi’ism is the truth, there are people who get misguided from both and there are people who get misguided from Islam altogether. So, the only advice I would give is if you believe in God, pray for the guidance and the truth to be made clear in front of you.

Also, regardless of these differences between Sunnis and Shias, it still takes precedence for the two groups to maintain good relations. As long as good relations exist, it is possible for the two to coexist as two groups with different religious practices, in the same way that Muslims in general are commanded to coexist with the people of the book (Christians and Jews). In line with the teachings of the Prophet, it is not right at all for either group to have ill manners towards the other, in the same way that it is wrong for Muslims to have ill manners towards those of other faiths. And about separation in religious practices, as I said before, Sunnis and Shias generally stay separate from one another, though in my faith, Sunnis and Shias, as with Muslims in general, can pray side by side in congregation as long as nobody holds fringe extreme views which take them outside the fold of Islam. Though from my understanding, these beliefs are extremely rare amongst Shia and are not as popular as some Sunnis think. 

But as I was saying, in terms of what is established amongst scholarship, most of what the two groups believe is the same, such as the Oneness of God/Allah (SWT). The treatment of fellow human beings, the practices, kindness and etiquette of the Prophet Muhammad Peace Be Upon Him even in dealing with his enemies who oppressed him and his followers and the belief in the Prophets of God. Sunnis and Shias all accept the same Qur’an. Though, there are some extreme sects, who would reject the Qur’an. From my understanding, they are rejected by both Sunni and Shia scholarship from Islam even if they claim themselves to be Shia Muslims. Accepting the Qur’an and its preservation is universally considered to be one of the foundations of faith. In the same way that we accept the Oneness of Allah (SWT).

I can almost guarantee you will not encounter any of the fringe groups, but it’s important to be aware that those differences do exist out there in the wilderness, though not in the basics of Islam as far as mainstream Sunnis and Shias are concerned. The basic foundations of faith amongst Sunni and Shia are agreed upon and both accept the same Qur’an.

I would tell you not to worry about these differences; I believe if any person is sincere, these differences would not be as problematic as non-Muslims tend to think they would be since they’ve been fed this lie that Sunnis and Shias are always out to kill each other, which isn’t true at all. I say this because the devil tries to delay people from finding out about Islam by convincing them they can just “do it later” and if I was learning about Islam, sectarianism is one of the issues that would confuse me and make me put it on hold. But it’s not as important as you would think, especially in the beginning.

If you would like to read the Qur’an: https://www.quran.com/

599,e0ft94m,"&gt; Covering the hair is NOT a recent phenomena.

read the actual words I said.  not the words you want me to say.

LEGALLY enforcing hair covering is a recent phenomena.

&gt;The first muslim women were commanded to cover their hair and their body, and its still the same until today.

they were never commanded to cover their hair. they did it because it was a cultural norm in Arabia, Greece, Rome, and most of the Mediterranean.  

&gt;Some scholars even say that women should cover their faces except for their eyes.

this was based on the fact that Muhammad had his wives cover their faces (which wasn't uncommon in Arabia for both genders at the time) so that they wouldn't be the targets of his rivals and enemies.

&gt; All of the verses in the Quran and the words of the prophet Muhammad state confirm that all muslim women are obliged to cover themselves.

it says nowhere in the Quran, or any Hadith, that hair is required to be covered.

&gt;Ask any muslim scholar about this matter and he will tell you that wearing the hijab is obligatory

obligatory is not the word.  Again, I was talking about Legally enforcing the hijab, but let's ignore that you didn't really read my post for a moment.  These scholars would argue that God tells women they should cover their hair (which I disagree with, but lets set this aside as well).  they doen't usually say ""Muslims are obligated to force women to cover their hair.""  they would say ""Women should choose to cover their hair if they want to be good Muslims."""
600,e0isazx,"I think a lot of people don't realize how far your beliefs echo into everyday life including how it effects your own character and trust. There have been so many scenarios that come up now in my own relationship that would have ended up very badly if my wife wasn't really a firm Christian. And to have something objective (God's Word) that you can appeal to in times of turmoil is very helpful. 

Some more advice on your question. When you marry the girl you also marry the family. Unfortunately this can make get a together tough with the in-laws when they disagree so much with your religion. Is her mother also super serious about Islam? Then prepare for her to start trying to get you believe what she believes or she will treat you with contempt otherwise. You also have look far into the future and realize is this the person I want looking after my kids and influencing them as they grow up? If not, then you have to be clear with your potential spouse during marriage counseling (before marriage) that you don't want her to be much of an influence in your kid's life. 

&gt;I am a Christian man and I am deeply in love with a muslim women.

Are you thinking with your head or with your heart? Remember that:

**Jeremiah 17:9** ""The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?""

Often times God's commands seem arbitrary and without explanation. But there are good reasons why God tells us not to do things. 

**2 Corinthians 6:14-15** ""Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?""

Paul urges believers not to form binding relationships with nonbelievers, because this might weaken their Christian commitment, integrity, or standards. It would be a mismatch. Earlier, Paul had explained that this did not mean isolating oneself from nonbelievers (see 1 Corinthians 5:9,10). Paul even tells Christians to stay with their non-believing spouses (1 Corinthians 7:12,13). Paul wants believers to be active in their witness for Christ to nonbelievers, but they should not lock themselves into personal or business relationships that could cause them to compromise the faith. Believers should do everything in their power to avoid situations that could force them to divide their loyalties.

These verses also have strong application to marriage. Paul did not want single believers to enter into marriage with unbelievers. Such marriages cannot have unity in the most important issue in life - commitment and obedience to God. Because marriage involves two people becoming one, faith may become an issue, and one spouse may have to compromise beliefs for the sake of unity. Many people discount this problem only to regret it later. Don't allow emotion or passion to bind you with someone who will not be your spiritual partner. For those who have discovered God's light, there can be no fellowship or compromise with darkness (1 Corinthians 10:20,21). 

For a Christian, dating a non-Christian is unwise, and marrying one is not an option. Second Corinthians 6:14 tells us not to be “unequally yoked” with an unbeliever. The imagery is of two incompatible oxen sharing the same yoke. Instead of working together to pull the load, they would be working against each other. While this passage does not specifically mention marriage, it definitely has implications for marriage. The passage goes on to say that there is no harmony between Christ and Belial (Satan). There can be no spiritual harmony in a marriage between a Christian and a non-Christian. Paul goes on to remind believers that they are the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, who inhabits their hearts at salvation (2 Corinthians 6:15-17). Because of that, they are to be separate from the world—in the world, but not of the world—and nowhere is that more important than in life’s most intimate relationship—marriage.

The Bible also says, “Do not be misled: ‘Bad company corrupts good character’ (1 Corinthians 15:33). Having any kind of intimate relationship with an unbeliever can quickly turn into something that is a hindrance to your walk with Christ. Look how Solomon's heart was led astray from God from his foreign wives! We are called to evangelize the lost, not be intimate with them. There is nothing wrong with building quality friendships with unbelievers, but that is as far as it should go. If you were dating an unbeliever, what would honestly be your priority, romance or winning a soul for Christ? If you were married to an unbeliever, how would the two of you cultivate a spiritual intimacy in your marriage? How could a quality marriage be built and maintained if you disagree on the most crucial issue in the universe—the Lord Jesus Christ?

There comes a time where we must follow God above all others (even our own family). I am not saying give up hope for this person (as God has not given up hope in our sinful lives) but there will be a division which will test where your loyalties lie. Either with God or with mankind (those closest to you).

**Matthew 10:33-38** “Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn “ ‘a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law— a man’s enemies will be the members of his own household.’ “Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.""

In the end it will all come down to if you are willing to put them first or Christ first. You can start dating, get married, even have children, but that question will always come up in everything. For remember what Jesus said about putting personal relationships above His Truth."
601,dgzt6b5,"Hello :) Dear lord, I hope you do not actually believe that. But let me try to answer to the best of my ability.

&gt; Sorry, but when was arab culture and Islam seperate? Muhammad was an Arab.

It is separate by means of 'culture' and 'religion'. Culture is what have existed even way before or formed after the religion manifest itself. They are hereby separate. If the religion first manifest in the arab soil, does not mean it carries the same element as the culture. 

In this issue, before abrahamic religion is popular to the arabs, they were riddled with *assabiyah* practices; they kill, they rob and rape the women of different groups/tribes and if I recall correctly they live as nomads (not all arabs lived like this, some arabs have businesses and the majority of them worship deities) and religion was ought to correct barbaric practices and give women more right other than just a sex slave, though this is not the only reason. Women's rights span as the right to speak as an equal to men, the right to have education, to walk without being seen as sex object and so on and so forth.

&gt; His religion was for Arabs, they spread it, by the sword, to the rest of the world.

If you actually have taken the time to read actual history book (not the Quran, obviously because no one would do that /s) or even contemporary writer about the history of Islam, you will know that no such thing happened without provocation and threats from enemies (Battle of Hunayn and Battle of Tabouk for reference). Surrendered enemies were allowed to keep their religion, with conditions (but I think the religions concerned were abrahamic, not pagans). It is incorrect to think that he spread it to the **rest of the world** because his conquest was only concerning arabia. The rest of the world though, was the doing of the Islamic rulers after him.

&gt; did Muhammad's wives (not the one before he started proselytizing) wear any form of covering over themselves?

Yes they did, but they did so because they were the wives of Muhammad, plus Muhammad did not tell them to dress explicitly that way (btw abayaas and headscarf existed even before Islam, as cultural accessories). Muhammad's first wife (with whom he had all his children but one with) was the first person to convert and dressed modestly. There is no verse in the Quran that tells women to cover up with abayaas and burqas leaving only their eyes uncovered. The reason the muslim community force this unto muslim women is, for the reason to copy Muhammad and his wives's way of living, which shouldn't carry any penalty if not followed. Muslim women are not required to follow this practice, and the men who indoctrinates this to the women are oppressing them. Wear a helmet and she's good to go.

I am not an arab, but why does that matter? Islam is not an exclusively arab religion. What shackles muslim women is the community, not the religion itself. Peace y'all."
602,fyz8i4n,"What about the Muslim scriptures that tell to kill all kafirs?? The way Muslim women are treated by Muslim men?? What about LGBTQ people??what about quran and hadiths which literally contain few verses ridiculing or straight up killing non Muslims??

603,fvak1d4,"As a Muslim women I have seen this. It also similar to how some Muslim women wear jeans or more form fitting clothes as a way for fitting in, rather than wearing the burka. Also the multiple versions of “hijab” we see today. A lot of western Muslim woman make certain compromises to face less  issues where they live. To look less “threatening” in a way. And yes, different Muslim women are treated differently in western countries based on how “extremist” they look."

Lol who hurt you.. The Prophet(S) married. His Sahabah married. The Prophet(S) told them to marry and not be extremists. 

&gt;A man can be pious and all that and stay away from haraam but finding a religious, pious girl on deen that is not brainwashed by modern liberalism and extreme feminism is like finding a diamond in the middle of a desert.

That's a pretty sexist thought. Does Allah not guide both men and women to the right path? Not all Muslim women are ""extreme feminists"". It's not my problem if you've never met a pious girl. You just sound bitter, you don't need to generalize all women. 

I want to work, it's not a sin. Khadija(R) worked as well. I'm not going to abandon my duties as a mother, but the father shouldn't abandon his duties either. Many people don't have a proper father figure these days because the dad was too busy with work and the mother did all the raising.

606,fn0g3i5,You’re correct. Saying “I have a problem with what the Quran says on [insert topic here]” is not the same thing as saying “All Muslims are extremists!” Especially since Muslim women are staying true to their religion while simultaneously going to jail for refusing to wear a hijab.
607,fjxobuf,"All religions cherry-pick what’s more convenient for them. They are all lies and made up. You can’t say that Muslim women are retarded because they choose to have faith. The way you judge doesn’t make you any better than any other extremist. Men get to abuse and control women regardless of religion. Look at Trump, Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein, Bill Cosby, and all the Christians who keep being accused of sexual assault. Perhaps you just hate Muslims."
608,fenkuev,True I actually thought about muslimmaxxing by converting to islam because I'd probably be able to get a wife easily and muslim women are modest which I find attractive but I cant grow a beard (low testosterone) so if I tried to go to a mosque they'd probably think I'm some right wing extremist about to shoot the place up
609,fdeojtu,"I agree with this, it's best to not act like you know what ""you"" weren't really experienced. And I don't think there's anything wrong with adopting elements from other cultures unless it's done in a mocking way.

Culture has always been changing, flowing in and out through human history. Who owns dreadlocks? People in India did it for a long time as well? What about box braids?.. it's hard to say if it was true but there's a possibility that European people were doing many small braided hair when the Romans were describing Celts as having ""hair like snakes"". Ancient Egypt had braids, but they did not see themselves as either black or white in American term. (In the mural, they painted themselves brown, with Nubian having dark skin and Libyan having lighter skin colour).
I think the issues with hair style is that in the past, something like dreadlocks were not seen as professional and many black people were told to change it. I understand the anger, but I don't think segregation is the way.

The Chinese prom dress drama? Han-chinese appropriate it from the Manchu first, and then women we're shamed and killed for wearing it during the revolution... Many of the people who claimed cultural appropriation during the drama were CCP supporters. Things are complicated.

The biggest issues I have for me is that the accuse of cultural appropriation tend to come from the conservative side of that culture that ended up being oppressive and limiting to many in that community. Ex-muslim women are both hurted by Islamic extremists and many misogynistic rules, but woke/progressives also want to protect Islam and shut ex-Muslim women down.

I'm from Thailand and I felt the same. We're struggling with corrupt dictatorship who doesn't want our culture to go anywhere to protect the power, they want to keep the traditional value and using ""anti-western propaganda"". Many wanted to change those things but we could not, now coming to the west and I almost felt like those ""woke"" people would rather support dictators who throw people in prisons for dissenting rather than see ""pure and innocent PoC culture being tainted by the West""."
610,f4036jc,"&gt;Think about that, a nun is the most extremist of religious woman though,

Back in the days, ALL Christian women used to wear 'hijab'. The problem is not that Muslim women are extremists. It's actually Christian women who refuse to follow Christianity and modesty.

Ask a nun if ALL Christian women are supposed to wear a veil or not, she'll tell you.

Every culture has basically forced women to wear veil and be modest. Islam is not an exception, it's the rule."
611,f4mdeum,"Ironically, the muslim women are more conservative and modestly dressed compared to the more liberal western women shown. Are they arguing against religious conservatism? What about how we went from a president who doesn’t cheat on his pregnant wife with a porn star to one that embodies the seven capital sins.

I should imagine I in particular have come up in the back channel by now, because I'm an asshole. But I'm Team Nadsatdevotchka. 

Muslim women are put on the back burner. Make no mistake- every lib fem I know is well aware of how harmful religious modesty is to women in Christian and Mormon extremist circles. (I say extremist because it's very rare to see a weirdly dressed Christian in the US, and they are virtually nonexistent elsewhere). And they act like it's a huge, out of control, horrible problem. The truth is, families like the Duggars are rare, and don't usually go beyond two generations. Even Mormon polygamists are on the decline, and more leave than enter. The way both putter along is through a high birth rate. So when lib fems turn a blind eye to the suffering of Muslim women, or hand wave their problems claiming Muslim women have no unique issues is so dishonest and selfish. They crunched the numbers in the ~~Pythagorean~~ Identitarian Triangle, subtracted *~~Pi~~* pomo, and carried the 1. Ex-Muslim women just aren't interesting enough. Some public ones are suspiciously close to conservatives, and might leave a not-woke stain on your shirt, which is really fucking hard to get out. So they ignore you. But that's okay. They're douche bags. They cannot help you. 

You're gonna loooooooooooove radical feminists. We're not the fun kind of feminists. We are bone crushing hyenas, and we don't hold back.

In the same year, Zac Goldsmith ran a failed London mayoral campaign, where he dogwhistled Sadiq Khan “repeatedly legitimised those with extremist views”. Theresa May, of course, was Home Secretary when the Home Office ran the ""go home"" vans campaign for about a month in 2013 (reportedly 11 people took up the kind offer). Earlier this month, her government rejected a cross-party definition of Islamophobia."

For women they are supposed to wear a scarf, and not show their body at all. The girl in the picture is a good example on how a Muslim women should dress. Not every Muslim follows these rules tho. And I’m also not trying to be mean or insulting, I’m just trying to provide correct information. The women that you see covering every part of their body including their face in all black is considered an extreme. Muslim women are not forced to dress like that. In Saudi Arabia they are bc that country is corrupt and in my opinion don’t represent the Muslim religion. And of course neither do any of the extremists."
617,ee01joz,"&gt;What is this with the mindset that Pakistani is a superior race (for some people) and outsiders are consider bad?

I have not met any Pakistani who thinks he's racially superior to non-Pakistanis in 20 years of my life. I don't know what made you feel that.

However, here's a trend of going to Germany for Masters. Usually engineering students go there after bachelors. There is no concept of student loan here, so the education is usually funded by parents. And since education is funded by parents, Pakis would refrain from having Western girlfriends.

The second factor is Islam. Being brainwashed till 14th grade (Islamic studies is compulsory till 14th) and even after that, the guys who move abroad have the Islamic mindset that non-Muslim women are immoral, immodest and unloyal etc. It takes time to get rid of this mindset... and until that they are already married to a Pakistani woman.

The third factor is language. Urdu is a sweet language and good for romance :P

P.S: The people saying that Pakistanis are supremacist are wrong. We are religiously extremist. We won't live and won't let live when it comes to religion, but we are not racist."
618,ebl89jb,"I am doing that by being the total opposite of what westerners think Pakistani/Muslim women are like. Not acting all oppressed by my husband or male family members, shy, uneducated, dependent (at least I can act like one until I get some things settled to make me truly independent like I was in Pakistan) and the most important not being an extremist religion wise (not ramming my opinion down anybody's throat and being open to other's beliefs). That's how you can easily let others know that you aren't that different from them (only applies to people who aren't racist or bigots). "
619,e0xzk2p,"It is extremist to understand the words of our nurturing and beloved Khalifa in the cornering manner you've poorly portrayed them.
Sexual harassment can occur regardless of one's beliefs or manner of dress, and Muslim women are not excluded from being targets of such crimes.  To suggest Hazoor isn't aware of this phenomenon is absurd.

The inner virtues of modesty and chastity and the means taught to protect them within the teachings of Islam do not have as their primary purpose the stopping or elimination of sexual harassment.  The teachings are, as I said, to protect the virtues of modesty and chastity.  However, when something is true at its core, there will be layers and layers of nuanced benefits, and as such the teachings of Islam deter sexual harassment.  

For example, certain behaviors, attitudes, and clear signals by way of dress can increase or reduce the probability of being the target of wanton advances and even more aggressive forms like pressure tactics, blackmail, and outright rape.  Perceived easier victims will stand out from those considered hard targets and thus will have higher likelihood of being targeted.  Take for instance, a nun renowned for her righteousness, chastity, and fear of God.  Will a fornicating man make advances towards her or instead a woman of flirtatious attitude and sexually suggestive dress?  So, attitude, dress, and the way we present ourselves can act as a barrier or an invitation.  

As a reminder, I repeat this is only a secondary benefit and the primary purpose of the teachings is to protect the beautiful and attractive qualities of the innocent, that is, modesty and chastity."

And then there are others who attend because of tradition, etc but they don't necessarily know if they agree with all of it. 

Also - for people who assume Muslim women are oppressed and controlled - a friend of mine is Muslim and trust me - you can't push this chick around. 

Also - if you think for a moment there aren't  Christian women that are coerced into marriage, wearing certain clothes, behaving a certain way - well, you've never been to the Bible Belt.

It makes sense. Islam allows 4 women to share an Alpha. This means for every 1 ""Alpha"", 3 men are incels. So the 3 incels are sent to Jihad, blow themselves up etc. The remaining society is heavily populated by women, and so all the rules of society that the remaining ""Alphas"" make must naturally cater to the overwhelming majority of females. Including throwing more incel men to die to win more spoils for the women back home. Similarly, scientists describe lion packs as ""Matriarchal"" too (10 lioness to 1 lion?)

They also told me the main force driving back Feminism in these Muslim extremist places, is Muslim women themselves.

Muslim parents will only allow their daughters to be with a man who is a doctor or engineer (they justify it by saying man must take care of wife in Islam). Meanwhile if a woman sleeps around they say forgive her past, because that's what you do in Islam. You're not allowed to marry multiple women either, and many Muslim women get married late nowadays as well, and some refuse to do housework. 

Many Muslim women in the west want all the benefits of an Islamic society (Husband who provides for her, has a house or apartment ready before he even touches her) with none of the responsibility (being chaste, not having boyfriends, getting married young).

This can also apply to Indian and Hindu women as well, I see similar behavior from them, they date trashy men in younger years then expect to marry a beta brown boy who she wont even touch unless he has a good degree and and his own place to stay. Women are the same regardless of race, don't believe the myth that Asian/Brown/etc. women are more docile, they are like that in their home countries because they heavily depend on men for sustenance, once they set foot on American soil they reveal their true selves.

I think it comes down to this, really. Again, I think we need spaces for discussions about all sorts of political stuff including criticism of Islamic ideology (providing the discussion stays civil and well sourced). However, r/news is just for discussing the news; not for extreme speculation, so this argument does not apply. Those comments should deleted per the rules.

Oh no, I wasn't even talking about anything you'd said personally' my comment was in response for you're advocation for complete free-speech in regards to r/news as a moderated space. In fact, I have alway been critical of Islam as an ideology along with religion as a general concept. I think - within our modern setting - it has a regressive effect on culture and social progression, and I'm aware that there is an inherent rape-culture found in any genuinely strict abrahamic religious group. Furthermore, I don't doubt that young first-generation Islamic men are more likely to form rape-gangs due to their culture and religion; as would western men from 70/100 years ago.

I gave an example earlier in this thread of how our vice Prime Minister had to resign because it turned out the Green Party politician who were Minister of Housing and Urban Development had deep ties to a extremist Turkish Nationalism/Islamist group.

Another fine example is how the Swedish leftist party higher ups decided to basically accuse their own party member - a Muslim woman - for helping the ""racist narrative"" when she tried to highlight the issues with honor culture brewing in the suburbs with a large immigrant/Muslim population.

She tried to start a discussion about the fact that the Islamist who they fled from now are here, in the suburbs, harassing Muslim women in the streets who walk without a veil, that young Muslim women are being forced into marriage, and all the other crap that comes with the deeply patriarchal honor culture that ruled the countries their parents fled from.

She wrote opinion pieces, books and even started an organization to try help young women (and men) living in the suburbs. She's a member of the Leftists party (and a Marxist to boot). You'd think the Leftist party would be proud - but no, instead the party leadership wrote counter-opinion pieces against her, accusing her of helping the racists narrative, they tried to kick her out of the party - which failed because so many other Muslim women in the party stood up for her. 

When she was given the award ""Swede of the Year"", the Leftist party stayed completely silent - no congratulations, no ""wow our hard working party member won this award"", nope - complete radio silence... "
636,dimzgy2,"The *niqāb* is often not liked in many Islamic countries either and it has been banned in a few.  It is considered extremist even by many Muslims and it's often not widely worn in many Muslim countries.  The *niqāb* is a Salafi  Saudi export.

637,dhixm9h,"Firstly, you can't pick and choose who's freer based on Christianity. Also, if you're going to base an agreement on whether women are freer in one part of the world based on a particular religion, you can't just negate all the extremists........ if you take out allll the Muslim extremists, Muslim women are far freer than western women. So your point is invalid. 

Also, there shouldn't have to be a comparison or debate. Women should be treated equal to or better than men (we bare the brunt of bringing life in to the world so I posit that we should be treated WAY better but I will settle for equality and the government staying out of my vagina). So, there shouldn't be a debate, but there is.

Edit: I bring up negating extremism because you said main stream christianity. Firstly, what really is ""main stream"" and secondly because the book of myths that christians rely on is so old it almost calls for its practitioners to treat women as less than. "
638,dhj3eta,"""If you take out all the Muslim Extremists, Muslim women are far freer than Western Women""

If your definition of extremist is a man who uses religious doctrine to subjugate every woman in his social sphere, sexually, economically, educationally...then the removal of said extremists would leave a mostly female population in the vast majority of Muslim nations. Your point was beyond absurdity and factually incorrect.

Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Somalia, (we can go on)...all have accepted practices against women that are beyond disgust in Western cultures. Stop conflating rightful condemnation of horrible practices with arguments of neocolonialism, racism, and bigotry. 
"
639,dhopdfc,"&gt;But they do. All the time. Also in the West. It is not easy being a woman anywhere! And to assume that Muslim women are any less clever with men than western women are, is patronizing. Burqa up or down, we all know how strong women are, regardless of their clothes.

I know, but I do not see this as a question of cleverness. I see this as oppression, not as freedom. Of course women are able to suffer through oppression, but that doesn't mean that it should be encouraged to make women suffer. Or to provide others the means to. Freedom should be encouraged, and the ones that stand in the way of this freedom should not be given the means to keep oppressing women.

Though I am probably biased, because I do not see any need for extremist religious people coming here anyway. And would rather have them far away from here.

640,g0m4j9b,"The origins of the hijab is [Disturbing](https://sunnah.com/muslim/39/25) Basically Umar’s idea cuz he was spying on women who answered the call to nature (weirdo). Also, this hadith implies that Muslim women are supposed to cover from head to toe. “Veiling” in this case means to not even be recognized which is absolute proof that the face is to be covered. As far as why this isn’t the mainstream interpretation, it’s cuz Islam is so radical that even Muslims themselves gradually distance themselves from insane ideas over time; example is [Quran 65:4](https://quran.com/65/4). This verse clearly says a young girl would be allowed to get married even before puberty. Yet Muslims will still beat around the bush and tell you puberty is required.."

It varies country to country and I don't know international law.  I think it also varies by city versus village, and how devout versus radical (not the same thing) the local cleric is.

They consider all these hippie behaviors as haram, even Islamic women are convinced they are doing right by using hijab and obeying their husbands (trust me, they don't feel opressed at all). Things like abortion would be an absolute crime for them. And this is only based on the Islamic friends I've met on exchanges that are far from being fully Islamic. I don't want to imagine what radical Arabic islamists would think of their behavior, feminists would go crazy if they knew Arabic women wear Niqab or even Burqa.

644,fmd8kcj,"While I do agree with you, I think the main issue is it is hard to generalize practice to a group because of various sects and interpretations as well as who dictates what is culture and what isn't.

In the realm of religion, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, pretty much any form of religion falls prey to this. A total spectrum ranging from Atheist to religious radical and pretty much any flavor of religion in between exists and for all of those. 

Culture, as well, gets complicated due to some places having a culture that is set by perhaps a small group of people and/or attempting to tie culture to religion/etc. 

One example that comes to mind is Saudi Arabia. If you ask some people what Saudi/arab culture is, based on their exposure to this one country they might claim things like ""It doesn't let women drive and they must be covered up"" and similar things. They might even cite the quran like people love to do to prove a point. However, from who I've met a lot of people from Saudi do not identify with those things at all. To them, Saudi culture might be middle eastern food and clothes. Similarly, a lot of Muslim women are not wearing hijab, etc. 

I think what you said about respecting individuals is very true. I think it is important to also try to hear the full story about a culture or religion before condemning it because the news reports about the bad but rarely explains that it is one small portion of the truth."

&gt;So?

Alright, thats why I have a fucking problem??????!! You find nothing wrong becausr your probably a priviledged Muslim man who doesn't think for a second if he'd like living the life as a woman. I know two women in my life personally affected by this ruling. This is not something you can just shrug off, it makes so many women depressed: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782180/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782180/)

&gt;If a woman does not approve of her husband marrying anyone else she must put that into a contract before the marriage takes place.

Ah the solution, just put it in your contract! You realize this was never originally an Islamic thing. Contracts were oral and needed no papers like right now, it was just an oath for marriage and theres no hadith nor ayah that states that you can put conditions. But for the sake of argumentation lets say it is an actual Islamic thing, with origins from your prophet and Allah. This means that the default stance is that no permission is needed. But that begs the question, if putting conditions was allowed, how come so many muslim women from non-western countries are miserable yet involved in polygamy? Because they were never told that they could put conditions because it's not an actual thing.

&gt;What punishment and to whom? Usually when I have read about ""*free women* it has been referring to women who are not slaves.

I'm using figurative language holy shit. I said that the punishment applies to women who were not married nor the concubine of the man. What part of that is hard to understand? 

&gt;You know, there's more to marriage that just that.

And thats exactly what I said??? Are you that obtuse??

&gt;Do you mind bringing them *into* the discussion if you're going to keep on mentioning them?

Look, lemme explain to you in very easy words ok:

* Man has same amount of sex as a woman, but using sex slaves and extra wives as a vessel for cheating= no punishment
* Woman has same amount of sex, but is not legally allowed to have sex slaves or extra husbands so she resorts to other men who she is not married to = punishment

This literally means that the rulings are in favour of men. What do you not get about this?

&gt;No. Sexism is treating one sex as superior to another.

Its not, its the the mistreatment and discrimination of another sex, which usually involves not giving the same rights to the other sex, which exactly is what we have here. You really aren't gonna educate a radical feminist on the semantics behind the word sexism. But even according to your definition, Islam is still sexist because it offers men more rights under the idea that they are more perfect human beings with better intellect and strength and women are a form of fitnah (literally a source of corruption) and are just gossipy hags which birth babies out and forget things a lot.

&gt;Never said misery was only limited to Muslim women.

Saying muslim women are miserable does not imply others aren't. Where is the logic?

This isn't the time for semantics, which are all the arguments you provide."

I have personally witnessed and experienced infantilisation, manipulation, and dismissal at the hands of white radical feminists who refuse to consider how their politics are informed by a white-/Eurocentric stance. This needs to be confronted and white radical feminists need to be much more vigilant about how their whiteness can blind them to the way women of colour experience the world, and how they can reproduce ideas that strip women of colour of agency, and how their views can be incredibly racist but go undetected as they are masked beneath a faux “feminist” stance — eg. stances about how Muslim women must be “saved” and “liberated” from their religion with zero nuance and zero understanding and zero regard for the life experiences of Muslim women and completely dismissing anything Muslim women may have to say on the topic unless they are agreeing (then these Muslim women are tokenised and used as a gotcha against anyone who may not hold the same views), instead only imposing what THEIR idea of Islam is and reproducing extremely racist discourses. It is one thing to critique religion but I’ve noticed the way many white radfems do it is incredibly reductive and unproductive and falls back on racist tropes and that needs to be addressed, otherwise it does nothing to actually help the women in question, instead only silencing them which comes from an incredibly harmful position of a white saviour complex that has no place in radical feminism."

The American radical jihad at work."
652,ej31ja0,"Europe was always notorious for being introverted and culturally restrained. They were huge prudes and huge “lifestyle conservatives” before the US and it’s culture came, sometimes around the World Wars, and loosened them up. 

Everyone’s making good points about this, but I’d like to mention another point here: Europeans have an old-world foundation for a lot of their beliefs. Their views of conservatism and even religion include strong lifestyle components like sexual prudery, government control, and a general cultural introversion. This isn’t as prevalent in the US, in most cases, not prevalent at all. 

Unlike Europe, the US developed without a lot of lifestyle politics and has had no periods of tyrannical rule. It’s views on religion are far more liberal than Europe’s when it comes to lifestyle. That even extends to Muslims: I had a hard time finding the study, but American Muslim women are far more likely to forego the Hijab and the Burqa relative to European Muslim women. 

Secondly, conservatism in the US is really only based on support for small government, and mainly shows up in fiscal policies. While both political parties have lifestyle viewpoints, you’re not as likely to find staunch “lifestyle conservatives” in the US as you are in Europe. 

On strictly fiscal/governmental issues, the US tends to be more conservative. On lifestyle, the US tends to be radically more liberal/libertarian. 

The European notion that the US is “sexually prudish”, for example, is directly backwards: pretty much all European nations have had far more engrained elements of sexual prudery in their cultures than the US has, and it’s the modern reaction to prior European values of a “staunch, introverted, stiff-upper-lip-having” character that causes Europeans to insist that it’s some bastion of liberalism compared to the US when it isn’t, at all. By comparison, the US’s tendency towards cultural extroversion and (unfortunately) very high beauty standards due to Hollywood, as well as a radical amount of free-speech protection means that obscenity laws and “content banning” is unheard of here, even though it is commonly practiced in Europe. 

American culture tends to be radically sexualized. And I’d say Americans are far more direct and honest about sexuality than Europeans, and this is largely historical as well. Europeans were grappling with fascism and syndicalism while the US was developing a radically more liberal culture, that was in part a response to repressed, parochial European values.

Parochial is the right word here. The British love to pretend they’re so open, but they’re “cultural image” was one of a nation of “uniformed, decorum-obsessed prudes”, and that image fits British culture today far more than it does American, though I’ve heard Britons insist otherwise. 

Similarly, the European powers (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK) essentially viewed the US as a nation full of “vulgar, violence, beauty-obsessed philistines”. Americans were looked at as “oversexed, overpaid, and over here” during WW2. 

That’s not to say the US doesn’t have bits of conservatism in some of its culture, but culturally, it’s by far and away one of the most liberal countries in the world, far outstripping any European nation. 

There usually arises some sort of vocal opposition to this radical cultural liberalism, but just because there’s some sort of religious opposition class doesn’t mean America’s cultural is somehow really conservative. 

TL;DR The notion of American prudery or lifestyle conservatism is a backwards projection of old European values onto modern American society, by modern Europeans. America has always been a more “socially liberal” place, tbh. Talking to the citizens alone will prove that. Americans are open, extroverted, and loud, Europeans typically quiet, introverted, and very restrained. "
653,ejh0232,In my experience I have found that Muslim women are more radical and bigoted than Muslim Men. I had perceived it to be otherwise due to Media and Popular Culture. I can fully understand how OP must have felt aghast at their views. 
654,ekv3vqy,"It sounds like you're expecting the ""generic social justice"" intersectionality here, and radfem intersectionality is something completely different. This is a **woman-centered** space. Radfem intersectionality is about recognizing women's experiences, even when they somewhat differ based on racial/cultural differences, as long as this still ties back into manifestations of sexism. 

The examples you're giving are instances of non-white men being oppressed for their race (because men are never oppressed for their sex), and are thus out of the relevant scope of this subreddit. The New Zealand shooting, while a tragedy that's clearly a result of bigotry, has nothing to do with gender criticism/radical feminism, so why the expectation it would be covered here, other than as result of an implicit expectation of women doing emotional labor for everyone who's disadvantaged in any way. Liberal feminism going out of its way to include such discussions and problem under its umbrella is precisely the reason why it's become so diluted in the first place, and ended up putting the concerns of women on the backburner. 

If Muslim women are offended over Muslim men being criticized, what's the difference between that and white women being offended by their fellow white men being criticized, speaking purely from the position of protecting women's interests? It's the same manifestation of identification with men over women. From a radical feminist position, Muslim men oppress Muslim women to an incredible, pernicious degree, and thus it seems an oxymoron that criticizing Muslim men and their religious indoctrination into the idea they are and are meant to be the dominant sex is seen as criticizing Muslim women. Same as sex-based oppression of women manifests somewhat differently in different parts of the world influenced by other factors, so does sexist entitlement in men. All men are entitled in this sense, but in a different way, and sometimes to different degrees, depending on other factors. White women are allowed to observe Muslim men as entitled and sexist, as well as to recognize how the religion they subscribe ties in with that, because all women are encouraged and allowed to see that all men are entitled and sexist, and recognize the contributing factors to that."

I know some ex-Muslim women are ok with white women championing these issues, saying it's a religion thing rather than race thing but radical Islam is a racialized religion. So, many of the brown women I've spoken to are wary of white women discussing it. I don't have issue with white women discussing Brunei but when I see some of them using it as confirmation bias that all Muslims are backwards and using neo-con sources I'm somewhat wary. Some white radfems have been seen parroting white nationalists in regards to this so I think it's normal for us to be a little wary, do they actually care about brown women or are they just like the white radfems in the 1900s who wanted equality for white women only while being racist towards black/brown women?"
656,ei0x3j2,"You are going to every sub to advocate for the hijab you clearly have an agenda and this is an anti feminist one. You seem not to understand how ridiculous you sound to the people here and how little we care about your post modernist like ""post-colonial"" words that are supposed to frighten us. We see those for what they are, words that men use to justify sexism in their own culture.

The hijab is a sexist form of oppression. That women ""choose"" (it is not a choice when your religion and your patriarchal culture has been thrown upon you since your birth) to participate in their own oppression doesn't make it less terrible it just make the oppression sadder.

You also seem to be misguided if you think we think only muslim women are oppressed. Every culture is patriarchal, every men in their own culture have found different ways to oppress women. We do not give a fuck which men of whichever colors or races or culture oppress women and their different petulant way to do so. They all are the same to us.

Women in every culture are forced to participate in patriarchal rituals or they are either shuned or jailed or raped etc men lack no means to oppress women. 

Women are socialised with those patriarchal rules. Some of them accept they are second class human beings, others rebel. A woman accepting her situation as a second class human being does not make it right. Some women think buying into patriarchal shemes will buy them peace or bring them some recognition from the men in their culture and so they will be treated better.

We radical feminists think this is an illusion, never women have obtained anything by submitting to men or keeping quiet or obeying their patriarchal cultural rules. Not only muslim women, every women of every cultures. 

This is because we consider every women our equals that we are against the veil not because we think muslim women are dumber and the only ones to follow their own patriarchal culture.

We are against every religions as they are all sexist and written by men for the benefice of men and the subjugation of women.

Go make your islamist propaganda elsewhere, we just see you for what you are here and we dont give a single fuck about your religion.

The hijab is also worn by muslim women who grew up in non-islamic countries too so bring up lack of education and legal rights is irrelevant. It's dehumanizing to know the meaning behind it. In the quran it is mentioned as a thing to prevent sexual harassment from men.   
&gt;  
&gt;The hijab isn't a choice in islam because it's compulsory. Every time a women is not covered properly she is sinning and will burn in hell for a period of time. Family pressure, societal pressures and in some countries the law forces women to wear the hijab.

659,eb9ct31,"You act like fighting in MMA is an epidemic among Muslim women?

As for working in general, women see the need to work because men are doing less nowadays. Muslim men have been conquered and defeated by non-Muslim men and, in general, have shirked responsibilities in terms of seeking education, behaving well (personally and towards others), and seeking gainful careers/employment. The political defeats from the 18th-20th centuries mean even things like jihad are out of the question now. 

The only saving grace for Muslim men is when they struggle to provide for their families. But shirking responsibilities because you're not in control is not the kind of struggle we're talking about. Just being poor is not the struggle we're talking about. Hanging out with buddies and joining radical political groups or resorting to petty crime or whatever is tough, sure, and a struggle, yes, but not the kind we're talking about. Going day after day to seek interviews and gainful, halaal employment is what we're talking about. Even if you starve and die in that state.

Not to mention this is all a cultural issue as well. Many Muslim men, even those with good careers, have shirked religion altogether. Sometimes because of the time they've devoted to their career paths.

Muslim men are lacking so much that Muslim women are *still* birthing and rearing families, learning deen and teaching their families *and* now also financially supporting them. Like... have men ever done all that? They can't, because they can't give birth. So what women are doing today (literally everything) is unprecedented in human history and, imho, a foreboding sign of qiyamat.

If you don't want the women to work, step up and make it so they don't have to.

By work I mean work to support. Obviously everyone has different talents and if a women has a particular ability/talent/knowledge which benefits her society, her man and family should enable her to contribute on that basis alone, so she can ""work"" but without the stress associated of supporting your family (which usually means working non-stop and neglecting other things as opposed to finding a way to squeeze in work as a secondary priority)."

Because from what I've seen women who wear veils are treated exactly the same as white/Western sex workers are.

&gt;Secondly, that article doesn't offer a defense of Islam.

The article doesn't, but it doesn't address the fact that feminists defend Islam, which is the reason for Peterson's outrageous statement.

&gt;It's not surprising that feminists would oppose the harassment of Muslim women based on what they wear or look like.

It's strange that they would address that and not the fact that the vast majority of Muslim women are born into the religion, are not allowed to leave the religion under penalty of social ostracizing (and even death in some places), and they HAVE to wear the hijab so men don't go crazy with lust over them; that's about the most sexist thing imaginable.

&gt;Feminists tend to oppose the marginalization and oppression of women in general, not just women who share our ideological beliefs.

Then why do they support the hijab? Yea it CAN be ""empowering"" if done so by personal choice, but in the vast majority of cases it is not.

&gt;Thirdly, even if that article did offer a defense of Islam, one doesn't have to reach far to find an explanation for why its author defends Islam: she's Muslim.

Which means she follows a religion that oppresses women, she's more of a sexist than Peterson in this regard.

&gt;I suspect she's Muslim because she was born into and raised by a Muslim family, not because she has a subconscious desire for brutal male domination

She supports a religion that brutally subjugates women, I wonder what would compel her to do that if she claims to care about the rights of women.

I will look into these publications as I was not aware of them, thanks for sharing the info."
666,e02qn2r,Muslim women are raped but then killed by their own f being raped. For every case you mention for persecution against a Muslim women theres 5x that number of suicide attacks. Nobody else blows themselves up do they? Things are not equal. Radical Islam is violent and vindictive
667,e0q7plo,"Thank you! Reddit has a bizarre hate booner for the Gulf states but they are making so much progress, especially recently, they should be encouraged, not hated on. It's crazy the amount of misinformation thrown towards the Gulf states, usually driven by the same people who conveniently lump all Muslims together. There's like 40+ million people in the Gulf (not counting Yemen, cuz then it's 65 ish million), then one day a handful of ISIS psychopaths decide to throw gays off roofs, and suddenly all Gulf Muslims are guilty by association. And of course all Muslim women are being oppressed, and stoned every day in the streets of Doha and Riyadh. /s

MBS is doing amazing work on shutting down the more ""old-fashioned"" (aka asshole) clerics and I hope he will soon be king, he kinda is already anyway, in terms of the real power. These clerics are getting the message anyway, and the people are not really with them. Like everywhere else, Saudis and Qataris and Emiratis just want good lives, good jobs, the men respect women.. why wouldn't they? We are their mothers, sisters, and daughters. People criticizing MBS's dictatorial tendencies tend to be the same people who invent and exagerate stuff about Muslim human rights and oppression to begin with, which is hilariously hypocritical, considering a dictator is exactly what's needed right now to finally shut down the crazies and cement pro-women and generally pro-Western reforms. What do critics want? A soft leader who will be run over by the radical clerics, thus making literally no progress? It's stupid and hypocritical coming from the people demanding action on human rights when this action is being provided at a really fast pace."
668,dy4ns4x," I thought that the article title was perhaps highly editorialized (often non-Muslim women are forced to become wives of ISIS fighters), but nope:

&gt;They are said to have been in a northern Iraqi jail in Kurdish Erbil before returning. German federal prosecutors claim the women are radical Islamists

These women will raise their kids to hate Europeans and everything that Europe stands for. What a big mistake on Germany's part. "
669,dz9z6yc,"&gt; Also, if Muslim men don't marry non Muslim women to forcefully convert them, then why are Muslim women forbidden?


Muslim women are not less ""allowed"" to outmarry according to their religion than Jewish women. The difference is mostly due to cultural patterns of Islamic groups. It happens too among many Hindu South Asians and non-Muslim Kurds.

In the late XIXth century, Jewish women who left the community to marry Ukrainian/Russian men could be kidnapped or killed by members of the Jewish community. 


If a person freely agrees to convert to a religion, it's not a forced conversion. 



&gt; Even among the secular majority of Israeli Jews? 

Yes. Jewishness according to the state of Israel is defined by having a Jewish mother or a formal Orthodox conversion. 


&gt; And why would the Jewish community be more okay with its women marrying men of a very oppressive and sexist religion, but not okay with a woman from the very oppressive religion joining their Jewish community through a man?


It's not about being more ok. One happens and the other doesn't.  

A Muslim born Arab woman will not be part of the Jewish community even if she's married to a Jewish man same with her children. The child of a Muslim man and a Jewish woman could be accepted in one of the two groups. 

Israeli Jews while less religious are at least  (if not more tribalistic) than Arabs. 


Among Israeli Jews, Haredim (which are growing) are comparable to Palestinian Muslims when it comes to woman's treatment. They don't marry outmarry but they have a lot of power with the complicity of many non-Orthodox Jews. 



&gt; Even among the secular majority of Israeli Jews?


Yes. Sometimes ""secular"" people can be more radical proper religious ones. I've come across secular American Jews feeling offended because other American Jews were putting up a Christmas tree in December. Please note that many secular Israeli Jews are less secular than their American counterparts. 

It's more about tribalism than about religious practices. 



I live in France a country with both a large Muslim community and a Jewish community. I've never seen a Jewish man/Muslim woman couple as well as a Jewish man expressing a special attraction/desire to marry a Muslim woman or the opposite. 

Jews in France are pretty secular and Westernised but still care about their religion. Intermarriage is de facto ""allowed"" (no honour crime or similar) but socially prescribed."
670,dwa33rl,"because you are painting a poor picture of the matter that doesn't help solve the situation at hand. Becuase by what you are saying the solution is to get rid of islam. But when you look deeper, by many different metrics (employement, education, political engagement, etc) muslim women are doing quite well for developing countries in most major muslim countries: indonesia, turkey, malaysia, egypt, nigeria, china, morocco, tunisia, albania, bosnia. 

A lot of the countries where there are major issues stems from two things: education(pakistan, afghanistan) or extreme governments (saudi, iran). When the are instances of these things happening like acid throwing it comes from very uneducated and often brainwashed folks, either living in really rural and tribal areas or part of gangs.

Now these folks might try to rationalize their actions by coming up with or following some radical made up religious opinion (this is no doubt a problem that wahabbis have been spreading to different parts of the world and needs to be addressed (and most muslims want addressed)), but to label it as the religion as a whole is not genuine and wont lead to actual solutions/resolutions. "
671,duxpttk,"That's a really exaggerated view on Islamic communities. Most Muslim women are not oppressed. When it comes to hijab or dress codes they think it's best to dressed modestly without getting sleazy stares from random men.

In area where women are forced to wear certain dresses they get used to it. 

And there are many versions of Islam, some of those versions are not radical and women don't feel that it opresses them so they believe in it."
672,dvwv0u8,"We're radical feminists capable of making up our own minds about things. We shouldn't let the arguments used by right-wing men or left-wing men determine what we think and say about this issue. As it happens, Muslim and ex-Muslim women are themselves divided, and I think you missed an opportunity to link to some of the debate happening among actual Muslims about veils, the wearing and banning thereof. "
673,ds67l3l,"&gt; So now muslim women are all insane?

No, but the ones who seem to like being treated as property might not be as mentally healthy as they should be. 

I think it might help to not be so obtuse. It's the radical Sharia Law spouting fuck crumpets that are the problem. "

**The opposite of ‘divide and rule’, it is also PM Modi’s mission statement** 

 ______ 
** By MJ Akbar   
**

It is unsurprising that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is an avowed
disciple of Swami Vivekananda, should have placed gender reform at the heart
of governance. The passage of a

triple talaq bill

in Lok Sabha and the reinstitution of pilgrimage rights for Muslim women are
strong inclusive links in a chain that started within weeks of Modi taking
office in 2014. Vivekananda famously described Muhammad as the Prophet of
equality in race, caste, colour and gender. It took a disciple to remember
that.

Gender emancipation was central to Vivekananda's vision of a New India - a
symbol of national regeneration that he placed into public discourse. ""The
best thermometer to the progress of a nation is its treatment of its women,""
said Vivekananda. ""When woman is no longer oppressed,"" he added during umpteen
sermons, ""she will become a lion."" He even wanted women to become partners in
sacred space, a radical proposition in an age where priesthood had become the
jealously guarded preserve of men. Analysing the past, he argued that India
began to regress when women were turned into an ""object of blame for
everything"". In his cosmic and temporal view, the first manifestation of God
was the hand that rocked the cradle.

The wheels of change set in motion by Modi in 2014 are on course towards a new
horizon. Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas is a doctrine of inclusion, seeking to bring
all those who are marginalised because of inherited problems like caste,
creed, gender or wealth into the arc of prosperity and social liberation.
'Sab' does not merely include women; women are central to this narrative,
which believes that they can play a decisive role in elimination of that
historic curse, harsh poverty.

The starting point was Jan Dhan, the project that opened bank accounts for
over 300 million people who had never seen the inside of a bank before.

Jan Dhan

minimised the role of middlemen with their sticky fingers in direct benefit
transfers, an endemic problem that had substantially depleted actual resources
meant for the impoverished.

A transformative element of Jan Dhan's design was opening the banking system
to women who had never seen the inside of a bank before. About 53% of the Jan
Dhan accounts or over 162 million, were opened by women at the urban or rural
base of the economic pyramid. For the first time women from Dalit, tribal and
backward class communities who were struggling for a living, had found the
means for an economic empowerment project whose full implications would become
clear at next stage: collateral-free MUDRA loans.

Sensing opportunity and encouraged by government, women took an astonishing
75% of the total number of Mudra loans to start their own small enterprises,
worth well over Rs 2 lakh crore. In the last two years, women of the poorest
families also received another Rs 51,000 crore from the

National Rural Livelihoods Mission

. The PM's housing plan for the impoverished has a trigger clause: a woman
head of family can get a loan in her name. But a man must share ownership of
the house with his wife, unless he is a widower or bachelor.

Schemes to improve the health and welfare of women have become signature
landmarks of the Modi government.

Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

has improved rural sanitation coverage from 71% to 93% while 1,472 cities have
become Open Defecation Free. Separate toilets for girls are being built in all
government schools. In his Independence Day speech of 2014, Modi startled the
country by talking about the impact of absent toilets on women's health.

Every pregnant woman and lactating mother (apart from those receiving help
within the organised sector) now gets maternity benefits. This has the
collateral advantage of persuading mothers to register births, leading to
immunisation, life-saving vaccinations and better healthcare. The just amended
Maternity Benefit Act extends maternity leave to 26 weeks, and ensures that
every company with more than 50 employees has creche facilities.

More than 3.12 crore indigent women have received free LPG connections,
releasing them from the drudgery and danger of smoke-choked kitchens. This
number will keep growing. Physical security of women is a major priority.
Institutional mechanisms have been created like One Stop Centres; Nirbhaya
Fund has been expanded; compensation for victims has been enhanced; railways
is working to provide 24-hour security through CCTV at over 900 stations.

Government is pushing for more women in police forces to help victims of
violence; eight states have ensured 33% reservation for women in police. A
programme called Gender Champion to encourage gender sensitivity among the
young is now part of the curriculum of 100 universities and 145 colleges. The
PM has personally led the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao initiative, to address the
child sex ratio and promote education for girls so that they can become equal
claimants for jobs.

Justice for SC/STs and OBCs is another area where legislation, coupled with
administrative action, works towards social justice and economic inclusion.
The list of welfare schemes is long. Nor has government hesitated to take
tough measures in the interest of the vulnerable.

Our social history is replete with division, along the familiar lines of caste
and creed, which our colonial masters were quick to exploit. Unfortunately,
this inheritance of 'divide and rule' seeped rather quickly after freedom into
our democratic polity, encouraged by the first beneficiaries of political
power. Gender remained what might be called the 'silent division'. Modi is
multiplying gender opportunity to end this comparative exclusion of women
through social and economic empowerment.

Sometimes the meaning of a phrase acquires sharper clarity through the mirror
image. The opposite of 'divide and rule' is, quite obviously, 'unite and
serve'. 'Unite and serve' is Modi's mission statement.

675,dsxoo05,"Just like radical feminism, racial analysis uses a class lens. Not *every* individual white woman has a better or easier life than every individual non-white woman, but as a class, we do. Furthermore, racial privilege and gender/sex privilege are two different things. White women are privileged by race but disadvantaged by sex.  (Black men, for example, are privileged by their sex but disadvantaged by race). 

We're talking about contemporary times, not the Ottoman empire nor the 1800s, AKA the last time Irish people in diaspora were systematically oppressed, so I'm only going to address those examples.

&gt;Are east European girls subject to human trafficking and pimping to this very day, privileged?  

They're victims of sexism, not racism. In European brothels, they're targeted for rape (by their fellow Europeans, largely white ""johns."")  In other continents, non-white women are targeted. Nepali girls fill the brothels of India, Korean and East Asian women are held in bondage in countless ""massage parlors"" in North and South America.  

&gt;Do the underage white girls and children in Western Europe, targeted by Muslims for sexual assault, benefit from privilege? 

They're victims of sexism (assault by men) but benefit from privilege in other arenas of their lives, such as civil liberties, salaries, and employment opportunities as compared to non-white people.

Race DNE religion. Many European Muslims are white, such as Bosniaks and Albanians. Furthermore, Muslim women are more likely to be sexually assaulted by their fellow Muslim men than non-Muslim women, because sexual assault occurs mostly in the home. Finally and most importantly, white girls and children are oppressed by their sex, not by their race. White women who report sex crimes receive more attention from police than non-white women. If assaulted, they have a racial advantage in navigating the legal system. This is even true in some white-minority societies such as India. I've lived there, travelled alone, and been assaulted there. IME, passersby and the Indian police take the sexual assault of a white woman much more seriously than the assault of a local woman. I got more stares than local women but based on my Indian friends' experiences, less actual groping and touching. People would go out of there way to direct me to safety.

&gt;Do we not also deserve credit for all the good things that white people have achieved, namely in technology and science?

WTF? That's like claiming the laudable accomplishments of men mean that patriarchy isn't real and men don't benefit from it.

&gt;As for white women being portrayed as the most desirable, ie the most objectified, do you really think that’s a privilege?

Because of the normalization of white beauty standards, white women generally report higher self-esteem then women of color.  We can both agree that universal beauty standards and objectification are sexist, vile and affect all women. However, I'd argue being most conventionally attractive does not equal most objectified, because men objectify and fetishize women of all races. What about the ""hot Latina mama""? The ""passive submissive Asian""? The ""animalistic African""?  and other fetishes?


PS:  The men and women who voted for Trump don't face ""a constant target for hatred just for being white,"" but for voting for a misogynist racist who admittedly sexually assaults women. "
676,dsrb159,"Whether it is or isn't racial is academic in my view. This is the reality we're dealing with right now. It's also heightened by the state of the political landscape. The State, academia and the media all stoke up minority resentment -- historical and contemporary -- and victim hood thus causing more minorities to vote for parties that are willing to form minority coalitions and cater to their interests like the Democrats and Labour. I see no reason that this phenomenon is going away and every indication that the pattern will intensify. 

As for Islam well there's good evidence that actually second and third generation young Islamic men are getting FAR more radical than their immigrant ancestors in Europe. I see no answer to these problems contained within Liberalism. "
677,dpg7ttg,"You're right... radical liberals also will not admit that Islamic women are mistreated, for fear of not being politically correct in ""respecting"" all religions. These types are so mentally ill. Unfortunately though, with regard to rapists, while some do get ""taken care of"" by the prison population, I'm sure most go untouched and get through their light sentences with little discomfort. But please listen... not all men are rapist scum like that. Plenty of them are animals, yes, but it's not the norm. I hope you find the peace that you so desire."
678,do2iajz,"&gt; If you look at France, you see that the Arab girls are really loose over there compared to their counterparts in North Africa  Each generation that comes after the other loses touch with their religion and embrace degeneracy instead.

Some of the girls become looser, but the men become ever more ""radical"" (in truth, just more genuinely Islamic) in response.  Muslims are becoming more Islamic over time in Western countries, not less.  In fact, Muslims in moderate Muslim countries have been becoming more Islamic, as the relative power of the West decreased.  

For example, 1956, President of Egypt laughing at Muslim Brotherhood and their desire for all women to be made to wear hijabs:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4RK8bj2W0

By 2011, the Muslim Brotherhood had overthrown the government and stayed power until 2013.
  "
679,dpvh48c,"&gt; People in the West should ""know better"" than those heathen barbarians in the Middle East.

To the SJWs, Muslims are primarily victims of Western imperialism and white Christians (or atheists) couldn't possibly understand the cultural differences between Muslims and non-Muslims. 

Today in class we debated Quebec's face-cover ban and whether it was justified and compatible with the values of a liberal democracy. Islam came up and interestingly the only person arguing against the religion (besides me) was a Muslim girl who was skeptical about whether Muslim women are freely choosing to wear the niqab/burqa or not. 

Most white people defended the religion while at the same time admitting that they don't know anything about it. I wonder if they had done the same if we had talked about a marginalized political group, like radical leftists or neo-nazis? "
680,dmlx7ja,"Muslim women are more often unemployed than Christian etc by choice. (Or choice of their husbands)

There will be no discrimination. In fact, it's likely that a muslim will be on the board that interviews you since they are over-represented in the medical field.

Some of the things you say make me believe you are only hearing about Western Society from biased sources that only give the worst case incidents.

No one at the NHS is going to fear you're a radical just for wearing hijab. 

"
681,dmoi1ke,"&gt; They are exactly the same as conservative Muslim men, and will do everything up to and including killing other women for going against the religion. They're usually a lot more proactive with violence against women than men are, actually.

This is the most ignorant thing I've read in a while. 

Radical Muslim women are not saints but it's disingenuous and downright stupid to deny that the problems of radical Islam stem from men and that they have control. "
682,dlms355,"""Gender deviant radical feminists"" lmao ok

An answer popped into my head the second I read the title and reading this only confirmed it. Islam isn't the problem, Muslim men are. The world is patriarchal, women are expected to let men take the lead and be nothing more than followers. We do need feminism when a bunch of old men (hello, Congress!) try to dictate what we can and can't do with our bodies as women. We need feminism because men are trying to tell women how to feel (which is what you've just done) and above all, to shut up and be submissive. We need feminism because a solid deal of Muslim men will be complete hypocrites and twist Islam to their benefit, often simply to screw over women. I mean, we had a post a few days ago about what we'd like to say to Muslim men. Could you not have read that instead?

You need to shake this idea of a ""liberal turban wearing hijabi that thinks God is a woman"" narrative that High on Liberal Islam has pushed into your skull. Do you seriously think any more than a tiny, TINY percentage of Muslim women are like that? We're not reinterpreting anything, we're asking men to not twist God's word to benefit their misogynist agenda. 

Also, this sub is, from what I understand, a safe space for women. It's really intrusive when men come in and make more or less hostile posts. You came here looking for a pat on the back and validation and you will get neither. "
683,dm0h75g,"I never made a 1% comment. And your comment regarding how the middle east was 50 years ago only furthers my point that its not so much a religious issue (considering the people were and still are muslim) but corruption in government and leadership. Look at ALL 1st world and developing nations. Most, Islamic or not, have the similarities you mention of violence, corruption, intolerance, etc. There's a common denominator here and I don't think that is a religious one.

I'm a Muslim, born and raised in the West with ethnic ties to the middle east. When I deal with my community here in the West, I don't see a glimpse of intolerance or violence. There is a big Islamic awakening/movement that is disassociating itself with the Islam of the ME. Muslim women are coming into power, we no longer associate piety with garment and beard length, we don't turn away gay muslims from the community, we are involved in local activities and city council. I know and understand that there is a BIG problem with the ME and radical Islamic uprising, but in order to solve this problem, we need to truly understand why they are that way. Why is the movement not prevalent in places like Lebanon? Hell, even parts of Syria can be considering ""enlightened."" I see a lot of parallels between the USA in regards to big city-vs small country town mentalities. Its known that small country towns tend to be more intolerant and more conservative considering their like-mindedness and lack of diversity. The ME has a big ""village"" population where there is no education, no diversity, and most of all, no social interactions with other backgrounds. This is why Lebanon, a religiously diverse and home to the best universities in the ME, don't have the same troubles as say, Iraq or Syria. However, drive into the small little villages in Lebanon, you'll find some of the radical mentality... however it is no where near as bad as other places in the ME. It's slowly happening, but the cultural shift in the ME is happening and secularism, education, tolerance, and non-violence will be mainstream soon enough. 

P.S. Even Syria and Iraq are very good examples. Both are secular states, with the same issues you mentioned (Bashar isn't really a traditional Muslim, he's an Alawite). However, if you go to the capitals, Damuscus, or even to Allepo, people are very different than what you'll find in the surrounding villages (which there are  a lot of). "
684,difou34,"50% of all muslim men in the UK are on welfare, 75% of all muslim women are on welfare (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8054403/Britains-coping-classes-at-breaking-point.html) which costs us £8.6 billion a year ($11 billion). All paid for by the hardworking british taxpayers who go to work everyday to give up half of their paycheck (to taxes) for these people. The people who have more children than any other group. Muslims have 10 kids, while we on average have 2 or 3, not to mention they are allowed 4 wives (at once), which means even more money from the hardworking british taxpayers, many muslims are making 6 figures and living in half a million pound houses ($750k) by sitting and doing nothing (other than popping out kids) all paid for by US! who go out to work everyday struggling to get by.. Not to mention the 20,000 radical islamic jihadists living in the UK, which is one thing, but what really pisses me off even more is they abuse and exploit our democracy and tolerance, take our money from welfare and use it to get their hands on weapons/materials to kill us with.. The people that have given them everything, the police and government who would rather side with them and blame us. Rant over..
"
685,djdj3lb,"&gt;An increasing amount of people think that eating meat is wrong to begin with

Actually, this is wrong.  According to Gallup polls, the number of vegetarians has remained stable for almost the last 20 years, but appears to have plateaued with no net growth according to Pew Studies, with vegans having only grown 1% in that time.  What this tells me at least is that either you're not really looking at reliable figures, or looking at figures at all.

""Vegetarianism in the U.S. remains quite uncommon and a lifestyle that is neither growing nor waning in popularity. The 5% of the adult population who consider themselves to be vegetarians is no larger than it was in previous Gallup surveys conducted in 1999 and 2001. The incidence of veganism is even smaller, at a scant 2% of the adult population.""

--Frank Newport (2012).  In U.S., 5% Consider Themselves Vegetarians.  Gallup.  Retrieved from:  http://www.gallup.com/poll/156215/consider-themselves-vegetarians.aspx

--Cary Funk and Brian Kennedy (2016).  Public views about Americans’ eating habits.  Pew Research Center.  Retrieved from: http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/12/01/public-views-about-americans-eating-habits/

I'm sorry, but it's not like vegetarianism or veganism is this fast growing demographic.  In fact, most people place vegans and vegetarians with other stereotypically annoying demographics, like atheists and cross fitters, hence the following joke: ""An atheist, a cross fitter, and a vegetarian walk into a bar.  I only know because they won't stfu about it.""  An alternative punch line to the joke is ""they only told everyone in the bar within five minutes.""  In fact, it seems that for every one person who becomes a vegan or vegetarian year to year, there's another person who leaves.  

&gt;even more people think that the method of slaughter used when killing the animal is barbaric and unnecessarily tortures the animal even more than conventional slaughtering

I find this difficult to believe, particularly when most Americans have no idea where their food comes from or how it gets from farm to supermarket.  In fact, the only demographics I've ever seen actually care are people who have their own PR issues and trouble recruiting, like vegans, vegetarians, atheists, and rad cons.  Vegans and vegetarians have a vested interest in being opposed to any use of animal products as ""barbaric,"" and of the atheists who care, they represent a small minority of the overall demographic, apparently only one-in-ten atheists.  It would also be unconstitutional to implement any law which punished someone of one religion or favoring members of another.  Recall that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment is still a thing, and most of the time, these law suits don't go in favor of the government.

--Michael Lipka (2016).  10 facts about atheists.  Pew Research Center.  Retrieved from: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/01/10-facts-about-atheists/

&gt;Attitudes towards religions (especially organized ones with complex laws, such as Orthodox Judaism and Islam) are increasingly more critical and/or hostile.

Perhaps in demographics that have traditionally always been critical of Judaism or Islam, and with the rise of social media people have been getting louder, but the number of people hasn't been getting bigger.

&gt;Muslims have no political say whatsoever in the West to begin with and hostility to Islam and what it advocates is also on the rise among both the right and the left.

Perhaps with regard to ISIL, and again in groups that have historically been critical of Judaism and Islam, but no this certainly is not the case.  The religious right in the United States has always been against anything which isn't Evangelical or at least Catholic, and the left hasn't shown any major leanings against Islam.  In fact, when President Trump signed an executive order which banned travel to a handful of middle eastern countries, the left was in an uproar calling it a Muslim Ban.  That doesn't sound like ""increasing hostility"" to me, and the left has been getting louder against what it considers to be xenophobic sentiments in the past.

It should also be noted that according to Pew studies, Muslim birth rate in the West is up, while American Christian birth rate is down.  If it holds for long enough, and America is still around by then, it stands to reason that at some point, there will be fewer angry white conservatives yelling about how Islam is the devil, and just as many atheists and vegetarians and vegans yelling as there always have been.

--Michael Lipka (2015).  Muslims expected to surpass Jews as second-largest U.S. religious group.  Pew Research Center.  Retrieved from: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/muslims-expected-to-surpass-jews-as-second-largest-u-s-religious-group/

&gt;Muslims have no political say whatsoever in the West to begin with

This actually isn't true, and it's worth noting that Muslims don't vote as a continuous voting block, where they all want and vote for the same things.  But they do the have the right to vote in this country, hold service in the military, hold government office, and serve in jury duty.  As long as they're naturalized citizens of the United States, the Constitution promises them this much at least.

&gt;hostility to Islam and what it advocates is also on the rise among both the right and the left.

Except different Muslims advocate for different things, and there are just as many interpretations of what Islam is. 

&gt;societies with a secular form of government have made illegal certain religious acts which society has deemed outrageous. A few examples that come to mind (particularly in the Western context) are the banning of the niqab and/or burqa in several European countries

Actually, these laws apply to public spaces and were amendments to pre-existing laws which forbade clothing which covered the face, including masks and certain types of hoodies.  The burqini has only been successfully banned in Corsica, France.  However, while anti-immigrant sentiment may have been behind the bannings, these laws only impact radical Muslims, not Muslims as a whole.  Muslim women are still permitted to wear the hijab, Qurans can still be purchased and sold in the United States and Europe, and mosques can still be built.  So I mean, that doesn't seem to be a huge difference from what it was like before.

&gt;not allowing Mormons to have multiple wives

Actually, those laws aren't generally enforced, unless someone is in some kind of danger.  The show ""Sister Wives"" wouldn't exist otherwise.  Sure, polygamy isn't legal in the US, but neither is jaywalking.

&gt;banning construction of new minarets.

...Which only happened in Switzerland as far as I can tell, and was not well respected by the rest of the United Nations as I recall.  In fact, they were sharply criticized for the ban by many of the same European countries that banned burqas in public places.  I mean, banning a burqa has a functional application, such that someone can be identified in public, but banning a minaret is just intolerance for its own sake.  I doubt the ban will last the test of time.

But to close this point off, I also don't think these things are tied in any meaningful way to the sale of Halal or Kosher meats, much less that they'll lead to that.  I would tend to think if anything, acceptance of Jews and Muslims would increase with time."
686,dhim0bu,"Society does in the same way Islamic women are 'forced' to wear a headscarf. When did the right become radical feminists all of a sudden, though?"
687,dhbg1u9,"&gt; Muslim women are supportive of their men who rape white women, are cruel and sadistic, and have never suffered to any serious degree at the hands of Europeans.

Eh that's just bullshit, maybe a few radical ones think that way. Why would the average Muslim woman think that? Because they're insane? It's a stupid as hell thing to claim."
688,dhwyvg4,"It reminds me of the story of a snake and a woman that Donald Trump reads all the time. 

It won't be long when radical Islam turns against Feminism. Interestingly enough, there is a new catch phrase feminists started reciting recently especially in UK and Australia - Muslim women are the true feminists !!! Yeah, fuck that. "
689,fy1olbz,"It's funny u mentioned premarital sex and alcohol cos I'm talking to a woman in PM right now and she gave the same retort. 

Like I said to her, NO ONE defends using alcohol or having sex before marriage, I have not heard one person say ""it doesn't hurt me"" ""don't judge"" they explicitly say its HARAM and you should try your best to refrain from it.

but when it comes to LGBTQ Muslim women especially like to TIPTOE around the situation and provide 100 excuses. I'm not telling u to hate ppl for their sins, im just questioning why Muslim women are sympathetic to g*ys and consider ME a homophobe for hating what Allah has forbidden"
690,fydm1vs,"And Muslim women are being beaten and raped and killed by regular people outside their home countries if they *do* wear a face covering. 

The problem is that the government in the home countries are corrupt. People need to stop hating on the religion which doesn’t force women to cover themselves, and instead start directing the hate towards the overly strict government."
691,fzglhh6,"I don't care about being called islamophobic because I aknowledge that islam is a bad thing. Do you think that slavery is a bad thing ? Do you think that forcing wives to have sex with their husband is bad ? Because if you do, those things are in the Quran. If the Quran had such immoral things, islam is immoral. 

And really I dislike the ""islamophobia"" argument thrown around for no reason. I state the obvious, islam is totally incompatible with the values I stand behind, thus islam is bad (Because those values are basic imo). You can disagree of course, but it's annoying that no one can acknowledge the reality of islam without being called islamophobe. And the irony is that I can't say that in the muslim world without being literally killed. I should have every right to criticise an idea, a religion. I know that muslims can face discrimination of course and I am totally against that. But islam, as a religion, is a bad thing. Muslim women are treated like lesser than men. They have to pray behind men, to be silent.  One man's word equals two women's word. There is a lot of pressure put in women to have children. Women should always obey their husband. Should I continue ? Isn't it middle ages thinking ? Because it is literally: The muslim world is still following the awful words and terrible deeds of a middle ages man. That's the truth.

Sorry for being salty but really it annoys me how we can't criticise islam without being categorized as an ugly word similar to ""racist"". I was born into a muslim family and leaving islam is punished by death in some muslim countries. I am not hating muslims (which is wrong) but I am hating on islam (and I have every right to it, it is an ideology, just like anyone can hate communism, christianity, nationalism...)"
692,g01a0hp,"Yes, many Muslim women are also advocating ISIS, this is how much you can do with proper brainwashing. Same for US chrinstians aka Westboro Baptist church of hate. Scary stuff I know for you."
693,g0s7gdp,I’m not American. Stop generalizing everyone who has a different opinion as you as an American male. That’s such a blatant straw man argument tactic. We want to live in a world with as little hate and suffering as possible. Muslim women are suffering from real patriarchal oppression caused by a inherently toxic belief system.
694,dh24gm2,"I don't get this sudden fascination by feminists with the Islamic people. I am truly starting to believe that they identify these rapists as the ultimate alpha chads and that is why they are supporting them so heavily.

No, not all Islamic men are rapists and killers. But enough of them are for me to take caution around them. Should we round up every Islamic individual? No. Should we lay down the law when they exhibit radical behavior? Absolutely."
695,fvs137b,"
""we don't have to hate them as long as they never have sex"".  You've got to marvel at the sexual gatekeeping. I wonder if they'd be so cavalier if they were the ones who'd have to give up sex for the rest of their lives.
These poor incels only get sex themselves when muslim women are forced/arranged to marry them. They wouldn't stand a chance if women could actually compare and choose, and they know it.
The fact that they have zero game is why the jannah with it's awaiting soulless and character-less houri orgy scenario is such a powerful incentive. But only straight sex. Even in heaven. According to islam, LGBTQ people are fucked (not literally lol) on both earth and in the afterlife. The only way they get in is celibacy. And their reward in heaven is celibacy for eternity. Maybe lesbians might get lucky, who knows..."
696,fw25x23,"Not all planes have alcohol on board, has nothing to do with traveling between Muslim countries. 

Also I hate this narrative that Muslim women are somehow more submissive and pure and all that toxic masculine bullshit. Muslim women are women. They will have sex if they want to. If Yazan wanted easy sex he would have found it - and I doubt he was not a virgin before meeting Brittany."
697,fwklhax,"As a muslim, I hate that story about a father killed (or was it beheaded?) his own son simply because god gave him a dream to kill his own son. 

I also hate this one story about a very sick muslim man that is filled with maggots. He cant work and nobody want to hire his wife in fear of them catching the maggots. Since the wife had long and pretty hair, she cut her hair and sold it to get some money to buy foods for her husband. His husband, instead, got angry seeing her hair and swore he would hit her a few hundreds times after he got recover from the maggots.

One of my favorite story however, is about a muslim woman. This woman is very beautiful, despite covering her whole body and even her face, her pretty eyes cant be hidden away. And so, one day this one muslim guy complimented her eyes. She then gauged her eyes out, gave them to him, and says 'If you think its beautiful, take them.' and she then died the very next day. It teaches me despite covering up muslim women are still, subjected to sexual objects.

I hate Islam."
698,fr4egkr,"As much as i hate muslims, muslim women are actually pretty beatiful, why else would their husbands force them to wear those hibabs to cover their body."

There's a thread about non believers in Morroco here  https://www.reddit.com/r/Morocco/comments/ggjx18/nonbelievers_of_morocco/  So at least there are some non religious people there.|Thanks for this, haven’t seen it and I’m on that sub quite a bit !|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gxq7rt/ex_muslim_girl_now_living_in_america_ama/ft4a5ei/)
As a closeted ex muslim myself, was it worth to destroy the relationship with your family, assuming it had a big impact on them|Yes! Life is short and you gotta live for yourself! Also my mom and I are now close so that wasn’t destroyed and my dad was abusive (physically and verbally as are many others Muslim dads)  ETA - in case you missed my other comment, I don’t speak to my dad, I told him if he wants to be part of my life I require some changes and he wouldn’t accept ✌🏻|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gxq7rt/ex_muslim_girl_now_living_in_america_ama/ft4742t/)
How was your first time trying bacon?|First time I didn’t like it! Lol tried again few years later and I love it, except I like them v v crispy and the first one i tried was not.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gxq7rt/ex_muslim_girl_now_living_in_america_ama/ft4c3gl/)
did your parents feel betrayed or where they like meh it's a whole different country who gives a $hit|Ha I don’t speak to my father, he became a lot stricter when we moved here actually. My mom was sad but has accepted it, I refused to live in hiding 🤷🏽‍♀️ they also separated and he blames her for how I turned out|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gxq7rt/ex_muslim_girl_now_living_in_america_ama/ft45ijc/)
What ethnicity are you?|🇲🇦|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gxq7rt/ex_muslim_girl_now_living_in_america_ama/ft47gy2/)
What about Muslim / ex Muslim friends of your age group.  How have they reacted to your decision / lifestyle change?|I had 0 Muslim friends, couldn’t relate, ever! They thought I was weird and i thought same of them lol. I only had one family friend who was close in age to me, i didn’t need to tell her as she started seeing on FB what i was doing and we haven’t spoken.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gxq7rt/ex_muslim_girl_now_living_in_america_ama/ft48fc8/)
I completely understand your situation have your family reached out or threatened you since you denounced your religion? Are you still close with your mom?|Yep! My dad thinks it’s a phase but we haven’t spoken in 5years and haven’t seen him in longer than that. My mom has accepted and we’re good, at first she didn’t want me to tell my one younger sibling but now my sibling on their own has stopped fasting etc.. and is researching and knows about me as well.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gxq7rt/ex_muslim_girl_now_living_in_america_ama/ft4dlr6/)
I attended college in Dearborn, Michigan, and saw many girls struggling with similar situations.  One in particular singled me out one day due to how I acted in class.  She had taken her hijab off because she didn't believe what her parents did... but felt like EVERYBODY was staring at her.  She was in tears not knowing what to do, but she retreated to a bathroom and put it back on.  It bothered me to no end that she couldn't be who she wanted to be.  I tried to catch her in conversation again after that, but I think she was embarrassed by it all and always kept her distance.   On a side note, I waited to make sure she was okay outside of class right after she approached me, and the teacher had just let everybody in.  He waved for me to go in as well but quickly explained the situation.  ""Say no more, come in when you two are ready.""   Man that guy was awesome.|I’m familiar with Dearborn! I went to college in Michigan as well :)  How did you act in class to be singled out? And I hate that more than anything because I’ve seen soooo many girls like her, I worked at a banquet hall in college and one time and this family rented it out to celebrate graduation, they told me no male servers were allowed in, as soon as door closed they were in the SKIMPIEST outfits! And were twerking and doing normal 17/18years old stuff while their moms sat and talked lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gxq7rt/ex_muslim_girl_now_living_in_america_ama/ft4dxox/)
What was the breaking point|I didn’t have a breaking point per say, I never fasted, when I was encouraged to pray I faked it etc. my whole thing was to live an honest life, I hated seeing all these Arab men drink, smoke, date and get away with it while girls had to be these perfect quiet angels.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gxq7rt/ex_muslim_girl_now_living_in_america_ama/ft4dytp/)
You say you still believe in God; why? Did you denounce Islam on any particular set of principles? Or was it more about fitting in and personal freedom?|Personal freedom was huge, however I was raised that if i did x I’d go to hell, everything’s answer was basically going to hell. While I noticed other religions were more forgiving and you were able to make mistakes and it wasn’t fear based, that opened my eyes. However, I don’t believe in Jesus, Virgin Mary, or prophets/disciples to convert.  Of course Islam also treats women as secondary and that’s not okay either.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gxq7rt/ex_muslim_girl_now_living_in_america_ama/ft4e3et/)
Do you live alone? How did you move out? How did you tell your parents?  I might be moving out soon myself and any tips would be helpful because I feel my family won't take it well.|I went away to college, I chose one 5 hours away basically by telling them that it was the best program for my major and i had to go etc etc.. i also hid a lot of the loans from them ( now I’m in major college debt but kinda worth it!) I will say that I think if my parents hadn’t divorced around same time that would’ve been harder for me. Once I moved out, I never returned home. I now am back in my city and live alone.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gxq7rt/ex_muslim_girl_now_living_in_america_ama/ft4emr6/)
I'm proud of you even though i never met you. You go girl!  As you said life is to short to not live it.  Have you met any person that was in a similar position like you?|Thank you so much!!  I have not, i’ve been debating a YouTube or podcast to discuss all these things because I KNOW there are multiple Muslims out there feeling same as me, and many are females that don’t have anyone to relate to so I wanted to see what this AMA will bring and if I should pursue that.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gxq7rt/ex_muslim_girl_now_living_in_america_ama/ft4f2lk/)
What aspect of your life now (after leaving Islam) are you most happy about?  Conversely, I would like to know what you miss most about Islam/being Muslim?|I miss nothing lol maybeeeeee the community feeling but that had to do more with leaving my home country than Islam (sorry!)  I am most happy that i live a genuine happy honest life, a lot of ex Muslims have to live in hiding and fear. Life is short.  Ps I say honest because when you leave Islam, everyone talks badly about you and how devil got you etc and how your life will suck...lol but I went to college, graduated, have  a great job (furloughed now due to covid) travel the world multiple times a year, live alone, drink great wine/alcohol and pay my bills.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gxq7rt/ex_muslim_girl_now_living_in_america_ama/ft4fe2e/)
Congrats on that!  Anyways, what is the hijab for? Always wondered.|Modesty. Muslim women are expected to cover up around men unless it’s father/brother/husband. It’s so that the men won’t be tempted. ( hair is a huge turn on as you know 😂)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gxq7rt/ex_muslim_girl_now_living_in_america_ama/ft4gwtz/)

700,fnfvksh,"&gt; I'm actually not anti-Muslim at all. I have spoken up rather strongly against the concentration camps China has created for over 1 million Muslims. I saw nothing in your post history about that.

Yet you went on with the ""muslim women are slaves"" trope etc etc, you may not be one but it raises a question and is generally a shitty move unless you are a right wing troll. 

&gt;Your hatred of all things western is blinding you to reality, or you are just evil dressed up as a Muslim. 

I never said i hate the west, im just criticizing your foreign policy and your leaders behaviour, what makes you think i have anything against the average joe? From the star what we have been discussing has been geopolitics.

&gt;Edit: and with a 4 day old account and a username designed to incite people, I'm guessing you are just out to be nasty anyway.

Why are redditors so obsessed with account age and usernames? I constantly nuke my accounts because i think its better for my privacy that way, and usernames are meaningless, i dont get why you are taking this personally, i have not attacked you."
701,fns3mcq,"Yeah I hate it when people are this arrogant/ignorant but I don't think this is the case here. We could start a long fruitless discussion about western values and which are the ones we agree with, but in the end we won't get to a clear conclusion because all of this is a very personal subject. *My personal* believe is that individual freedom of speech, believe and expression are among the most valuable things that a human can and should have, which clearly stands in conflict with any kind of religious law. Who am I to say whether muslim women are ok with this or not (I personally know both) let alone if this is ""right"". I do know however, that especially muslim women are often indirectly forced to their believe by family and community. And thats what I have a problem with, no matter what those women say after they have been brainwashed their entire childhood."
702,fnyqqf4,"Listen buddy continue your accutane, use a concealer for your acne scars and work on your weight, maybe you will find someone who likes you for you rather than using these stupid ideologies to spread hate because of your insecurities.

Stop **appropriating** these toxic MGTOW and redpill ideologies in Islam. They are incompatible regardless of what you want to believe. You are manipulating Hadiths and Quranic verses to push your judgemental narrative to **misguide** Muslim men.

Here’s an example of your advice to a person who wanted to marry a non-virgin Muslim/Christian women for sex and then dump her when he reaches 30 to remarry a younger Muslim women (the type of toxic people attracted to your sub 🤮):

&gt; So if you meet in any public place that's fine and you don't need a Wali because you will not be alone.

You are recommending him to meet a potential without a wali, this is not what Islam instructs us about Islamic marriage procedures. 

&gt;Another way you can meet girls is through Muslim marriage apps, but be prepared to find many post wall girls in their 30s who have been riding the CC in their 20s and now want to meet a ""nice guy"" to please daddy lol. There are so many girls with huge red flags who use these apps. I wouldn't recommend it and it's sad but many Muslim beta simp guys fall for it and marry a girl on there thinking they got a good deal when they really married a former slut lol. You **won't** find the practising girls using these apps for a reason.

........the way you appropriated the toxic mentality common in the MGTOW/redpill subs about non-Muslim women to describe our Muslim women.... it’s a shame, regardless of what you say the majority of our Muslim women are far far better than the mentality you are preaching."
703,fpd3jrz,"We all know Christianity had dark things in the past. But the difference between christians and Muslims these days, is that there are far more Muslims who haven't adapted to modern times and still function the same as they did 1,000 years ago. Which is why to this day, Muslim women are still oppressed, gays might still get stoned by Muslims, and Muslims still will kill people who don't follow their religion.

Islam has not adapted to the modern world what so ever.

Meanwhile this girl thinks she's being cool in front of the camera while simultaneously wearing a hijab, a straight up sign of women's oppression by Islam. Funny how Muslim women who grew up in the US think they're being cool by wearing the hijab. Meanwhile women in Iran, etc who live under true Islamic oppression hate the hijab. This woman in the picture is yet another sign of the pure if orange of US ""Muslims""."
704,fkradr5,"It doesn’t, I hate when retards that never been to the Middle East and don’t know it’s history talk shit. It’s like European conquest but using ideals. You all believe that your ideals are the best and not flawed. Islam was progressive for its time and it does these things to protect women. Women should be free to do and dress as they please, however, as we all know, some men are monsters and if incited will do horrible things to venerable women. The head scarfs were meant to empower women. I see the flaws of it but what it was to help them yet some Islamic teachings use to  control women, even though it’s optional. Muslim women are not weak or feeble, it’s a choice and respect it. If a girl says it isn’t or is in need of help, help her. But when she is proud respect her."
705,fhly847,"&gt;just saw this... is it a joke?

No. But thank you for yours.  I have nothing to apologize for, especially to jokers like you.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;you’re saying if a third or fourth grade child’s “marriage” experience didn’t affect her as with most reported cases

You're waffle, waffle, waffling!  lol.    Do you own a Waffle House franchise, or just supply them with waffles?!  lol.  You started with ""...reality confirms the proven damages. I wanted to know how you could justify harm regardless of that....""  Now you're at ""as with most reported cases"".

Jokers like you are so in love with leveling the charge of pedophilia, but I keep asking you all: Is it the pattern of behavior that a ""pedophile"" has a girl available to him at 6 years old, but waits until she becomes pubescent before having intercourse with her?  Is that the MO of a pedophile?  Tell us, since you seem to be a very knowledgeable guy (lol) in terms of reality: What does statistics tell you about that?  

In fact, you probably won't tell us how ridiculous your claim of pedophile is in face of the reality that the Prophet, peace be upon him, waited for the girl to become a woman, at puberty, but you'll just go on repeating your nonsense.  Perhaps if you repeat it often enough, someone else like you will believe it?  That's the plan, isn't it?  I don't care if you choose to fool yourself, but I hate the fact that someone might believe you.

Since you're gonna provide us with ""SCIENTIFIC"" research data, what does science tell us is the difference between a girl and a woman?  What's the key defining factor?  lol.  Please leave Waffle House before you answer.  LOL.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Your logic is weird according to you a victim manipulated into thinking its abuse is normal = not abuse anymore

This is not my logic.  This is the logic you're projecting on me.  If someone victimizes another, or manipulates another, or abuses another, these thing are wrong.  Do us a favor, though, prove to us, PRETTY PLEASE, that there was a ""victim"", that someone was ""manipulated"", and that there was ""abuse"" in the case of the marriage of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and 'Aisha, radi Allaahu 'anhaa.  Remember, while answering, you must bring EVIDENCE of your claims - though this is not a court of law - otherwise, in addition to WAFFLING, you're SLANDERING those who were much better than you!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;nuns choose living that way, christian women aren’t forced to do it ‘or else they’d be sinners’.

That a nice little twist: 'or else they'd be sinners'.  You couldn't stop at ""forced"", because you'd have to admit that Muslim women are not ""forced"" to wear the hijaab.  So, slick, you add your little spin. lol. Nice!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;lmao what kind of comparison is this

It's the kind of comparison that decent people understand.  But, magicians and spin doctors don't.  Sorry for you.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;lmao

Soooo, that's why you don't have any brains!  Thanks for letting us know why you're waffling, and accusing others of what they didn't say or do."
706,fi3779c,Not really when there are literally hate crimes in England every week where Muslim women are attacked/verbally abused just for being a Muslim.
707,fio3y7o,"Okay this is a huge and possibly offensive rant. I'm starting to dislike being a Muslim woman because of how poorly we are treated. I came to the realization that what they say about us Muslim women being oppressed is actually true in many cases. Certainly in mine. Everytime this is brought up, people love to derail and change the subject by saying how Islam has honored women and given them rights. That doesn't mean sh*t if it's not put into practice because oppression of women is a huge problem in our cultures and nobody wants to change it. 

This all came about because I've been thinking of visiting Egypt and I was warned not to go because of the rampant sexual harassment against women. I did some research and not only is it true, but it's even worse than what I've been told. I saw a video from New Year's 2020 where a huge mob of Egyptian men were surrounding a young woman and harassing her while she screamed for help and attempted to escape. Apparently getting sexually assaulted by a gang of men is a regular occurrence in Egypt, there's a whole Wikipedia page on it. These animals will assault any woman with a pulse, even if she's in full niqab. This is supposedly Muslim men. Not only is their punishment very minimal, but often times the victim is blamed and intimidated. Needless to say I am disgusted and disturbed and will not be going to Egypt.

Sexual harassment is just one symptom of the oppression of Muslim women all over the world. Out of the 10 absolutely worst countries for women, 6 are Muslim countries according to a Reuters study. Lack of access to economic resources, healthcare, being subjected to physical and sexual abuse, and overall having few rights. Muslim women are second class citizens who are seen as sexual objects, property, livestock and breeding machines. I don't understand why my life has to be so much worse just because I had the great misfortune of being born with female parts. 

And the cherry on top of this mess is that Islam is used to justify these things. In many Muslim countries abusing or hurting a woman isn't even punished. Men justify themselves with Quran ayat and hadith and it's all good. So many of our religious leaders are corrupt and condone this. It doesn't matter if it's NoT aLl MeN because the ""good"" men do nothing to stop the bad ones. Don't even get me started on the Muslim women who are complicit in their own oppression and actively work to oppress other women or silence those who speak up. It makes me sick. We as the Ummah have completely and utterly failed. 

I'm terrified of ever bringing a daughter into this sh*tty world and watching her go through the same faith crisis as me. People always say ""it's not Islam it's culture"" whenever I discuss this but if that's the case then why hasn't there been any kind of effort to throw away these toxic cultures? It's 2020 and Muslimahs are still being sold as child brides, being raped and assaulted, forced to undergo FGM, shamed, controlled, abused, humiliated, etc. Non Muslims hate us for what we believe and our own people treat us like subhumans. Literally what are supposed to do 

/Rant over"
708,fipb14e,"I'm not sure what the Islamic ruling behind this would be and I feel like it's too complicated for Reddit to answer, you might need to ask a scholar. I guess if it's permissible in Islam for them to actually do the Nikkah for you then, yes, some women would be okay with it (especially if like you said, they're open to adopting), just like some non Muslim women are open to the same situation. But if it's not permissible to sign the marriage contract then it gets a lot more complicated. And then there's the question of whether a nikkah contract would even be needed because you were both born as women? I don't mean this insensitively but I'm not sure if you'd be counted as a man or woman. I'd be very interested in knowing the answer but again I think you'd need an actual scholar's opinion on this.

Assuming that it is permissible, I personally still wouldn't because I want kids of my own. 

I hope people don't give you trouble or hate for this, like you said it was before you converted so you're completely forgiven for it."
709,fjecq1r,"I know people hate this word, but it just comes down to toxic masculinity.

The whole thing stems from dumb Eve being the one who tempted Adam bc men didn't want to be responsible for their behavior.

If you look throughout history, wives were for dynastic purposes, hence they had to be protected to ensure only your genetic material was passed down due to above reasons as well as the lack of ways to test of parentage. Also the idea was that if your wife was from a similar religion/area/community, then she could be trusted enough to teach your kids to rebel against the established authority.

Also xenophobia and racism plays a role in people's attitudes towards marrying someone from a different. Because how can an outsider understand your culture, religion, language etc.?

The idea that non-Muslim women are ""other"" and therefore beneath Muslim women is what makes Muslim men behave this way.

Victim blaming also plays a huge part.

I've seen families call non-Muslim women witches because they ""stole"" their precious sons away by black magic etc. 

Growing up with such fucked up teachings, Muslim men think it's perfectly fine to mistreat non-Muslim women even worse than they treat Muslim women. 

Plus Muslim women have no one else other than a Muslim man to marry, so of course, they put up with that shit, act holier than thou and don't ever bother smacking their fuckwad husbands and sons not to behave this way. 

It's all fucking shit and every time I hear non-Muslim girls falling in love with a Muslim man my reaction is to say ""GIRL YOU IN DANGER! RUN DON'T WALK!"""
710,fjgai6c,"It’s easy to understand. Feminists are, as you say, “defective humans”. 

*Everything* that happens is some issue with them, even though there are zero rights in the west they don’t have and you’ll never once hear them speak out on how Muslim women are treated — they secretly love that shit because they hate women most of all.

One of the best things about recent culture shifts is the thorough rejection of the woke feminist ideology. Woman are finally realizing what it is and abandoning that trash by the millions, because they see how perpetually miserable these people are and want no part of it."
711,fe6rz94,"&gt;Interesting Make Bhakts want to take inspiration from Saudi in matters of Gender Dynamics in society. They are really amazed by modesty of Arab women. Lol

THIS. I have retarded cousins who hate muslims but love the idea of how muslim women are suppressed. ""This is how women should dress and behave."" Bunch of incels."
712,fgekt77,"Lol. I got time.

Bigotry -- ""​the state of feeling, or the act of expressing, strong, unreasonable beliefs or opinions"" (Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary).

Let me break it down to you how what they said was clearly an unreasonable set of beliefs:

1) ""Muslim women are not allowed to attend med schools even in their muslim countries"" -- absolutely false. ""The fields of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and nursing have attracted a large number of Arab women. They constitute a considerable percentage of the enrollment in Egypt, Algeria, Kuwait, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Tunisia. Medicine is a prestigious and lucrative profession, and is considered a very acceptable and fitting occupation for women, as most Arab women prefer to be treated by women doctors particularly in gynecology and obstetrics."" ([Source, Cornell University](https://middleeast.library.cornell.edu/content/education-women-arab-world)).

2) ""Even Quran probably prohibits it."" The Qur'an does not prohibit women from seeking any form of education. Since you seem like you want sources, [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00344087.2014.868203?journalCode=urea20). To be clear, Islam encourages women to pursue education. Let me know if you can't access it. I linked an academic paper since you seem like you won't enjoy traditional tafseer sources.

3) ""You clearly aware that you need western civilization to achieve your goals"" -- see above, this is clearly an unreasonable belief. Which is one definition of bigotry.

4) ""[...] because in a truly islam country you wouldn't even be allowed to attend high school"" -- again, see above.

5) ""Are you talking about female muslim ""doctor"" who refused to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a male patient? or another female muslim ""doctor"" who refused to treat a patient who had alcohol poisoning? These are real examples."" A more interesting argument. I am not aware of these two stories, but let's just assume that they are real. It is still a hasty generalization and a major fallacy to imply that this is the standard of care by Muslim women. These one-off stories simply serve as confirmation bias for the bigoted, and clearly do not represent the reality of Muslim physicians. If you disagree, please provide me with sources denoting that these types of events are the standard of care by Muslim women physicians.

6) ""Female muslim ""doctors"" are not willing to interact with male patients in general. Wearing hijab reduces one's flexibility as well."" I honestly find it difficult to take this statement seriously. I hate the fact that this user used quotation marks in such a disrespectful manner. But nonetheless -- I figured for this part of my reply I need to resort to scholarly sources. In sum, it is absolutely okay for female Muslim physicians to do their jobs when it is otherwise unreasonable to expect another physician to take over ([Source, Seekers Guidance](https://seekersguidance.org/answers/hanafi-fiqh/how-can-i-follow-my-religion-working-as-a-female-doctor/)). Of course, the person asking the question seems to be concerned, but ultimately, as a Muslim, we rely on scholarly opinions before we act. And ultimately, it's clear that Muslim female physicians can treat male patients. And I won't even talk about the ""hijab limits flexibility"" portion, I find it unproductive when the user has not even defined what they mean by ""flexibility.""

Lastly, let's talk about me ""illogically defending my in-group."" I do not believe any part of what I mentioned above is illogical. More importantly, me calling someone out for being hateful has nothing to do with my in-group (other than the fact that I am simply more likely to react, but I do try to call out any hatred that I see and of which I have sufficient knowledge to challenge).

I hope you have a good night."

You sound very angry and I get it, I also hate liberals who go all ""Islamophobe"" when Islam is subject to criticism just like any other religion, especially women who defend the hijab when Muslim women are actually forced to wear them, but those do not represent all of the left-wing, that's what I'm saying. Atheists are usually centrists or left-wingers (and they are also right wingers of course) , and just like they criticize other religions they criticize Islam, this sub is enough proof.
The outrage culture that you see on Twitter is never the whole image, if you go on the LGBT side of social media and see Muslims harassing them in the name of religious freedom they get bashed by none other than hardcore liberals.

All in all, you're right, liberals who blindly defend Islam are annoying and need a reality check but that's because they listen to Muslims in the West and not the one in the Middle East. 

I cannot explain my point any further, you have this image of all liberals being social justice warriors hired to instantly defend Islam, that's not true, so stop generalizing ""lefties this"" and ""lefties that""."
716,fcgn2w8,"&gt;Which means that a male leader is more likely to be concerned about the females he is in charge of than the reverse situation. Gynocentrism partially justifies patriarchy because on average men will treat women more fairly then women will treat men.

That too is the conclusion I've come to. Societies with a predominance of men in power still do largely look out for the interests of women. By and large, men are still team players with deep concern for their mothers, sisters and daughters and willing to act and vote in their interests even at the expense of other men.

I mean, in the past, that horrible patriarchal time where men supposedly had ALL the power? Married women were granted extensive protections and entitlements, such as the right to financial support from their husbands, the right to purchase goods on their husbands' credit, the ability to evade punishment for the crimes they committed, etc. And while husbands were head of household and were entitled to have control over any assets of his marriage, including those his wife brought into the marriage (a right given to him because he had the sole responsibility of keeping the entire family afloat and to increase their holdings), there were safeguards in place in the law to prevent physical and financial abuse by husbands against wives. Those safeguards were put in place BY MEN when they had dominion over politics, the ""legitimate"" economy and the law.

And when women started complaining that the lot that they were given didn't suit them? ""The Patriarchy"" was super happy to give women everything they asked for, no matter how unequal it made things. For example, when feminists pushed for reform of marital property laws and managed to convince male lawmakers to give married women the right to hold their property and their income as their own within marriage, it remained their husbands who were held 100% financially liable for providing all necessaries to the family, including the wife, even though he had no right to touch anything she earned. The laws surrounding marriage were turned into a codified version of ""What's mine is mine, and what's yours is mine too, honey"". Rights without responsibilities. Entitlements without obligations. The male-dominated power structure gave women *all of it.*

And as far as I know, this is still the case today in allegedly evil, horrible, no good, oppressive places like the Middle East. Muslim women are entitled to support from their husbands. Just like what happened in the West only after feminism had its way with marital property law, women can not only work under Islamic law, but they need not share their earned income with their families. Basically, if a Muslim woman has a job, the money she earns is hers and hers alone, while her husband remains obligated to provide any and all economic support for the family, including the necessities his working wife requires for her own upkeep. How fucking oppressive for women THAT is.

It seems to me right now that the evil patriarchy of feminist imagination is their own projection. That if they were in charge of things, they'd legitimately oppress and subjugate the opposite sex to the benefit of their own, and so they simply assumed that this must be what men have been doing this whole time.

As girlwriteswhat says: ""What do we see with, say, feminist jurisprudence? We see calls for women's prisons to be abolished. We see calls for men's due process protections to be eroded or eliminated. We see demands that burden of proof be lowered and penalties increased solely regarding alleged crimes by men against women. We see objections to alimony, but only when women are stuck paying it. We see demands for ever more convenient and cheap ways for women to refuse to consent to the obligations of parenthood, and simultaneous demands for men to be held financially responsible for the outcome of every ejaculation, and for increasingly harsh penalties for the men who can't or won't pay. We see objections to shared custody legislation. And we see national debates, on publicly funded broadcasters, posing the position statement, [""be it resolved, men are obsolete.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOvCR-sA9VY&amp;list=PLjdgXaecKQuEMiXn9toHGetN5HWuEPmVp)""

""I really hate to come across as a male supremacist, but when I look at what feminist jurisprudence is all about, and when I look at how few women are standing against it, I'm forced to consider the possibility that if women were in charge, that false, exaggerated ""women were chattel"" narrative that doesn't actually reflect actual history would be imposed on men. That the fictional history of women that feminists promulgate is what women would tolerate for men.""

&gt;But in many, though not all, circumstances you could put that the other way around and say societies put more responsibility on males rather than more value on females.

I don't think these two things are mutually exclusive at all, in fact I would say societies generally tend to do both. Societies tend to place the responsibility on men to provide for and protect women (as well as their children). And I doubt this would be the case if we did not value women. From time immemorial, women always have been designated as a protected class, and it was up to their husbands and male relatives to provide them with that protection even at risk to their own wellbeing, health, and even life."
717,f8elfvz,"If you went up to anyone who lives their life with strong religious beliefs and some guy comes at them with ""strict and intolerant"" they'd be pretty upset too.

It's sad but Muslim women are denied many rights so that is their reality so it's easy for is to believe they all hate it, but for all we know some maybe even this women just accept it and live their day to day lives normally. Now this jackass who probably lives in place without sand constantly trying to find it's way into the crack of his ass is saying ""why wear this? Just be free. Your way of life is dumb.""

You know you linked one of the most discredited sites on the entire internet right?  

&gt; All of those things are illegal! There’s no reason to introduce legislation against stoning to death?? It’s completely redundant and only meant to piss off Muslims. If we didn’t pass anti Sharia law that means we’d be stoning people? Why is it so hard for you to put this together?


&gt; Sharia, or Muslim religious law, has been highly controversial in the UK. Interpretations of Sharia are associated in other countries with harsh penalties unknown in the UK; campaigners and politicians worry that Muslim women are discriminated against when family disputes are resolved under Sharia.

https://fullfact.org/law/uks-sharia-courts/

Yes or no. Do you support stoning women for adultery or not?  If no, you don’t support sharia law. 

Stoning women to death is only one of the most egregious examples of Sharia law. Women are discriminated in a myriad of ways under it. And in the UK “Sharia courts” have been set up. And as quoted above, they can be used to discriminate against Muslim women. 

Female genital mutilation is illegal in the UK, but

&gt; Female genital mutilation in the United Kingdom is the ritual removal of some or all of the external female genitalia of women and girls living in the UK. According to Equality Now and City University London, an estimated 103,000 women and girls aged 15–49 were thought to be living with female genital mutilation (FGM) in England and Wales as of 2011.[n 1][2]


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation_in_the_United_Kingdom

Now there are over 100,000 cases. It being illegal doesn’t mean it can’t happen, or doesn’t. Especially in close knit religious communities.

I thought AP was agnostic but being an atheist is even worse. Why support someone who thinks Christianity is nonsense? Lmao. The length some christian go to bash Islam. 

David wood is wrong because he claims God prays to a man, which is a laughable and absurd statement brought forth to any theist, with the exception of maybe a trinitarian. It's not the muslims who claimed this, but wood himself, funny how you're trying to twist it around to say it was Muslims who said it, just like how CP himself said muslim women are whores and you try and twist it. Brainwashing at its finest. David wood regularly cross-dresses and spent 10 years in jail because he almost killed his own father. You have low standards for role models. 

CP is just an another nobody who wants to make easy cash by falsely bashing Islam, hes been going around begging Muslim scholars to debate him on Skype but no one will give him the time of day unless he does it in person, but he won't cuz he'll be exposed. Why don't you support christian scholars who actually have knowledge on Christianity and Islam? Scholars willingly to go live and put their reputation on the line and not echo chamber basement dwellers who failed in life (AP,CP) who bash religion for easy cash.

Allah wants everyone to dress modestly, and that can be with or without headwear.

The underlying problem with women is that they will change your society.  Whether that's *perverting* the intentions of the Founding Fathers, or dismantling the (actual) patriarchy of a desert death cult.  The problem with women is deciding whether you like your culture, or you want to destroy it.  Want to destroy your culture?  Give women enfranchisement.  It's sad, but true.  No matter how great (or terrible) your society is, women will take it upon themselves to tear it all down.

It's because they're fickle.  That's it.  I'll just come out and say it.  They're fickle.  It's a case of ""What have you done for me lately?""

Islam inherits every single one of its negative views of women from Judaism and Christianity. In fact, most 'horrible Islamic teachings' are just softer versions of horrible Jewish teachings.

It's interesting how virtue-signalling conservatives never point that out, and yes, it's all virtue signalling because visibly Muslim women are the primary targets of anti-Muslim hate. The 'anti-Islam' crowd actively targets Muslim women, while their leaders like Trump empower theocrats in Saudi Arabia and rapists in Egypt. 

I have to admit, it's hilarious to see conservatives screeching about Muslims *believing the exact things they do.* There was a particularly funny case a few years back where professional con-artist Tommy Robinson tried to criticize a Muslim athlete for saying he wanted a traditional wife who stayed at home....when ""Tommy"" had said the exact same thing months earlier!

726,f27f9u3,"Do you agree then that one group is impacted substantially more? So far, there has been 6 known cases of individuals prohibited from working as teachers and they were all women of colors

The law disproportionately impacts Muslim women. Given Muslim women are already a marginalized group in Quebec and given the context of rising Islamophobia across the world and Quebec, including doubling of hate crimes in Quebec and a shooting at a mosque that left many Muslims dead; yeah, it is the responsibility of the legislator to ensure they do not pass laws that systematically prevents them from accessing jobs. The government has not given any proof that wearing of a religious symbol will limit one ability to objectively carry out a job. Its defense is typically that most Quebecois support the bill – but most Quebecois also have a negative view of Islam. Sure, you can say but this is because Quebecois society is secular, but what the polls show is that it is specifically Islam that seems to bother Quebecers and specifically the hijab."
727,f27htu9,"&gt;Do you agree then that one group is impacted substantially more?

Yes, clearly some groups are effected more than others, but in the same way that, say, a height restriction on an amusement ride will effect more black and white folks than asians because of differences in average height.  It's not about setting out to get black people/muslims, they just happen to be taller/more overt in their religious expressions.  If the height restriction existed to limit riders to Asians that's clearly a problem.  But maybe the ride is simply unsafe with passengers over a certain height, just as perhaps expression of political/religious beliefs at work in the public sector is simply inappropriate.

This is all covered by what I just said, but to be clear, being disproportionately effected is not the same thing as being targetted, like with my saffron analogy.

&gt;The government has not given any proof that wearing of a religious symbol will limit one ability to objectively carry out a job. Its defense is typically that most Quebecois support the bill – but most Quebecois also have a negative view of Islam.

This is actually compelling, but governments rarely justify their decisions with anything more than ""it's popular"", it's hardly specific to this case.  I agree that they should conduct a study though.  I'd be interested to see the comparative outcomes of a public facing government agency whose staff wore symbols (crosses, MAGA hats, yarmulkes, and Che shirts for example) opposed to one with no visible symbols.  I wonder if it would impact the quality of work in any measurable way.

Lastly, I'm disappointed that you didn't answer or comment on my main question:

how would you write a bill that places reasonable limits on free expression at work in the public sector?

Assuming that wearing religious/political symbols to work would effect the outcomes, any such law would disproportionately effect certain, more overt, beliefs (fascism, communism, islam, judaism, etc.) more than others by nature of those beliefs."

A woman who wants to wear a hijab, despite her living in a non fundamentalist country and her family telling her its her choice? Clearly it's internalized misogyny.

Not all Muslim women are lucky enough to have the choice, but you can't assume all hijabis are wearing it by force or social pressure. It takes away all possible autonomy that a woman might actually have.

733,ey52zaw,"HicJacetMelilla gave great points but you better believe there were others

So the show was originally 4 women making it in the city. It tackles relationships, careers, sex, etc. The women all got what they wanted in the end, albeit the unconventional way like Charlotte being the housewife she always wanted to be but with a Jewish man and an adopted child. 

There were problems that we know now but for the time it was pretty great to have a show show abortion or a woman not in need of a relationship to be happy.

The 2nd movie just destroys any good will it had. I can't remember everything it did so I'll give a rundown on what I remember as of now.

A kind of a big thing in the show was that there were two gay characters who were introduced to each other by their straight friends to get together. And they hate each other. ""He's awful why on earth would you think I would date him?"". It was refreshing for the LGBT+ community to have even an ep where its like ""oh they're gay and that's all they need to have in common to date"". In the second movie these two get married. Why? I don't fucking know. And its not just a simple nice wedding. Oh no. It was so outlandishly gay that my asshole bled rainbows. There were swans at the wedding (WTF they are vicious whose dumb idea was that), a choir of heavenly twinks serenaded them down the isle, the Liza fucking Minnelli  officiated the wedding and then did a rendition of Single Ladies with back up dancers. I couldn't believe.

The Ugly American thing is very real in this movie. Some poor woman is trying to enjoy the sun in a hijab with an iced tea while these bitches are trying to give some kind of shitty commentary on how her fashion is dictated by religion. Later on it is revealed that underneath the drab burkas, Muslim women wear high end Gucci. Like does this movie know that Muslim women are allowed to wear nice fabrics? Clearly not.

This movie thinks its an awesome mouthpiece for women but its such a farce. The sex positive Samantha is chugging different kinds of anti aging pills in the movie cause isn't it gross that women age? Charlotte is struggling cause she's worried that her young nanny who doesn't wear a bra is going to seduce her husband away while she bemoans that its so hard being a mother. Keep in mind whenever these children inconvenience her, she summons the nanny to take them away from her while she cries in her walk in wardrobe because they got jam on her white skirt. Her and Miranda toast to all mothers out there and its like ""you know, this may come as a shock but not everyone can afford a nanny and have to watch their kids all day, every day? How do poor people survive?""

That's the last thing I can remember off the top of my head. The sheer flexing of wealth in this movie is insulting. Carrie is bemused that she doesn't have to spend thousands of dollars on a pair of shoes in Abu Dhabi. She and Mr Big have a sentimental night watching a black and white film so for her birthday or Christmas (I can't remember which) he installs a telly in their bedroom where they can watch black and white movies in bed on romantic lie-ins. She says this present sucks and she wanted jewellery. Their breakfast buffets are just a spread of food that will never be finished. They literally dress like the villains in a Hunger Games movie. They have to leave to get to the airport now because if they don't they'll have to fly economy, could you even imagine.

I can't remember anymore but if you want the whole experience summed up I'd say look up the gay wedding scene. The movie is bad, the characters are shit. It could have said something but it didn't and if anything it took stuff away.

And now after writing all that on the bus home, I get to treat myself to a glass of wine and a bubble bath cause Lord knows that's all the extravagance I can afford!"

The problem is that muslim women are brainwashed by everyone including their moms, who've been brainwashed themselves, to believe that their religion is a good set of beliefs/institution that is truly harmless to them. Who wants to believe that their mom and everyone else is lying to them? And being coercive and complicit in their abuse?
When a casual religious person is outwardly supporting a major religious institution, they're directly supporting the very people who are out to harm society and anyone who isn't like them.
It's no surprise that the leading figures who are against LGBT people, specially in countries, are almost all without a fault, religious. Or, at the very least, they claim religion as the core reason for their hate against us.

But, cool. I get why many people are religious. They just don't want to rebel. They don't want to believe their parents would lie to them. Or their teachers, or their friends. They want to think that the people at church are completely harmless.
In a way, it makes sense to reject the notion that a big part of the world is directly complicit in a system that harms you. 
But, when you support things that do not need any explanation, you support the notion that one could justify their hatred for a person or groups of people simply based on their feelings, and be supported for it."
740,eqnn1pn,"I was thinking about this issue a lot a few days ago -- the situation in Saudi Arabia. I hate that feminists wanna bitch about such a great country like America but totally ignore the fact that Muslim women are basically slaves to their husbands. Even when they come over to America, they still treat their wives like shit. You can only imagine if you lived there and someone SUSPECTED you of being gay. Whenever I see some asshole mistreating his wife in a store, I try to go talk to her and make her smile, regardless of what her prick of a husband thinks. My grandmother does the same thing. But no, we can't talk about human's rights violation in the east because ""Brown man good, white man bad."" Jesus. It's hard to believe people are this afraid to admit Islam as it currently is in the Middle East is abusive and tyrannical."

742,ems6cqo,"There's a lot here that I disagree with, but lets focus on the key question first, which I do agree with. Women in Muslim majority countries are absolutely discriminated against, far more so than women in Western countries. I'm only speculating, but I would say this might be about the relationship between religion and culture. Despite what apologists for Islam have to say, theologically-speaking, the religion does discriminate against women and promotes misogyny. This in turn has influenced the culture in which most Muslims live. And while there's a growing sense of egalitarianism and a desire for gender equity in many parts of the Muslim world, this is despite Islamic theology, not because of it. Similarly, Muslims born and raised in the west aren't pro-women's rights because of Islam, but because of the influence of a culture that values women as intelligent agents. These influences cause us to want to find something within our theology that will support gender equity, but it is an uphill task in supporting Islamic gender equity when so much of the theology is clearly against it.

That said, let me highlight a few issues with your post that concern me. Muslim women in western countries are only somewhat better off, with an expanded role outside the home and their contributions to the workplace more highly valued. Moreover, police in western countries are more likely to take the perspective of the woman, whereas police in many Muslim countries will defer to the husband. 

But Muslim women in western countries also have to face another lay of discrimination. While still facing some gender discrimination, albeit less that they would face in a Muslim country, they are also discriminated against for being Muslims. This can come in two forms: being discriminated against for being visually Muslim (e.g. being spat upon for wearing a hijab), or being beaten by a husband who doesn't want his wife to wear a hijab. While the former is certainly more common, I've also seen a number of cases of the latter. In some western countries, women don't have the freedom to choose what they will wear; if you want to wear a hijab, you risk being arrested in some countries. In other countries, while you might not necessarily be violation of the law for wearing a hijab, you might still face unofficial discrimination in the workplace or in the public sphere (e.g. being refused service in a shop, asked to leave a public space, etc.), and that's something that Muslim men seldom have to deal with because we don't have the same visual identifiers of being a Muslim. Muslim women also face significant more violence in terms of anti-Muslim hate crimes than Muslim men, largely because western men are still beholden to the belief that women wont fight back when attacked, so Muslim women are safe targets."
743,emywvmv,"&gt; I don't understand why you are so concerned with the nationalist trolls. I get called ""pakka musalman"" (I am Hindu) on FB for saying bjp is bigoted against Muslims.

I will be honest. It's hard not to hate Hindus/Indians openly when I've read the most horrific stuff from them (especially when it comes to the rape of Muslim women and children by these bhakts where I've read everything possibly imagined and yet they still find new ways of surprising me; for example showing me how Muslim women are now infertile and how proud they are because after they ""had a good raping"" they can't ""breed"" anymore ""and had their uterus's removed""). It bothers me. It *really* bothers me. Because they show its real by citing sources and everything and are super proud of this type of stuff happening (especially to Kashmiri women). 

For a long while their actions and the way they talk about Muslims and how much they want to kill Muslims (and even ex-Muslims like me) literally made me think all Indians are *fucking evil*. To be honest if I had a semi-automatic shotgun and I saw an Indian on the border I probably wouldn't have thought twice about shooting him dead regardless of whether he was a good person or not.

This was not until I got into a relationship with a Sikh girl (I live in the UAE) that all this visceral hatred I had for Indians slowed down and stopped. Since then I've softened my tone on Indians (and I'm apologetic that I ever even hated Hindus collectively to begin with). I don't hate Hindus. Because I recognise there's good people out there and I was just digging myself into a massive hole just by repeatedly looking at these stories, engaging with the bhakts about atrocities against Muslims that India does nothing about. 

I'm still bothered by the fact that Modi, *fucking Modi* of all people, got elected (and probably will be elected again given what he's done in the past). I hate being so hateful sometimes. But sometimes I can't help it. The Modi bhakts are just all too real for me. I've softened my tone a lot now. The more time I spend with girlfriend the less I feel consumed by this hatred. I just criticise India mostly now (with fair game). I haven't used the word ""pajeet"" in a long while or anything or been ""racist"" much.

&gt;(remember that Pakistani mod who was pretending to be Indian Sikh?)

Turns out BillBatori was actually an Indian who pretended to be Pakistani who pretended to be a Sikh (he went on r/India and showed us he voted and had a passport and everything, he got kicked out of r/Pakistan).

&gt;Ban me fo saying this but users on chutyapa are no different then Hindutava trolls.

No ones gonna ban you. Yeah chutyapa's pretty cancerous sometimes but I feel it was pretty much because of all the stuff that was happening (Asifa Bano's rape case, the Kashmir crises last few months and Modi and Indian politicians literally bitching about us 24/7). Anyways, I sort of apologise. The bhakts really made me hate Hindus/Indians but honestly I'm done with that shit. I'd rather be happy and spend time with my fiance and pour all my love into her. I feel its really helped me calm down a lot."
744,ej4dxlt,Hate to break it to  you but there is nowhere in that comment where I said all muslim women are indoctrinated. There is literally nothing definitive about that comment. 
745,ejnxfqv,"When I was Christian, no one cared how I dressed, but as soon as I put on a scarf as a Muslim, I noticed the hate stares I would get in Canada, which I found quite shocking, because I was the same Canadian born and raised as I was the day before!

Then, various people in the press liked to suggest that my husband decides how I dress. While my husband did want someone who observed purdah, I was already dressing like that before the proposal. 

The subtext was really even more insulting with the insinuation that womem are brainless and they cannot even choose their own clothes! Muslim women are very brave. They are well aware of how they are portrayed in the media and I need my bravery and my resolution whenever I got out in public because I see people who hate what I stand for (Islam) or they pity me because they don't know that I grew up in a Christian household where my father drank himself into oblivion every night, and like my Scottish grandparents who lived tea-total through prohibition, I choose to live in a world where there is no alcohol and prayer is a priority every day of the week. My grandparents prayed all through WW II and three out of three children came home safe and sound! My father said people were afraid to ask after others for fear of hearing bad news, so their ""luck"" was not just luck. I see myself very much like my grandparents. The only difference is that they were Christian and I am Muslim. 

Christianity, as I experienced it, made less sense than Islam. There was the father, the son and the holy ghost. But my granny never worshipped Jesus or Mary. She signed every letter: God Bless, so she had the right of it!

In the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community I finally got my explanation of my own religion: the father is God, Jesus (who was a prophet of God and a messenger chosen by God) and the holy ghost is the archangel Gabriel who recited the Holy Quran to the prophet Muhammad over a period of 32 years.

So if you see a white woman in a scarf, it may be me. I feel Islam is the next evolutionary step in religion but that is just my choice. Everyone should be free to choose as much as I enjoyed the right to choose to teach high school English wearing the hijab.

746,ejzpddj,"Congrats! 

And I totally understand the parents in your head thing. When I first decided the way I was raised as a far right evangelical wasn't how I wanted to be. I struggled. I was fearful. I felt guilty. I knew I was doing the right thing but when you're raised with  ""you don't have morals if you don't hate everyone who is gay, atheist, and Muslim"" ""women are inferior to men"" ""we are superior because we are Christians"" etc and it's everyone you know and love... It is hard to find your voice and stand up to them. In time, it got easier. I learned to find my own voice and eventually it drowned out all the negative. My mom is in denial. But that's okay. We gotta do what's best for our health, mentally and physically. "
747,ek8wu8d,"&gt; How DARE you criticize Islam you hateful bigot

Very few people criticize Islam, they mostly just hate Muslims. It's especially obvious because Muslim women are generally the primary victims of anti-Muslim hate. "

749,ekvlege,"Yeah, that's true, but we don't all get the same ""unequal"" treatment, and white women aren't treated amazingly well here either by respective minorities' men. These differences might lead to friction. I'll use my own country as an example. In Belgium, anti-moroccan/amazigh sentiment isn't a white-only occaison, since most chinese and black people here are more than happy to take part in it, and vice versa. In terms of social anti-racism activist, the majority of anti-racism activism is focused only on black people, or on protecting muslim moroccans. This causes strife- ex-muslims are almost always told to just ""shut up"" and no-platformed, while hijab-wearing homophobic muslim women are applauded for saying crap like ""I wear this hijab because it is a choice!"". 

Institutionalized racism also works very differently here- most people in our jails are moroccan men, but that isn't due to ""racist bias"" in the courts; unlike the american issue with black people. It's due to these men's aggression problems &amp; their religious pride, and the fact that integration has largely failed in certain parts of the country. Over here, there's also a difference in the treatment of black people who have been here for generations, and those that have come over recently, and are incredibly religious. You can't group those, since they don't all have the same cultural background- neither do they even all get along. I know black people who'd be considered ""racist"" by american standards, for expressing sentiments that are completely normal here. 

If we look at it from a feminist perspective, I also don't feel like white women are that much ""above"" me in the foodchain here. If they're wealthy, sure. But brown men treat white girls even worse than brown girls over here- I constantly hear them speak about how they're just stupid sluts, and how white women ""ask for it"", and all that. I also know more than one white girl who's been assaulted by a brown man and was told she was ""racist"" when her parents went to the cops. Gay white guys get beat up by moroccans, and are too afraid to go to cops because they don't want to make it seem like all muslims hate gay people, and all that. I know certain neighborhoods in the capital of my country where you shouldn't go as a white person, because they'll fuck you up, or rob you. It's complicated. Yes, we're treated worse than those who are considered the ethnic dominant group, but that doesn't mean all of our issues allign with each other, or that we always treat each other with the respect we deserve. 

I'm also just not a fan of ""woc"" groups because I have always had the same experiences: anti-black racism is fought against, but other forms of racism (towards other races) are largely ignored; criticizing religion is deemed ""racist"", and race issues are held about women's rights issues constantly. I had the same issue on Tumblr, and Twitter. If race issues come to play, people suddenly don't give a shit about sexism anymore. D:

I'm totally in favor of a secondary group, though. If someone wants to start one, that's cool. I just feel like I wouldn't be able to be part of it, unless the moderation team was vetted, and not all one specific race, or all-american, for example. I'd also want it to stay focused on sexism, and not on race issues or ""hatred of capitalism"" and all that. &lt;3"

755,efk1x3l,"&gt;&gt; It does affect other people, especially working class women. I grew up in a working class area with a lot of Muslims and my friends and I were harassed DAILY by Muslim men. Muslim boys in our school used to refer to white girls as 'White sluts' and people would be harassed at school for looking like 'sluts'.

That wouldn't be an issue if you were segregated, would it? Did you look like a ""slut""... I mean obviously, It isn't an issue if you are surrounded by non muslims but if you're in a school that has a large population of Muslims then you probably should act accordingly.


&gt;&gt;If you think these archaic attitudes only affect Muslim women then you're quite ignorant. Also, even if it only affected Muslim women are we not supposed to care about them? Half of the Somali girls at my school underwent FGM. Are we supposed to ignore this because it's their 'culture?

Yes, that is exactly what you do, you ignore it and let them sort it out themselves, Who is this ""we"" that you speak of?

756,efnwcle,"Muslim women are the most evil . Growing up and being sh@ on by their families, they are taught to hate the infidel - as their male family members rape them ."
757,efrh283,"Please let me be perfectly clear: I do not generally view the forced covering of women as ""the cause"".  The only time there is a literal issue is extreme cases (Afghanistan comes to mind) where women are not even allowed to uncover for a doctor, and this has directly caused serious and even fatal health consequences (a tradition of oppressing women by keeping them chained instead of covered might have been less harmful because at least a doctor could see their problems).  I also do not support banning clothing, for numerous reasons, the first of which is that you cannot change people's beliefs by force of law, and instead can only infringe their freedom while creating deeper enmity, and this is as true for ""hate speech"" laws as it would be for hijab/burqua bans.  Laws that do not work are implicitly unethical.

So please let us move past ""illegal"", or clothing being ""the cause"" in any direct sense.

For the very most part, women keeping covered is a cultural symbol.  But this is where we must ask what kind of symbol, and/or a symbol of what attribute of the culture.  The answer to millions of heavily oppressed women is this: a symbol of their systematic oppression and abuse.  And we're not talking trivial oppression and abuse here.  A woman in Saudi Arabia might get her fucking head cut off in the street, literally executed with a sword, for the crime of being raped.  That is the oppression that begins with women being treated systematically as property to be protected, wrapped, hidden from view by others, instead of treated as free and autonomous individual human beings.

Many women who reject this systematic oppression cannot escape it, they remain bound, trapped in their culture, and suffering.

Can you forgive them for wishing that their sisters would reject what they rightly view as a key symbol of their oppression, whenever and wherever their sisters actually have the freedom to do so?  Can you see how desperately backwards it must seem to them for women with that freedom to celebrate the symbol of its antithesis?  It would be very much akin to proud German Jews flying the Swastika, as a symbol of a proud Germany, in spite of it also being the symbol of the Holocaust.  But at least a Swastika isn't a literal covering, a mantle literally placed on each Jew's actual body, unlike the hijab/burqua.  It's just a flag with a terrible history.

I will end by making a distinction here between hijab and burqua: the latter is obviously more oppressive, while the former is often closer to a fashion choice.  I simply note that bikinis are seldom allowed in combination, and that cultural expectation is a limit, an oppression, rather than a freedom.  Many Muslim women are free to choose to use that limitation as a symbol of their identity, while ignoring the fact that it is also literally a symbol of a limitation rather than a freedom.  Unfortunately many other Muslim women are not so free.

"
758,efvlo5x,"Looking at your post history, I don't think you know much about Islam or Muslims. You're not too different from those Muslims who grow up hating infidels because they read about them from biased sources and are taught that they're all evil monsters.

"
759,efyso6w,"I'll likely get downvoted for this comment, but here goes anyway. 

So what happens if a woman freely wants to wear the headscarf and is part of this century. Many brilliant women doctors, engineers, scientists, advanced scholars who wear the scarf out of their absolute free will and happen to be extremely productive and wonderful members of society. How do you reconcile that? Do you enforce that by going to these women and ripping their head scarfs by force, or do you ban them from being doctors, engineers, scientists until they take off their coverings?

This position is the same as the opposite side, where ultra religious people may say, ban the mini skirt or low cut tops because it is too sexually provocative and women should not wear such things. If you say that such ""revealing"" clothes is part of modern society and is a modern achievement, I can tell you that 1000's of years back, that was what women used to be like, revealing as well. 

I think the whole thing means only one thing, it is not about clothes, or attitude, it's a form of hidden anti-islamic prejudice that some people have. That is root cause for these calls. If it's not about clothes for muslims, they will find something else.

The whole thing is deeply disturbing and exposes the deep hypocrisy and hidden hatred that people have for certain religions and cultures, i.e. Islam. Much of it is till entrenched in the orientalist mindset, that somehow, Muslim women are enslaved by their menfolk and it is upto the enlightened west to free them from this slavery. How about people take away this lens and see the truth and treat everyone with respect and equity. Have you ever met and talked to Muslims about this and see how they feel about it, especially women who choose to wear the hijab? Ironic that many devout catholic politicians for example who have a disdain for Muslim women wearing the hijab, would revere catholic nuns, even though they were their own form of it.

Many Muslims are amazing citizens of western countries, they are well integrated productive human beings. They love and respect their fellow citizens, are loyal, law abiding citizens, whilst still being practicing Muslim, and in fact, many take their inspiration to be model citizens from Islam itself, despite what some people may believe. Most of those Muslims who have committed offenses and acts of major crimes, do so against every major tenet of Islam, and many times scholars have proven this by using multiple Islamic sources (most mass media does not take interest in this, they only play to the narrative that islam only=death and terror). 

This constant spotlight and suspicion against Muslims is being being perpetuated and exploited by many haters and achieves nothing apart from hatred, and division and makes the lives for many Muslims very difficult and especially tormonts Muslim women, as they are often subject of hateful stares and increasingly verbal and physical abuse in many western countries. Don't believe me, go and speak to Muslim women and find out what many of them have to go through, sadly, increasingly so. Again, this is not about the hijab or a certain garb, this is much more sinister. It is hidden hate and bigotry, the facts and experiences of many people prove this.

"
760,eg7o8hk,"This is a tricky situation. Muslim women are coming from a repressive way of thinking which forces them to wear head covering to appease to their religion and society, and coming to a situation that also requires them to have a dress code for public purposes. 

&amp;#x200B;

However dress codes for offices were always part of our society and well seems like they always will be. So if you agree with one way of thinking - aka making people wear something because of their religion and society, why not agree with Geneva way of thinking too. Because when you think about it, its a same situation. Being told to wear something, because you may offend someone. So if they agree with one restriction and rule on their clothing, why cant people appease to both demands in the same way. Why is the religion rule more important here than their political rule? Switzerland is a society based on kinda working public system and total democracy, which relies on people voting. They want to appear very neutral in many ways and unfortunately for many people religion symbols don't really spell neutral. So I get their way of thinking, but doesn't mean I totally agree with it. The ideal way would be to give women a chance to remove their headscarf whenever THEY want, and not being forced to either wear it or not wear it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I agree with not being forced to remove it, but however, I freaking hate when society and especially male society dominates you how to dress because you can offend someone. And yes I been to many arabic countries and when I had to I dressed according to their standards. Which kinda sucks, because I though male clothing seemed more fun for deserts and weather."

766,e80dl0b,"Here in France it's a bit fucked up.

We have many French from northern Africa. And the man will often ditch french north African women because they aren't deemed good enough. In fact not submissive enough. So they prefer marrying women who were raised in their country of origine.

So a part of those women are left with no marriage prospect in their own community. Some end up marrying other muslims who are often blck muslims with roots in countries like Mali or Senegal and they get lot and lot of hate for it from the men in their community. But it's their fault to begin with.

What kind of choices do they have ?

Not marrying and staying forever with their parents ?

Marrying a man from their country of origine who probably are doing that just to set a foot in Europe and who could perfectly ditch them as soon as they get their official papers ?

Marrying a black muslim dude who guenuinely like them ?

767,e86egw9,"&gt; Did *any* of us see this coming?

Yes. So, there were a bunch of people who were concerned by the low-key (to super obvious) Islamaphobia among a subset of people in the New Atheist movement. It was notable, but there was enough plausible deniability (""We don't hate Islam! We hate all religions!"") that most people could write it off.

In 2011, however, there was a major red flag with ""Elevatorgate"". A woman, in a video, mentions her experience at an atheist and skeptic conference, briefly mentioning a dude hitting on her at 4am in an elevator with only the two of them there. She doesn't say that it was sexual assault or anything; she doesn't name the man; she just said it made her uncomfortable and that men should be aware of that.

People started to flip the fuck out and in the exact way that you would expect. Richard Dawkins threw a bunch of wood onto the fire with his infamous ""Dear Muslima"" letter, which (summing up) basically said ""Don't complain about being uncomfortable because Muslim women are way more oppressed"".

The incident revealed that there was this huge split in the New Atheist movement. There were atheists who were atheists because they were decent people who believed that religion had failed a crucial moral test. They wanted to be better people and believed that religion was failing to do that (and, in fact, was making people worse). There's still a bunch of these people (including some big names) in the New Atheist movement.

And then there were those who were atheists because they didn't think that there should be anyone or anything telling them that they should change their behavior to be a better person.  This second group also was the type that loved rationalists smacking down creationists for the sheer drama of it. It was, therefore, pretty easy for them to transition to watching feminists get yelled on Youtube (""Feminist destroyed by logic!"") and into not-racist-just-asking-facts and eventually into conspiracy theories about Cultural Marxism.

There was other warning signs as well. Gamergate was a pretty big one; I won't go into that right now. People were even [joking about it back in 2014](https://i.imgur.com/INHgyPK.png).

Obviously, a lot of this is more obvious in hindsight, but there were a good number of people who noticed and tried to raise the alarm ... and were basically ignored."
768,e8an7zj,"Okay... So, your post is making several assumptions, so let's tackle them:

All countries use immigration. All countries used immigration for millennias. It's a normal, and while population decline does usually affect that, the actual issue is the availability of jobs, and fear of oppressive systems.

Muslims are not all uneducated, and don't universally hate your culture. You're attributing the traits of the vocal few to the masses that flee the inability to get educated, or the laws and methods that prevent them from practicing properly. I may not be in Europe, but here in Canada, muslim women are generally allowed to get a degree they couldn't get in Saudi Arabia (for instance), and are also allowed to have a job that doesn't include ""housewife"".

Not all babies will see a healthy birth. Miscarriages and stillborns do exist, and before you ask, no, I'm not even remotely saying that we should abort all babies in case they could be miscarriages or stillborns, I'm just saying that not all babies see the light of day even without abortion. 

Babies are considered legally separate entities by the World Health Organization (WHO) by the time it is expected that the first neurons (brain cells) begin to form. That usually happens ""somewhere in the second trimester of pregnancy"", which almost all (if not actually all) countries where abortion is legal already set as when abortion becomes illegal.

Not all unwanted pregnancies are caused by drunk sluts that get fucked by several men a night. Actually, most of them are from birth control accident, ot defective birth control, where the woman accidentally skipped a day on her pill, or the fallopian clamp broke/became undone, or botched vasectomies, or the condom just broke on the guy's dick while he was in. That is not to say that ""careless drunk sluts"" don't happen, but once again, that is attributing the extreme to the whole, and that's a bad thing to do.

Women physically cannot get pregnant more than 12 times a year... Assuming they do get pregnant every time they ovulate, then abort. That's biology 101.

Back to muslims: The guy that told that to you is a complete asshole, because unfortunately, that isn't how demographics work. See, if he is right, that means that at some point, muslims will have to work. The main reason we (caucasians) don't have more babies, is that we don't have time to raise more than one, or the occasional two. Not to count the fact that unlike what the boomer generation (those that got their 20's in the 60s, predominantly) seems to think: It isn't by hogging all the careers that could grant financial stability to future generations because ""they can still work just fine, why retire?"", that younger people will feel comfortable woth having babies when they aren't necessarily trying for one.

And for the final part of the argument, the Native Americans (which is what I strongly suspect you are calling Indians, here, since actual Indians are nowhere near extinct, and are in fact one of the most densely populated groups in the world) didn't get culturally invaded. They got completely invaded. Europeans went there, said ""this land is ours"", when Native Americans said ""no"", they would get slaughtered, and when they'd say yes, they'd have to move outside of their usual zone. Europeans turned them into reserves, pretending to protect their culture, turned them into curiosities, and then we shoved catholic priests in there for good measure, turning their spiritual beliefs into ridicule for the sake of proving Europeans were the superior race.

At the end of it all, the only part where I actually agree with you, is the part where you point out that rape pregnancies should be able to get aborted. The rest is either heavily biased racist assumptions targeting a non-issue with opinions that has no bearing on legislation, poorly researched facts with crappy tidbits anyone could research if anyone gave a shit, leading to assume stuff about people like Emmanuel Macron that probably isn't true, or if it is, probably not entirely true.

Oh, and I would also like to point one last thing out: I am 99.999% sure you're a man writing this, because none of the arguments you have raised there imply anything about love, which is what 100% of the women I met that are against abortion would say is their reason for being against it. ""It's my little baby, I love him already, and I don't want to lose that."" That means that to me, you just grabbed the nearest lot of pseudo-fitting reasons to justify wanting your genes to be passed down. I feel sorry for anyone having to deal with how your kids will be/are being raised."
769,e8p5q7n,"Front load tolerance and you'll eventually work up to cognatic succession. It will be a little weird getting marriages as no other Muslim realm on earth will put up with matrilineal marriages and sometimes you have to bribe dudes to court so you can marry them

770,e97365w,"Here's what the texts of Islam *actually* say about wife-beating:

* Mohammed condoned wife-beating when his men reported their wives were becoming emboldened toward their husbands. Beatings were deemed necessary to keep the women in their place. (Abu Dawud 2141 and Sahih Ibn Majah 9:1985)

* Mohammed hit this favorite wife, Aisha, in the chest when she left the house without his permission. (Sahih Muslim 4:2127) 

* Mohammed's fathers-in-law slapped two of Mohammed's wives for annoying him. Mohammed found this funny and laughed in response. (Sahih Muslim 9:3506) 

* Mohammed declared that a man will not be asked as to why he beat his wife. (Abu Dawud 2142 and  Sunan Ibn Majah 3:9:1986)

* Mohammed's *favorite wife* complained that Muslim women are abused worse than other women. (Sahih Bukhari 72:715)  

* A woman came to Mohammed and begged him to stop her husband from beating her. Her skin was bruised so badly that it is described as being greener than the green veil she was wearing. Mohammed did not admonish her husband. Instead, he ordered the woman to return to her husband and submit to his sexual desires. (Sahih Bukhari 72:715)  

* A Muslim man who expected a a virgin for a wife found out she was pregnant. Mohammed told him to treat her as a rape slave and whip her after she gives birth. (Abu Dawud 2126) 

* Muslim men are required to ""lightly beat"" any married woman who ""acts in a sexual manner toward others."" Merely being alone with a man to whom she is not related qualifies for this. (Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 969)

* Mohammed said, ""Hang up your whip where your wife can see it."" (al-Zamkhshari Vol. 1, p. 525) 

* Wives can be beaten. (Koran 4:34, Ishaq 969, Muslim 4:2127, Abu Dawud 2141 and 2142, Tabari IX:113)

Ahmad Muhammad Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, the head of ""Al-Azhar,"" Sunni Islam's most prestigious institution, says that [""light beatings"" and ""punching"" are part of a program to ""reform the wife.""](http://archive.is/5jdeh)

The Koran is indistinguishable from any other form of hate literature.

Do not be fooled. Read the Koran, ahadith, and sira for yourself. Read, understand, refute, educate others.

**Fight back. Fight them. FIGHT.**"
771,e6antwt,"They hate someone they never met, which is all that needs to be said. Perhaps they are worried how this interfaith marriage will work. Does she intend to convert? Is that a requirement of your Faith? Maybe that's their issue. Maybe they're worried she will be oppressed, because that is how Muslim women are often described in America... with the Hijabs and such. If that's the case, your concerns are insurmountable. If you plan to have a conventional western marriage, no conversion or Hijab, then hopefully they will come to their senses and learn who you really are."
772,e7mz4it,"It’s more to do with the type of comments that occur on certain types of content. For example, anytime there is anything even mildly relating to Muslim women or posted by a woman who happens to be Muslim, the comments are non stop chock full of the same repetitive and cliche 
mantras / commentary on the hijab. Muslim women in general have been highly politicised and can’t even be present or visible it feels without this commentary. We simply don’t get the same level of commentary on the attire of non Muslim women.

To illustrate, I for one find the concept of bra’s to be sexist and oppressive, I absolutely hate wearing them, but I personally feel *compelled* to; another woman however may love them. I don’t presume a universality of my perspective nor try to impose it on all women, nor shame a woman for liking what I dislike, nor try to imply that she simply has said opposing perspective because she’s *not educated or enlightened yet on why my perspective is correct and the most feminist*. Nor do I rally that the bra *itself* is a disgusting patriarchal symbol and all women who wear one are without agency and oppressed by it. 

I wish the same level of courtesy could be given to Muslim women in relation to the hijab; some are forced to wear them, some are not. Yet there is often an inherent underlying assumption that all Muslim women are compelled by some patriarchal force to don this scarf, and that the scarf *itself* is a symbol of patriarchy that Muslim women need to be *liberated* from. I wish there could be a more nuanced understanding &amp; acceptance that it is the matter of being *forced to wear / or not wear anything* that is oppressive, not the item itself, and trying to remove someone’s agency through such rhetorical constructions of what is ‘reality’ is at best really rude and presumptive, at worst, oppressive. 

This is just intended as an illustrative example of the types of Eurocentrism I’m talking about, but extends to other topics and realms of discussion.  

The best thing to do to better understand would be to do some self guided research on the key concepts discussed, as it is really far too exhaustive a topic to even really be superficially exemplified in a comment. Just beginning with a basic google search of key phrases / questions such as: Issues with White Liberal Feminism, why intersectionality is struggling, why Postcolonial Feminism is even a ‘thing’, Eurocentrism in Feminism, returns quite a lot of content that could form the beginnings of a good foundation to work from. 

"
773,e4wp93y,"Of course not. But how many Islamic women are victims of female genital mutilation across the Middle East and Africa? I reckon that society-approved practice has affected numbers of children just like Church-sanctioned child rape - yet it’s still a tiny minority of people affected, not a majority. If one limits his focus to finding things to hate about religion, he’ll certainly find it. My point is, let’s find things to promote about atheism rather than being a Debbie Downer complaining about religion every day."
774,e5s7yrs,"You can say the same thing about Christianity. If religion makes you a terrible person who hates gays and you're one to shove your religion down peoples throats, I hate you. I don't hate your religion. I just hate you. My parents are Muslim but they're not strict. They don't pray everyday. They don't wear the hijabs. I was born into the Muslim religion and I grew out of it at a very young age. 
I think it's pretty wise when an 8 year old can make that decision for herself. To think for yourself is the best blessing I can imagine. 
I don't hate religion. I just truly hate what it brings out in some people. Which is the worst.
As for the a whole sexist part.. yeah my boyfriend try to argue that w me. Sexism exists outside of religion too believe it or not. Islamic women are just modest. They choose to be that way. I say that because I chose to not be that way. I don't know. 
I get where your opinion is coming from. I guess it just doesn't seem true from my case and point of view. But I can see how someone would think that. "
775,e4op16z,"&gt; I mean it's 100% not that the Middle East has different attitudes towards women or anything.  
  
It's not just that. Some of them are fine with women. Sure, maybe they don't take them super seriously and such, but they are fine with women.   
But they fucking HATE non-Muslims and therefore non-Muslim women are filthy useless whores to them from the get go. This is something I have experienced in Sweden. Some treated Muslim women with some good humour and courtesy (not saying the same as men, they didn't respect them the same), but the moment I spoke or did anything it was all eye rolls and ""the stupid unbeliever bitch needs to know her place"".   
They don't target local women just for being women, but they think the unbeliever is up for grabs for whatever. Being not one of THEIR women is part of the reason; at least their own women have some value. We do not. "

Yeah. It's both gender and religious identity combined which creates the shitty attitude. Not surprised. In-group out-group preferences taken to an extreme. 

Fuck these people"
777,e5bygch,"&gt;Many men also have ideas about how much of a woman's body should be reserved for her partner. When they see evidence of a woman showing more than is normal, men will generally see that as a sign of sexual availability or promiscuity. This is biology and sociology at work. They shouldn't be seen as the same thing; being nude isn't ""asking for it"". But nevertheless, it's a well-known aspect of human psychology.

those parts usually differ from one place to another. depending on how much of the female body is sexualized. in muslim cultures it seems to cover the entire female form, there is no such thing as feminine without being sexual, feminitity = sexuality = should be preserved for a sexual partner. and the women who choose to not follow such dictations are asking for male attention and have cuckolded family members. this is something buried deep into the minds of most people, they can't comprehend much behind that, the good thing however is that we are seeing a change, more and more muslim women are coming out with relaxed coverings, more interest into fashion, this interest comes from both hijabis and non-hijabis, i see the hijabi fashion as a good thing that will gradually normalize femininity in public as it is coming from the more mainstream section of the society.

but however i see the role that religion plays into that and i become upset, if you want your wife to be fully for you go on, but the problem when they think that this is the perfect model for humanity, and when they promote it, i think that this is a subjective matter, some men will be ok with their women not being covered in public, some won't. no issue here but religions doesn't work like that. and muslims being members of islam think it is a duty on them to promote their lifestyle and criticize the choices of others. why i'm uspet with that? will because i want more diversity in the world, and this diversity won't happen if people didn't stand up and criticize them, if there was only one voice dominating the intellectual  space, this voice will dominate in reality. secondly because of philosophical reasons. i don't see what harm does it do if a woman isn't wearing a hijab in public, she is being sexual ? relative subject, she will be more likely to harassed and objectified ? we should find other solutions than hiding women, she is making herself accessible to the eyes of men ? again relative subject each woman decide for herself what others can see of her. muslims who believe that the hijab is an obligation won't accept a society where people choose what they do based on their preferences, they however will try to make promote hijab by all costs, if not by creating theories like that, will simply be saying that it is an obligation and women who won't do it will be punished in after-life.it is important to stand up for them so that people see different ways and choose what fits them, instead of just one voice being heard, why i hate the liberal reaction to it ? because they are the taking the side of those who are pro-hijab, rather than those who reject the idea that we can't have a society  functioning well without all women being covered in public. they are making it hard for reformers in islamic countries and are standing in the way of progress.


&gt;I think culture and religion are a bit intertwined and interchangeable in many areas. Both the Koran and the Bible explicitly state that women should wear head coverings. In places where head coverings are the cultural norm, you will see both Muslim and Christian women wearing head coverings. 

but christains follow authorities that tell them that head coverings aren't an obligation, muslim follow authorities that tell them that it is, this is the difference,can you bring me one living christian that believe that women should cover their hair in public ? plus, in Egypt christian women just wear what they want to wear, some may wear head coverings (especially in rural areas) vast majority won't, this is how things used to be with muslims too, you go in a muslim country in prior to the 70s you see muslim women wearing all forms of clothing, this ended when islamists came with the belief that the hijab is an obligation on women and succeeded into making it the mainstream position. 

&gt;We should strive to make it socially unacceptable for men to give unwanted sexual attention to women regardless of what she's wearing.



this should be the priority i agree. 



"
778,e5s8gdj,"I know, but one would think that a society that had any will for survival or self-preservation would have at least realized that on the fist 9/11. Alas we had the treasonous elite not only hide and obscure that fact from us, but they then propagandized and controlled us and psychologically manipulated the feeble minded liberals into capitulation to Osama Bin Laden's goals of islamic conquest of the west. 

I have driven past a brand new school, paid for by white slave tax payers, to which hijab wearing muslim women are bringing their 5 children and the other adults are a mix of central Americans and Indians without a single white person in sight.  That's what is happening. And they will now be ""educated"" by muslim and communist/socialist ""teachers"" to hate the USA based on liberal socialist created lessons that are even infiltrating the Texas education system. 

What is essentially happening is a grow your own conquering and occupying invasion force right within the USA to poison us from within. These children of these invaders have absolutely no loyalty to the USA and they have utter disregard and contempt for what white people created for them and foolish treasonous liberals stole and gave away to them for free. 

The Islamic and savage cancer will only continue to fester and eat its way through its host.  Reality simply is that actual immigration of Europeans that were far more like the Europeans that were already in the USA than not and were forced to integrate and work hard to build and become America due to being cut off from their source country, is NOT the same thing as invaders that are flown in for free, given others' things for free, and even given greater privileges and advantages in our society than white people who built the USA, while maintaining their connections to their source country through global communications is nothing short of invasion and conquest and colonization and theft. This is an invasion, because ""immigration"" has changed and is not what it used to be. Immigration is conquest. 

#The USA is being conquered right before the military's eyes!!!!"
779,e5sq0mk,"Do they know that there are cases where muslim women are literally assaulted and forced to take off their headscarves?

These fuckers dont care about women or anyone that are supposed to be ""victims of islam"" they just hate islam because a lot of muslims are not white.
"
780,e3d00k0,"“Well they’re fucking wrong”

See as a conservative I agree with you. But, we also need to realize that while their culture is despicable to us in many ways the same goes with them. Many Muslim women are ok with the backwards culture they have and while I think it’s shit they don’t. Only God(in my opinion) can truly decide what is justice and what is wrong. I hate that this happened as much as you do but, I don’t think we are in a place to judge. Because, they may feel the same way about things in our culture."
781,e3l0har,"&gt;  also be opposed to treating women like chattel. 

Anti-Muslim types despise Muslim women most of all. Muslim women are the main victims of anti-Muslim hate crimes. Most anti-Muslim legislation targets women exclusively. 

So let's not pretend it's about 'women's rights.' "
782,e3mbbmy,"Christians reformed and moved with the times. Islam has not reformed, and those attempting to start a Reformation, often Muslim women, are being labeled as hate-speakers."
783,e42xe1d,"As much as I like Rowan Atkinson I think he's missed the mark here. I agree absolutely that religion is open to mockery, especially when it comes to its more pernicious affects on society. However it is also important to draw a distinction between mocking the institution and the doctines, and mocking the adherents. Obviously there is an overlap in those 2 categories but it in this case it seems clear that Boris Johnson's critique is superficial and sophomoric. BoJo's comments are mocking Muslim women for the absurdity of their appearance based on their religious attire. Saying that women who wear the Burka and the Niqab look like ""letterboxes"" and ""bank robbers"" is not a penetrating critique of Islam, it's outright bigotry designed to pander to the British far-Right. 

There is a reasonable debate to be had on what the Burka and Niqab represent to our society without demonising a minority group. Recent studies indicate that Muslim women are the most persecuted group in Britain as they suffer the trifecta of being 1. Female, 2. A religious minority, 3. An ethnic minority. I personally hate the Burka, Niqab, and the Hijab, they represent the worst of religious patriarchy and are demonstrative of an antiquated worldview - having said that I am not granted the authority to tell women what they can and cannot wear as then I too would be guilty of the same condescending paternalism that I am criticising Islam for. I also argue that it shows enormous bravery in certain cases that Muslim women still go out in public wearing this attire, full well knowing that it marks them as an other and threatens them with abuse. "
784,e3djuri,"Think your getting that hate as most Islamic men are circumsized.

Its nit in the big book, but in the little ones..."
785,e14bl73,"You bring a lot of valid points however when the office A/C becomes sexist. Things start to get a little silly. 

You have “real” feminists fighting the hijab in the Middle East. Fighting for the ability to drive a car like the freedom a man has in those countries. 

There’s women over there that will be thrown in jail and possibly put to death over their head covering being worn incorrectly. Muslim women are predominantly baby making material. They get to a certain age they stop education get married and off they go. 

Here women have certainly challenges associated with their sex. Sociologically they have a much easier time in the West to better themselves. I don’t buy the Misogyny label, yes it happens but at such a smaller scale when compared to the Islamic States. No one is perfect statistics are what they are but people need to over come their biological variables don’t you agree?

The western world has become to caught up in the PC culture. It’s because of that it’s caused us I believe to regress. I know lots of women that would laugh at the gender pay gap. The same women will laugh at misogyny, most men that hate women or are sexist towards them had a bad childhood growing up. Not always but in most cases (no source) but it’s a factor. 


If you want to find a place where there’s no sociological difference. It doesn’t exist we’re all human we’re all deeply flawed. It’s how we deal with it and being a special snowflake isn’t dealing with it.

786,e14xb94,"Who are you to dictate what and what isn't liberating, feeling or empowering to women? So, a women who wears headscarfs isn't any of those things and a women who doesn't wear a headscarf Is? So tell me then, are nuns oppressed? They cover themselves much like Muslim women, are they too brainwashed? Or do you only jump on the bandwagon when it's all anti Muslim? 

And it's funny how it's only westerners like you who shout oppressive and all sorts when it comes to the way we dress. It they really are oppressed, why aren't they behind you? We live in the age of the internet now, where's all the pages where oppressed Muslim women go to? Where's the movement? Funny how it's only oppressive to the people who hate Islam. Don't you think? You can go to any part of the world, from the biggest cities to tiny villages and you'll see people dressed completely differently to you and the way people in the society around you dress. And just because you're brainwashed to view women as flesh and sexualized meat doesn't mean women who cover up for various reasons are oppressed because you're too ignorant to realise we all don't follow what western society does. 

Even the point of Muslim women on social media, you still can't stand that they have their own voice can you? You're a pathetic person. You're so obsessed with painting Islam as evil that even when you see Muslim women doing things that they choose to do and are expressing themselves freely, you can't stand it and still try to argue it. That's what people like you do. 

And it's funny how you mention what's normal doesn't mean it's always right or should be acceptable. In my opinion, western society sexualising women and brainwashing them into viewing themselves as objects for guys to drool over shouldn't be acceptable and just because it's normal for YOU, doesn't mean it's right. See, we all view what's normal differently and you're In no position to dictate to me and to billions of muslims what your ignorant and smallminded view of ""normal"" is. If it was up to guys like you, you'd happily have women half naked walking down the streets in your ""normal"" world. Thankfully Muslim women are smart enough to make their own choices and they don't need people like you trying to control them. "
787,e1d4rmp,"Why don’t you talk to a practicing burka-clad Muslim woman and find out. I’m sure they’d be happy to answer your questions if you’re polite about it.

Edit: I just thought to add that I am Muslim and I wear a hijab (head scarf that does not cover the face). I was not forced to wear it, I follow the Qur’an in which I am commanded by God to wear it as a woman and with good reasoning that I understand clearly and accept. 

Interesting side-fact: my husband was actually against it even though he is practicing and didn’t want me to wear hijab at first, but he let me make that choice and quickly realized the good it brought out in me and how people interacted with me. It really helped centre me and my obsession with how I looked and dressed. Personally, I also find it helped people really pay attention to what I was saying and not what I looked like, which was refreshing and life changing. Honestly, I feel more grounded, I feel validated, and I feel like I finally have the power in my hands after years of being harassed and ogled by random strangers. 

I love wearing hijab and I think that most Muslim women who practice do too. As far as my daughter goes, we left the choice to her and she has chosen to wear it and has even started her own Hijab business at the age of 14. Her dad and I asked her, more like begged her, to really think about it and make the right choice for herself when she came to us announcing her decision to start wearing  it full time. We didn’t want her to just do it because I was, we wanted her to understand why we do it and what she should expect (intense glares, prejudices, and all). She did her research and made a calculated decision for herself and we are proud of her level of maturity. These are her personal choices and we are only there to guide her through them, not make them for her.

Muslim women are not the oppressed, backwards, victims that everyone makes us out to be. Just like there is abuse, forced relationships, and domestic and sexual violence here in Western societies (the stats are actually staggering), the same is true for Muslim countries and households. Just like Western men justify their evil deeds against women with religion, addiction, mental health issues, bad childhoods or some messed up manifestation of their wayward masculinity so do Muslim men. If a man wants to do harm or use force, he will find whatever excuse he wants. He will hide behind scripture or scotch just to get away with his crimes, so we should all be aware of this game. 

I have studied my religion and I know that this is not what it states. There isn’t any compulsion in this religion and yet people will misquote and manipulate from all sides, from within and from outside, to justify their misdeeds and hate. We should all be more responsible and see everything from all sides, not just the one that is most convenient to us or what seems to be similar to our own narrow world view. There’s always more to the story, don’t judge too quickly. Like I said, if you’re curious, speak to people who are actually living it and read from authentic sources. 

Thank you for hearing me out. Sorry for the length. I wrote the comment and came back to edit, because I was like, “hey, I’m a Muslim woman, I can answer that!” Again, I don’t wear burka or the face veil (I’m not convinced of the scripture sources that women site for it), but I believe every woman should have the right to choose her clothing. If we begin forcing women to dress how we want them to, then does that make us any better than the so-called oppressors we claim to be fighting? I think not.

As humans, if we do not have the freedom to choose, then what do we really have?"
788,e1ikrig,"Wow!  How arrogant, condescending &amp; patronising!?!

If you move to a big city wear a bunch of people speak your language, and you can still buy mostly the same food-your cultural awareness can only expand. Culture is not a rope you have to cut and drop the second you move, culture is what you carry with you- it is your believes, your home, the way you interact with your family, the music you listen to, the language you speak. Parts may naturally drop away, little by little as you adapt or change but stripping is the wrong the word. You choose the parts of your new home you want to adapt culture and location do not go hand in hand. Just because I live in SoCal does that mean I need to give up eating buffalo meat and become a vegan? Does my dog need to be a vegan?
 The language you are using implies force, I know that is not your intention, but the implication from so many people having their culture and beliefs forced out from under them and being ""stripped"" and ""robbed"" of their culture means that you have to- you have to give up the things you hold dear to be somewhere else. But that is not how culture really works. Jews in the Netherlands still celebrate pass-over, just like they do in the US and Canada and Israel. Nobody is stopping them from doing so and it would be wrong, we have (hopefully) established that. Why is the burka any different from pass over, or wearing a cross around your neck, or eating fish, or putting chocolate in children's shoes? It harms no one, it only signals differentness, nothing more. The claims people have about security are bs, I could easily wear a disguise, there is makeup that fools facial recognition. And if I wanted to hide a weapon I could do it just as easily under a dress as I could burka. I cannot understand why people think trying to force anyone, especially people that have no where else to go (I am betting a lot of these muslim women are refugees), to strip away their culture because ""they are in this culture now"" "
791,dzfjghf,"Lol the whores and the evil doers and the world wants to kill me anyways for being a virgin, what's it is to them if I die a virgin? Lol so the white women will all be turned into whores by the worst of the wicked male whores of the other races whilst their women are turned into whores by the white Chads? Sounds like they're about even to me.  Never said I was holding out for a perfect virgin white girl, I mean I'll take one lol, but personally I don't mind if she is another race or all that, but there is shit that comes along when mixing the races whether you like it or not.

Lol you don't get it, there's still some quality white women left, but yes many are whores or just totally cruel and evil and guess what it's the same for the other races too.  You don't like white women I know because of your mother, and I can empathize to that that's how I know how fucked up white women are too and mine was fucked up.  Yet the difference is with Chads ya'll go off and fuck women of other races sure, but you acting then like just the same guys that fucked your mother.  For me though my mother did a lot of shit I don't hate her deep down, I do love her, and that's why I do not do wickedly like her or like my father, and my father was Chad as well, not too sure about yours, I understand it's common for a lot of the whites these days to have the Chad dad or betabux dads are common or cucks or sadly even what not many people talk about is no dads for their dads were evil and made them into bastards and a lot of them hate their moms and not without good reason but then they go off and become like the wicked men that made themselves into bastards and do so to the next generation.

It's not so much that I want to stay a virgin, but I don't want the fucking curses that come along with the Easy Ways Out that all lead to whoredom or death.  And secondly I would prefer to be married and love my woman so fully and have the One and be her One and love each other to the fullest.  Not just love each other in sex either which is what a lot of the Chads and various normies get wrong about being a virgin, I want to have a woman and we love each other utterly in every way.  However I am getting old I am also preparing myself to go full volcel, in which case that's not a bad path at all that is in fact one of the highest most glorious paths of all in the eyes of God whom created, preserved, blessed, cursed, and will end, resurrect, save, and condemn all the races.

Lol hey you stumbled upon a funny truth here actually.  It is ironic the Muslim women are very well suited to white male virgins, but there's a catch in there.  In Islam, a wicked devilish false religion those women are basically slaves to men and besides the stereotypical evil shit they do to women, very importantly a woman's religion is regarded as that of her husband despite her own personal beliefs.  So this is the great barrier really to the righteous whitecels and the muslimacels that are actually in almost every other way perfect matched because if she marries a non-muslim she is now an apostate and must die according to the demonic lies of the sorcerer Chadmohammad.

As for expecting white guys to stay pure, I don't expect that at all.  I know how wicked the world is, both the men and women are for the most part whores, there's very few real virgins out there of both, especially as you get older.  They are whores, they condemn themselves to and created many of these problems by their whoredom and they understand it not, both the men and the women.  They could repent they could turn away from their whoredom, but they do not, and they hate each other and they hate male virgins, but the male virgins are not the oens that fucked them, they even are the same ones that fucked each other because they are fuckers.

792,dzuakkk,"No no, you didn’t sound insensitive, probably my fault jumping straight into my response. I’m just replying to a few and hate typing on my phone, so my fault for sounding short on my reply 😊


According to the Quran, only Muslim men can marry Christian/Jewish women. Muslim women are not allowed to marry outside of Islam. There is an argument against this, but I think it is quite a liberal idea that few hold to. "
793,e02aazv,"&gt; This has nothing to do with Islam

Reminder that Islam's views of women are inherited directly from Judeo-Christian tradition. 

I do like how you guys always try to play the MUH WIMMINZ RIGHTS card. Doesn't really work considering the fact that Muslim women are the main victims of anti-Muslim hate. "
794,e02riuz,"&gt;Reminder that Islam's views of women are inherited directly from Judeo-Christian tradition.

So, Mohamed *didn't* get his information from Gabriel? He just copypasta'd swaths of the bible and ran with it? Even if that were true, it doesn't explain why Christian history doesn't have instances of women being stoned to death and not being kept in full coverings. Roman Christian women certainly weren't violently forced to be kept covered. The religions clearly deviate in a litany of different ways.

&gt;I do like how you guys always try to play the MUH WIMMINZ RIGHTS card. Doesn't really work considering the fact that Muslim women are the main victims of anti-Muslim hate.

So because anti-Muslim violence against Muslim women exists, we should ignore things like honor killings and stonings? Nah. All of it's condemnable, you can't use a whataboutism to ignore barbarism against women just because you think it helps your narrative.
"
795,e07a76e,"Your current view is based on a misunderstanding of the situation in 1946.  The land was split according to population density, with the Jewish areas under Jewish control and the Arab areas under Arab control.  But it did not say that Jews had to live here and Arabs had to live there.  

After the state was declared by the UN, the surrounding Arab nations immediately attacked, and Israel managed to fight them off.  

If we look at the middle east today, we see Muslim dominated countries with almost 0 diversity, because repeated attacks by Muslims on ethnic and religious minorities either killed or drove them off.  Whereas Israel has Jews, Christians, Arabs, and Druze, living side-by-side in relative peace and harmony.  

[Hamas teaches children to hate Israelis and to play by pretending to kill Jews.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRuuDI0KCR8)


So when you want to blame Israel as the antagonist, I suggest you take a closer look at the behavior of Muslims in Arab-dominated countries today, before you start pointing fingers.


Lastly, I find it interersting that you are so concerned with Palestinians, and aren't paying any attention to what China is doing to Turkic Muslims in Ughyrstan.  That is real oppression.  The name Mohamed is outlawed.  All prominent cultural leaders were sent to re-education camps, men are not allowed to have beards, and Muslim women are being forced to marry Chinese men to start the integration process.

So if your so concerened about the fate of Muslims, China is your real problem.  Unless you're just more concerned with Jews...  "
796,e0ugrhr,Thats not a mother. I hate how alot of muslim women are barriers to other woman in trouble in islam.
797,dyr1gcj,"&gt; We are a single, global human family. A single, global human race. We are one tribe. One global community. We are one. Nothing divides us. If we are not able to come to terms with this fact, then we will not survive. It is really that simple.

Ah, good ole colorblind racism. Using the guise of multiculturalism to justify her racist exploits, claiming we live in a post-racial society while ignoring decades of structural and institutional racism. Her views on hate speech against Muslim women are equally misguided. "
798,dywyk03,Muslik men don't get enough hate. They're disgusting sexist pigs. Muslim women are okay though.
799,dz9bf5r,"Muslims don't hate other religions, Jesus and moases are views the same as Mohammed, not all Arabs are Muslim, they're are almost 2 billion Muslims and there are less than 200 million Arabs, not all Muslims hate gays, and Muslim women are not forced to wear hijab. It's their choice.  "
800,dzbs64z,"Two months ago I sat in a circle surrounded by 56 young Muslim American women from across the country, of various ethnic and religious adherence backgrounds. We were at the National Muslim Women’s Summit and we were discussing being Muslim and woman in America, a conversation I opened mostly to allow space for conversation around hate-crimes. Instead, stories of gendered isolation in religion and religious spaces began to unfold. In a time of #MeToo and an incredible feminist wave, we as young Muslim American women are recognizing that our Islamic institutions, marred by cultural patriarchal traditions, were never truly safe for us.

I remember every time I was forced to the back and bottom of mosques where male religious leaders became neither visible nor audible, disrupting my worship. I remember every time my body was policed and controlled in religious spaces. I remember when I went away for college and was told that I was “not religiously appropriate” because I did not have a “male companion.” I’m thinking about the recent case of Noura Hussein and how under the guise of manipulated religious law she is punished and shamed for defending herself, even after being a victim of rape and early child marriage. I am thinking about the ways in which even in Mecca, our holiest site, our bodies are violently assaulted. This year, my close friend was sexually assaulted by her Muslim Student Association President only to be silenced by her Muslim community. The high profile case of sexual manipulation of Nouman Ali Khan, that ended with him still being regarded as a lecturer in the community. And of course, we all know the many cases of sexual abuse and violence at the hands of religious scholars and preachers. And I can go on and on and on. From lack of representation in religious leadership, to domestic violence in homes to sexual violence at the hands of clergy, I have personally seen “Islam” being used to justify the silencing and aggression of many of my Muslim sisters. And if we somehow do end up engaging leaders who are not violent or in mosque spaces that are safe, we carry traumas that our communities never really tried to help us heal.

Even in the face of both racial and gender violence, Muslim women are a source of beautiful mobilization around the world. It was only the grassroots organizing of Saudi women for years that finally granted them the right to drive. Starting this year Muslim women in Tehran will no longer be arrested for not wearing the hijab and it is only because of the love and labor of their movement building. Sudanese women pushing back against the legal system in their country for Noura Hussein’s freedom are the reason behind the international amplification of this case. In America, it is women like Blair Imani, Leah Vernon, Dalia Mogahed, Robina Niaz, Dr. Intisar Rabb, Zahra Billoo, Linda Sarsour and Darakshan Raja (and hundreds of others) who are at the forefront of doing the work that is empowering all of us. And in most of our homes, it is the grandmothers, mothers, aunts and sisters who are with less sleep, working for hours with love to feed our souls before our bellies.

During this holy month of Ramadan, I am committing to holding my sisters tighter and recognizing that this faith is held and built by us women. Before this modern day manipulation, violence and silencing, we all know that the tradition of our scholarship was lead by Muslim women and that the first to accept Islam were women.

Through #MyFeministRamadan, I want to affirm and recognize the power and courage that it takes for many Muslim sisters to find love and connection with God, despite the violent manifestations of patriarchy that our religious institutions impose on us. I want to affirm and recognize how much strength and courage it takes for you to engage with religious leaders and communities that have policed and harmed you. Especially for my sisters who live at the intersections of various identities, I honor and see your healing processes and affirm your journey as you, everyday, fight, reclaim and redefine the ways in which you manifest your religion. Like the many women who came before me, this Ramadan is one where I am going to love God with all the strength of my womanhood.

And for those who are in our community who do not identify as women, how will you make these spaces safer for all of us?"
801,dw9iose,"IS doesn't ""hate women"", it treats women as per Islam which says woman is worth half a man and the Muslim women are fine with it. What is modern feminism before Allah, who grants Jannat to true believers?"
802,dw9rajb,"&gt;Ok 
&gt;
&gt;""as Western society *not* traditionally held that women are subservient?""
&gt;
&gt;I will lead you to the intersectional feminist. See feminist teach me that Islam is a feminism religion. Wearing a burka and things like that shouldn't been seen by our western eyes and we should be emphatic. 
&gt;
&gt;Hence, we should see women that lived in that time with the same value as the society at that time. St this time, for a women, that was the carrier and a lot of women were perfectly fine with this. Just my grand mother was one of the first women to work where I come from and she left her work when she married my grand-father and she was happy about that. So if you say it's being oppressed, well Muslim women are oppressed and feminist should do something about it. 

Before a person can clean up another person's house, they have to clean their own. And would you *really* want someone who didn't understand your culture going into your nation and telling your nation's people that everything they're doing is wrong?

As far as women in Western countries wearing burkhas or not working? If they *choose* to do those things, it isn't oppression. Oppression is a result of not *having* a choice, or being discouraged by society from *making* that choice.

If staying at home is what a woman really wants, then society telling her she *has* to work would be oppression as well.

This is why I said *Western* society, specifically. If I want things in my society to change, I have to step up and make it happen. But I can't move into, say, Qatar, and *make* the people there stand up. They have to enact their own change.

&gt;Ok for the politic, I will ask you another question. Women are the majority in education, nurse and thing like that. Is there any ""feminiarchy"" that keep man out of those work field? Does that make any sens to you? 
&gt;
&gt;So why feminist push for that, but won't push for more men in women work field ? How's that not a double standard?
&gt;
&gt;You need to be very ignorant to push the fault on man. 

Why do men not actively seek to be more active in those fields? The only way more men will enter those fields is if they choose to. The stigma that was once associated with men in the nursing profession is no longer there.

Men have been heavily invested in the teaching profession for millenia, since the earliest days of Western society. For more men to become teachers, they have to *choose* to do so.

With that said, I also know that in the last few years it's become a bit harder for men to associate with children, at least in the US. That's part of why some men *don't* choose to teach. They're afraid of being accused of child molestation. That is a very serious problem in American society right now, and one that needs to be addressed.

I am not blaming *men* for the way Western society works. I blame society and its values. It just happens that most of those values were put in place *by* men.

&gt;Ok for black Indian and Indian, i don't know. I can comment on that topic. But I can ask you why there is no white in African politic? Like white farmer are being killed and nobody give a shit about them. 

Because there is racism in African society, obviously. But I can't do anything about that, can I? I have no involvement with African society.

That is, again, why I'm addressing *Western* society. I am in Western society. My voice actually counts here.

I never suggested that only white people can be racist.

&gt;Stop mixing everything together. 

No. It all ties together.

&gt;If you aren't a feminist, why are you defending them

Because while I may not use the name, I do agree with many of the basic ideals. Similarly, I do not call myself a Men's Rights Advocate, though I agree with many of the basic ideals.

Why do I not, then, call myself a feminist or MRA? Because both groups have people who have way too much hate in their hearts for my taste.

&gt;And arguing with me?

Why did you come here to start an argument?

&gt;Why do you want to change my mind?

Because I disagree with you, but I don't believe you're unreasonable. If you were, you'd have started insulting me in worse ways than calling me dumb long ago."

809,dxo7w0b,"[Not sure what unnamed study Tapley is citing, but according to statscan information the original status of womens report is citing she is it's incorrect.](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/171128/t001d-eng.htm)

If the article is correct and Tapley is citing [This older 2012 information](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2014001/article/14028/t/tbl07-eng.htm) or [this](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2014001/article/14028-eng.htm#a10)then the accuracy of her response should be questioned as that is extremely out of date and the status of women report is working off of data from 2016. Although it may not seem like 4 years can make a difference consider the following. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


**2012**



Total hate crimes: 1414


Religiously motivated: 419 (30%)


Against Jews:  242, That's 17% total hate crimes or 58% of religiously motivated.


Against Muslims: 45, That's 3% total hate crimes or 11% of religiously motivated.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


 
**2016**



Total hate crimes: 1409


Religiously motivated: 460 (32%)


Against Jews: 221  That's 16% total hate crimes or 48% of religiously motivated.


Against Muslims: 139  That's 10% total hate crimes or 30% of religiously motivated.



Not only is it a dramatic increase in the percent of religiously motivated hate crimes against Muslims but it's also a very large increase of incidents as well, going from 45 incidents in 2012 to 139 in 2016.


I am not sure why the immigration minister decided to use the 2012 report to criticize the report but Tapley does herself a disservice by using it.
 Not only because it brings question to her credibility for choosing outdated information, but the most recent statistics actually do prove that not only are religiously motivated hate crimes growing in frequency but they are in fact more increasingly targeted at Muslims. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;



&gt;To put another nail into the Status of Women’s claim that Muslim women are “far more likely to be victims of hate crime” in Canada, the Immigration Department official clarified that most victims of violent hate crimes, 72 per cent, are men.

This information is provided on [table 5.](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/171128/t001d-eng.htm) 

 If she had read the notes on the table she would have also come across this.
&gt;Information on victims is limited to incidents involving violent offences.

The problem with using violent offences to determine the gender for the entire group is that violent offences make up less than one third of all hate crimes for that year. She is conflating two very different figures to make her point. Total hate crimes by gender versus  total violent crime by gender.


There are a few more points in the article that are factually incorrect, because they use non-related but similar sounding statistics to conflate two topics and then offer them as proof of argument. However as I cannot tell if it is Tapley who made those points or the articles author is misrepresenting her, it's a waste of time posting them. "
810,dxoi1mp,"I do not think you took the time to read what casualguitarist wrote. 
If it helps let me clarify his point for you.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;





This is the quote as it appears in the article:





&gt;To put another nail into the Status of Women’s claim that Muslim women are “far more likely to be victims of hate crime” in Canada, the Immigration Department official clarified that most victims of violent hate crimes, 72 per cent, are men.

    
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

   
Casualguitarist was trying to point out that Tapleys claim  ""that most victims of **violent** hate crimes, 72 per cent, are men""  does not disprove the the reports claim ""that Muslim women are far more likely to be victims of hate crime""


Although it may sound like great supporting evidence, remember that it is extremely important to understand what is really being said here.  
Tapley is using information from [this out of date 2012 table](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2014001/article/14028/t/tbl05-eng.htm), what she is not considering are the notes at the bottom.


&gt;Note: Information on victims is limited to incidents involving violent offences. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


The problem with this as casualguitarist was trying to point out is that **violent** hate crimes only account for 31% of all hate crimes, and Stats can does not collect the victims gender information for non-violent hate crimes.

 
Statscan only has victim gender information for 31% of all reported hate crimes for that year, and no gender trends can be inferred that small sample that could reasonably applied to the whole, as even with in the table itself the percentages vary wildly depending on the type of crime. 


When trying to use statistics as supporting evidence for a claim, it is usually best if 70% of the information is not missing. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;



Now that we've covered why Tapleys refutation is not only based on information that is out of date but also incorrectly used. 
Let us cover why it does not disprove the Status of Women report.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;



Let us cover what this statement is **NOT** saying first.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


*It is not saying Muslim women are the majority of victims.


*It is not saying Muslims are the majority of victims.


*It is not saying women are the majority of victims.


*It is not saying religiously motivated hate crimes are the majority.


*It is not saying one gender is more likely to be a victim of a hate crime than another. (Surprising!)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;



More likely does not mean the majority  most of, or even the most. 
What the statement says is given that Muslim women represent approximately 1.6% of Canada's population and that Muslims were 10% of all hate crimes committed that year then statistically they are more likely to be victims of a hate crime compared to the general population.
Also consider that when accounting for religiously motivated hate crimes Muslims represent 32% of the victims.


Of course this statement does not dismiss that Jewish people are also more likely to be victims of hate crimes. 


Representing 1% of the population but 16% of all hate crimes.

Casualguitarist's point was correct, Tapley's attempt refute the Status of women report with that statistic does not mean anything and the report did not lie when they made the claim that ""Muslim women were more likely to be victims of hate crimes""


[Source for hate crime statistics](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/171128/t001d-eng.htm)
 


"
811,dxos4ji,"Hmm, this is not dishonesty but I think it is a result of your misunderstanding of what "" more likely"" means in this context.

What you are surmising is that because Muslim women is the subject of the statement that it's purpose it to compare it to men. (I am not sure if you intend it to mean Muslim men or men in general.)

The mistake you are making is that the statement does not actually state that the comparative here is men. 


In order to make that inference you would need a positive connection to the comparative being men. 

However remember that what falls outside of the category of Muslim women is not just men, but everything demographically that is not Muslim women.

Christian women, Jewish women, Hindi women, Christian men, Muslim men, Black men, White men, Arab men. 


These are all examples of categories that fall outside of ""Muslim women"" category.


Understanding this is an extremely important part of critical reasoning and understanding context. 


If it helps as an example in easier terms.


If I said I own a pet that is not a male dog, the logical assumption would **not** be that I own a female dog.

What is being said here is that out of the general population of Canada, Muslim women are ""far"" more likely to be victims of hate crime compared to their population representation.


1.6% of the population and potentially 10% of all hate crime victims. This means that they are up to 6 times more likely to be victims of a hate crime when compared to the general population.


Now I am not sure how I can break it down into simpler terms, but if there is a part you do not understand I am happy to help you out. 


However if you decide to keep being willfully obtuse and accusing others of dishonesty because you have a poor grasp on language, context, and argument there really is not much I can do other just advise you to chill out and re-read it a little slower and realize that perhaps the only person here that is lying to you, is you."
812,dxp9smx,"&gt;The claims do not come from the article. They come from the Immigration department.

1) Tapley's claims are from the 2012 StatsCan report while we don't know what Status of Women is citing.

&gt;(A recent Statistics Canada report focussing on 2016 has the Muslim portion of religious hate crimes higher. Although **it’s not clear what study Tapley is referring to from roughly five years ago, she may have been referring to a 2012 StatsCan report** showing three per cent of all police-reported hate crimes targeted Muslims.)

The article admits that it might be reporting on two different StatsCan reports.


**Both Tapley and ""Status of Women dept."" claims can be right at the same time and not contradict**. Mostly because it's claiming different things and possibly different time periods (we don't know this yet).


&gt;You have proof that Muslim women are more likely to be victims of hate crimes than other groups? Let's see it

Okay:

&gt;Over the period from 2010 to 2015, Muslim populations had the highest percentage of hate crime victims who were female (53%). Among Muslim women and girls, dress may heighten the visibility of religious identity, which in turn could be linked to the greater representation of women among Muslim victims. Or, this may render police more apt to classify the hate crime as anti-Muslim. With male victims who are Muslim, the hate crime could be classified by police as a crime targeting race or ethnicity rather than religion.

So there is a high validity in that **muslim women were the highest targeted among all other religious groups and higher than male counterparts of the same religion** according to the 2015 report.

Valid conclusion: Muslim women are more likely to be victims of a hate crime. 

So why isn't this in article? it should be making you think hmmm. He/she's citing 2012 stats to try and contradict possibly/probably new data but isn't consistent. 

Even if I were to calculate the likelihood of muslim women being victims of hate crime myself it would be higher than other groups.


This the most basic easy-to-understand ""error"" in that Op-ed. If you can't get this then im sorry but you're in here with extreme presuppositions even before having to read this, probably towards this Status of Women minister which has existed for 30+ years https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Status_of_Women.


So again the argument article makes is: Status of Women dept. is distorting/lieing about immigrant women by stating that muslim women are prime victims of hate crimes.

It doesn't cite ANY independent/govt provided data to support the claims even though its available for everyone. Other than quoting a quote from another official?


Here's a much better article with real numbers 
http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-closer-look-at-the-rise-in-hate-crimes-in-canada/

~Perhaps Tapley's rebuttals aren't contradicting the other report but is suggesting that violent crimes need more attention than non violent ones. Which is a fair point but it can't be used to validate what the OP-ed is asserting there.~

813,dvirn0z,"I'm white I was told in a classroom when I was eight about racism, don't hate people simply because of skin colour, dont pre judge based upon arbitrary characteristics, don't assume anything about anyone, deal with people as individuals on a case by case basis. 

This was to tackle the idea of prejudging based on stereotype and prejudice ( pre judging people ). I'm not sure other cultures or minorities got that message about white people. Raping a [kafir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafir) child isn't really rape, it would be under the law, but not islamic law.


Kafir is an insult, they are unclean, dirty, poisonous they don't count as decent respect worthy. They are not of the group. Islamic women are *modest* and cover up, I have heard the phrase ""all white women are sluts"" spoken in an office.  If a women or girl who does not display modesty and isn't islamic and is out unsupervised and a women's word is worth less than the rapist.

If it states in islam to follow the laws of the land, but they aren't your rules. Does it matter if you break them ? Do they have any moral relevance to an ideology that doesn't agree with them ?

814,dupna7d,"Some of these women are not oppressed and completely believe that hijab is the modest and correct way of dressing. It should be left to women to choose how they want to protect themselves from what they see as a treat to their womanhood. 

You can always ask, what is the next step and next law after this one. You know, let's say hijab is abolished in France but some women choose to not show any skin except for their faces. Then a new law would come to force women to show a certain percentage of body skin so they are not part of a culture that is forcing them to hide from horny men!! You get the point, right?

About the second part of your argument, there is no doubt that some Muslim women are forced by the male members of their family to wear hijab despite their true wish. But banning the hijab means now these women would be forced by their oppressors to stay home and not even leave because then they have to uncover! These women should be empowered through other means to LEAVE their oppressors. For example, if a married woman and stay-home mother of 3 kids is forced by her husband to wear hijab then she should be helped to find a job and have an income. So next time her husband says "" if you don't cover up I'll divorce you, take away the kids and throw you in the street with no money to beg"" she can say ""In fact, I am going to file for divorce and the court will give ME the custody of the kids since I have a modest income and I am the one who will throw you out of the house"".  Then you will see how fast these so called men will change and become lenient with their wives!

Finally, symbols of hate like swastika and KKK masks are banned because they are hate symbols and offensive to other people. showing your genitalia in public is also prohibited because pretty much universally it is considered  not modest to show it in public. But it is not fair to compare hijab to either of them since it is neither a symbol of hate nor  it is offensive and nonmodest. 

I stand by my original comment: women should be able to select their own outfit based on their personal beliefs and no government has the right to force them into wearing/removing their chosen outfit."

826,dmev0zq,"The hate of islam should dial down as more and more Muslims allow for reasonable critique of their quite-progressive-for-the-seventh-century texts. Reasonable critique like: gender equality might be a better way, homosexuality is not a bad thing, etc. 

These are things that will sometimes fit under the banner that you call interpretation, but to a non-Muslim it is of course obvious that your text was never meant to allow for such freedoms as openly being gay.

From its doctrines you can tell that islam wants to be a total solution for all society's ills. It has guidance for judicial, sexual, moral, spiritual, and social matters hoping to finally deliver the last word needed from the god of Abraham.

As far as religions spread by the sword goes, it succeeded in its goal of uniting the fragmented Arab tribes. It became their little slice of the Roman dream of a thousand year empire. For that Muslims even in the 21st century seem completely unable to unlink their identity and cultural self-esteem from their thinly veiled iron age religion. It is understandable but regrettable that such a regressive world view is shackling so many people.

And it is also understandable why half of Europe is completely disenchanted with the possibility of having Muslim communities grow and gain a voice. Anti-semitism and hatred of gays spread wherever Muslims gather in large numbers. Non-Muslim women are harassed for not wearing modest clothing. Regressive schools pop up and teach children to disbelieve evolution. As a culture islam has no built in Left. The US is the only country that successfully integrates Muslims, and they are extremely strict on their demands towards immigrants compared to European countries.

Lastly, I disagree with your stance that your text can and should be interpreted in a way that fits with the 21st century. I'm quite certain you need the abstract viewpoint that God really said those things to truly believe they can still be viable.

So I've seen this a lot on TD. No surprise to anyone, they are usually vehemently against Muslim people in general. But once in a while they have a different agenda, and want to signal that they aren't sexist. They'll say that they hate the way the poor Muslim women are treated and that women need more rights there. That's fine to say that women need more rights in the Middle East, it's also true. But when it comes from TD, you know it's not sincere because of their history on the subject of both Muslim people as well as women's rights. That, to me, is actual virtue signaling. "
829,dktfudg,"Muslim woman here. Seeing as this is the only comment in this entire thread that is genuinely and not just bashing/making racist jokes I thought I would reply. 

I have relatives who wear Burkas like the one pictured above despite living in western countries. It goes both ways, the men are expected to dress modestly too (what is considered a part of their modesty is different though) and lower their gaze, and the women are expected to dress modestly too. While wearing the face veil is by no means obligatory it is often adopted by lots of women as a way of becoming closer to God (the wives of the prophet also covered their faces). Before my inbox is filled with people telling me that they are forced to wear it, the vast majority are *not*. Only a very small minority are actually forced by male relatives.

In terms of wearing the hijab that is a legislated part of Islam. It's mentioned in the Quran that women should cover certain parts of their bodies by drawing their veils over themselves. It is not only a way of obeying God but of drawing closer to him. 

Please do not think that I am in any way condoning men who force their wives to cover up. Islam is by choice. While of course there will always be individuals who force others *regardless of religion* to do as they please the vast *vast* majority of women wear both the hijab and Burka by choice. Myself included (I wear the burka without the face veil).

I'm willing to answer any questions people have provided they're not the bigoted hate filled comments that have absolutely saturated this thread. If you've reached this far thanks for reading :) 

Also on slightly more relatable note, yes it's not fun at all not being to jump into beach water as easily as a man (the ""modesty"" of a woman can only be shown to male relatives that can't be married e.g. your dad, husband, sons, nephews etc. and beaches aren't exactly women only :/ ) *but* it's a sacrifice many Muslim women are willing to make seeking the pleasure of God.  Also, *yes* I am hot wearing this thanks :')

I thought that this was the only kind of ""racism"" left, instances where someone accidentally offends someone else. I didn't think that there were many people who were actually racist in the original sense of the world.

833,dlc2fjg,"This is why I hate people screaming ""We are all immigrants!"" as if the two situations are similar. First off, yes, my great great grandparents came over from Ireland to the US. I am from a family of immigrants just like most people somewhere along the line. However there is a vast difference between those immigrants and the current immigration situation. 

Immigrants like my great great grandparents came to America for opportunity. While they brought with them their culture and customs they saw America as the land of salvation. Immigrants coming to this country viewed America as an almost utopia of freedom, opportunity, and wealth. A land that could provide for them the life they dreamed of. A place that all the world should aspire to be. Some even had the belief that our roads were paved with gold. To them, America was their dream. They wanted to be Americans. To the point some even changed their names to sound more American. They were eager to become a citizen and to adopt our values. Just ask any person who immigrated to this country when they were younger. Most I have talked to say their parent's dream was to be an American and they love America. As I said, they brought their culture because it's what they know. They might have sorta self segregated themselves within communities that were mostly people from their country, but they didn't isolate themselves. They went to public schools. How many stories have you heard about kids going to public school after coming over here and they didn't speak English? While difficult, they learned. They adopted the customs and social norms of America and their region. They became a citizen.

Today with the immigration from the middle east the story is vastly different. While sweeping generalizations fall short of truth I think it's fairly safe to say that in the middle east the prevailing view of the US is mostly negative. They don't have any love or admiration for the country. They don't view it as a utopia of freedom, democracy, and wealth. Many might not dislike the US and might be pretty neutral on the topic but at least have heard ""US is bad"" more so than positive comments. They also didn't choose to leave their country. They didn't make the choice to leave their country for a better life. If they had a choice they would remain right where they lived in the middle east. Except they couldn't and were forced out. 

Problem with the new immigrants is when they come to the US they bring their culture, customs, and religion like immigrants of the past. Except instead of assimilating, adopting the new culture of the US, and the social norms of their region they instead try to recreate their home here. Look at the UK. Places dominated mostly by immigrants have turned to shit. Pub owners are harassed by muslims for serving alcohol. Non-muslim women are harassed or even assaulted for not wearing head scarfs or being out late. They are even trying to institute sharia law. They have strong armed the locals and given the climate of ""it's racist to be against immigration"" every person in power shuts the fuck up about it. To the point where it's almost forgiven. 

This is the most scary part. They refuse to become a citizen of the country that accepted them, that saved them. My biggest concern is with the potential damaging impact it could have on the US. Obviously in the US we have a democratic voting system just like many countries. What happens when a mass surge of immigrants come to the US. If they were truly trying to institute their own cultures, customs, and laws and refusing to assimilate they could be smart about it. If a large group of muslim immigrants would move/pick a place to all setup their new lives the damage could be pretty shocking. Imagine if they all made some smaller town or city their area. Like in areas of France and the UK except on a larger scale. If enough moved to that area they could elect their own politicians and out number other citizens. That politician could then introduce legislation, make ordinances, etc. that fulfill their wishes. This is the reason we needed separation of church and state. We can't allow politicians to make their decisions and introduce their legislation guided by their religion or based directly off of it. Imagine the uproar by the christianity folks who think it's fine for politicians to make laws based off of their religion when the muslim immigrant population starts to make laws based off of islam and sharia law. It's just scary. "
834,dlgd784,"Dude, it's not hard to believe that Muslim men are disproportionately assailants and that non-Muslim women are disproportionately victims. 

It is well known in South Asian communities that conservative parents often comment to their kids that white people are overly liberal in their lifestyles.  It is not hard to believe that kind of mentality does not manifest itself over time within the community.  Especially when you are also hammered in these impossible standards of purity and chastity that not only Muslim have to aspire to, but also differentiate themselves from the rest of society with.

836,dlz8o7b,"As an ex-moose, I can totally understand it. I wore the hijab for most of my younger years. I started at 8 and wore it up until 17. Obviously, initially, I wasn't interested in boys, so had no interest in 'looking hot'. As I grew older, I remained oblivious to men, and I wasn't in the 'cool' crowd, so my friends didn't care about making this effort. I was perfectly oblivious and had good self-esteem.

I experimented a bit with my appearance at 18, I was finding myself more interested in boys and found that I was getting ignored. The hijab was obviously a big 'GET LOST!' to any boy who might have otherwise shown interest. Over the next few years, I transformed into a glamorous hijabi. I developed great makeup skills (and fancy ways of tying my scarf) and saw it as a way of counter-acting the modesty of my scarf. I wasn't allowed to take off the scarf, so this was the only way I could communicate that I was attractive and still a woman. 

I hate it when people criticise Muslim women for making their makeup too glamorous because often they do so because how they do their face is the only thing they have any choice in. Also, Muslim women are told off by judgy old men for the makeup they wear, they don't need any more of that imo. "

Because it counters your point that the rules and regulations require non-Muslim women to ""wear bags on their heads"". It clearly states that Sharia dress codes are for Muslims only. It doesn't apply to non-Muslims visiting the mosque but facility rules do apply to them. It specifically says ""**masjid** rules and regulations"" which vary from mosque to mosque. It didn't say ""Islam's rules and regulations"". 

&gt;and islam is sufficiently violent in its various forms to warrant opposition.

Yet you're making this argument in a thread and article where Islam emphasizes peace, forgiveness, and understanding towards one of its mosque's attackers.

&gt;My original question wasn't intended to be insulting

You could have said hijabs or headscarves. You seem to know enough to use the right terminology but you chose the word ""bag"". We both know what your intention was.

&gt;The rules and regulations you mention include violence that detrimentally affects non muslims.

I think I know more about my faith's rules and regulations more than you. After all, I practice those rules daily. You've never met a Muslim nor have you stepped foot in a mosque to ask questions. If Sharia did preach violence then I'd be either dead or in jail. Instead, I posted an article about forgiving an act of hate against Muslims. You seem to keep missing the point of this thread.

&gt;Even if a muslim manages to not negatively impact society with their religion, they are still complicit as links in the chain that connect the muslim violence of previous generations with muslim violence of future generations. Congratulations, you've represented islam very well.

And the polygamy stuff is absolute bullshit.

If Islam allowed it such, it wouldn't need after 1300years social acceptance.  
Your claims of the rape of Arab women are completely unfounded, A Muslim man abusing a none family women is bound to their house for life- that's sharia law.  
And gays are treated equally bad by all religions especially some American Christian ones who rally on a regular basis saying they should die. And that unmarried Mother's should be stoned.   
And the majority of these rapes that you speak of, have when investigated, not been done by immigrants.
  
There are many many places in Sharia law where Muslim women are not in anyway treated fairly, but the fact that you didn't state one of these is unequivocal proof of your complete lack of knowledge on the issue.

&gt;More frequently, Obama’s presidency was marked by effigies of our first black president hanging from nooses across the country, for example in Kentucky, Washington State, and Maine, or being burned around the world. What Trump supporters fail to remember is that following Obama’s election, property was destroyed across the country, for example in Pennsylvania, Texas, and North Carolina, and a predominately black church was torched in Massachusetts.

&gt;In 2008, anti-Obama protesters lashed out against minorities because of their discontentment with a black man being voted into the office of president for the first time in our nation’s history. Conversely, in 2016, anti-Trump protesters are holding mostly peaceful demonstrations because of their discontentment with a man, who has ostracized minorities, being voted into the office of president.

&gt;And while anti-Trump protesters have engaged in mostly peaceful demonstrations against the president-elect, pro-Trump supporters have been responsible for a wave of attacks against Muslims, Latinos, blacks, and the LGBT community.

&gt;According to Mark Potok, senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center civil rights group, there haven’t been “such a rash of hate crimes in the United States since Barack Obama was elected America’s first black president in 2008.” Muslim women are reporting having their hijabs ripped from their heads, while immigrant children are being bullied. Trump’s name and slogan, “Make America Great Again,” are being found alongside swastikas and anti-minority messages in graffiti around the nation.

&gt;Ultimately, demonstrators are not protesting Trump because he is Republican. They aren’t protesting him because he is a white male. These protests are because of the bigotry his campaign has emboldened and the fear of discrimination his presidency has the capacity to perpetuate. "
846,dh5vgfu,"I probably hate that more than SJWs. Yes, males have issues and it's important to discuss (which legitimate feminist circles do), yes the current huge uptick in white rural cities being on meth and heroin needs to be helped, yes, Muslim women and gay men in third world countries are sometimes treated badly but for the most part when people bring them up, they just wanna derail the conversation and make it about them.
""Why don't you care that Muslim women are being stoned in Iraq or gay men are thrown off roofs in Afghanistan or that white teens are dying from meth or that straight males get raped too?!""
They do care. They've posted about it in other articles or tweets, they've donated money, they've done advocate work, it just wasn't being mentioned on this particular post. And 10/10 times people that comment shit like that never have ANY other comments or insights about the issue they brought up except to try to take over the conversation. They'll scream that American feminists don't care about Muslim women in third world countries being raped because someone tweeted about the wage gap, but then the very next tweet they'll say that 50% of all rapes are made up allegations and how if women didn't want to be harassed they shouldn't wear short skirts to a bar."
847,dhdjytb,"&gt; Is there systemic racism in the US ?

Yes. 

&gt; Is there systemic sexism in the US ?

Yes.

&gt; Can whites be victims of racism ?

Yes.

&gt; Are cops racist ?

Not all cops are racist, but there are certainly racist cops.

&gt; Is affirmative action good ?

It has its time and place, but it's not a panacea. 

And sure, I'll go through your responses: 

&gt; Muslim women are objectified and are not as free as muslim men. That's a fact. Facts are not racist.

Um, not all Muslim women are objectified in this way, but yes, it's common. ""She probably, maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say. You tell me."" is clearly baiting and criticizing their religion, race and culture, when it had literally NOTHING to do with the conversation. This is the same as commenting any other race with any other stereotype out of nowhere. 

&gt; It's not racist to have doubts regarding the genuineness of a judge.

You are correct. But that's not what he's doing. He's commenting directly on his race and saying *that* is the cause of ruling, regardless of the fact that he was born in Indiana and is just as much an American citizen as Trump is. Trump is projecting onto him that because he is a certain race, he has certain opinions. Which is racism. 

&gt; Counter suit emitted and then shot down perhaps unfairly. Lawsuits settled instantly. No admission of guilt. Therefore not grounds to call him racist.

[Not quite](http://www.snopes.com/donald-trump-racist-meme/): ""In 1992, Trump lost an appeal to overturn a $200,000 penalty for removing black dealers from the tables at the request of high rollers, and in 1996, 20 African-Americans in Indiana sued Donald Trump, accusing him of reneging on a promise that he would hire largely minorities as his riverboat casino staff.""

And this is far from the only case. 

&gt; Your first link is to a massive story I don't have time to read, be more specific. 

Maybe this is why we have different understandings of the situation.

&gt;And you might want to check with your supervisor, the second link of your copy pasted list is inaccessible

I don't know what this means, but the link is dead. The same passage is found in that Snopes article I listed as an alternative, though: “And isn’t it funny. I’ve got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. . . . I think the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.”

&gt; Actually, nazis hate Trump. You only have to look at 4chan for that, they criticize him for having jewish family and having said that he would like jewish grandchildren, as well as supporting Israel. So you lied about that one.

Um, [no I didn't](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/clinton-ad-kkk-trump-227404)? Of course some hate him because his son in law is a (((globalist))). If your primary defense here is *well, not ALL white supremacists love him!*, I don't think there's much to say. 

&gt; I've adressed that in the comments in this thread.

I don't see how this is a refutation at all. It looks like plenty of others also pointed that out to you. But let's pretend that Trump being the leader of birtherism isn't racist... The rest of your argument in support of his birtherism is hard to swallow, and I responded there accordingly. "
848,di2svg3,"Haha if you don't think there are at least 6 million Muslims in Germany you are deluding yourself.

But since you're good with the government numbers, how many German women are raped by Muslim per year and how many Muslim women are raped by German men per year? Does your government allow that information to even be released?

Since according to you Muslims are such a tiny percentage of your population, there should be far more rapes of Muslim women then the opposite (since there are far more German men). 

Can you get those numbers? Do you even care for the German women raped? Is it hate speech to ask this question? 

Go down to the public pool with your sister this summer in little turkey, Westphalia see what happens. 

But those victims don't matter. They're just casualties in your quest for multiculturalism "

850,fot5t00,"College isn't the only method to success,  you can learn to code for free on odinproject and a few other platforms. There are many free certifications you can earn that can earn you a 6 figure income. So no you aren't a farmer who's stuck farming, you are only in your own mind. Don't have a quitters mentality. Plus, the job you have now likely allows for advancement within your lifetime, unlike people back then.

No i didn't, that was Standford i believe, they all do that, all the ivy leagues. The rich can literally afford to take short cuts. I never said it was fair.

My point is, wealth is in the same things, but today our world is expensive (this is no excuse) but we have the potential to earn a lot more. We're lucky in the modern world. My original point was that marriage shouldn't be expensive as a result of false expectations.

you can still go to college. Sign up for classes part time online while you work, you can even get a bachelors in engineering perhaps even do a masters. There's many online programs today that are cheap. Cheapest online software engineering masters is less than 7k. And its earned under 2 years, offered by Georgia tech.

We don't live in that world, we live in a better world where you can have the best of both worlds. You can still build wealth, more wealth than that old world. And plenty of Muslim women are OK with polygamy, so long as you make enough, just like it was in the old days.

Maybe that's what your missing? Polygamy was usually practiced by the richest of the Arabs. Poor people obviously couldn't afford to take care of 4 wives."
851,fmciazn,"Buddy just judging from your username and what you have described, I am sensing that some sort of a middle-eastern dynamic is going on here. I am not stereotyping because I myself belong to this culture and had to go through something similar.  


While the world thinks that Muslim women are oppressed, and Muslim men nothing short of Khal Drogo from GoT, but the fact is that at least, upper middle class middle-eastern women are way too pampered.  


First of all their fathers have pampered them all their live and have never had a real taste of responsibility. And after marriage they hop between ""I am a strong independent women"" and ""Providing for me is your responsibility as a Man"" depending on their convenience. 

However, marriage no matter how rich you are, is the name of an equal partnership between two adults. So my friend, you wife is immature.   


Give her money, gifts whatever you easily can. It will avoid unnecessary tension in the house.  She will call you cheap, she will use every trick in the book to manipulate you to get the life style she wants. She is not acting an adult.

Whether you give 20%, 30% or just have shared finances where both of you could splurge responsibly is your individual balance. I am sure she will find a way to criticize even if you were giving her 100%.

My advise, give her responsibility. May be tell to get a job if she really wants something.

And also try to gradually lower her expectations, if she picks up something designer dont just buy her thinking that she would be appreciative. It will just set a new normal, so downgrade to a new normal that you are comfortable with."
852,fhnf4oc,"&gt; You started with ""...reality confirms the proven damages. I wanted to know how you could justify harm regardless of that...."" Now you're at ""as with most reported cases"".

yes reality confirms it because that’s what happens in the majority of cases only rarely does it not affect the victim as drastically, it’s still abuse &amp; manipulation. 

again if someone abused you and you were “fine”with it that doesn’t make it not abuse anymore
why do I have to repeat basic concepts  is your skull that thick? 


&gt; Jokers like you are so in love with leveling the charge of pedophilia, but I keep asking you all: Is it the pattern of behavior that a ""pedophile"" has a girl available to him at 6 years old, but waits until she becomes pubescent before having intercourse with her? Is that the MO of a pedophile? Tell us, since you seem to be a very knowledgeable guy (lol) in terms of reality: What does statistics tell you about that?

so you’re genuinely retarded? 
where did I say he was a pedophile since that’s all you keep whining about? 

 I said YOU were a pedophile apologist because you think they’re free to rape girls as young as9 if it’s “marriage”. 

he may not have been a pedophile but he certainly was a child rapist. 
you’re trying so hard to make it sound better it’s pathetic 
which makes you a child rape apologist 

&gt; In fact, you probably won't tell us how ridiculous your claim of pedophile is in face of the reality that the Prophet, 

show the claim that doesn’t change the fact it was rape 

&gt; , waited for the girl to become a woman, at puberty, 

and THAT is one of the many reasons  muslims are generally a danger to civilisation, keep them away from elementary schools and your kids because you can’t be sure if they’d go “hMm I wonder if that 3rd grade girl had her period or not so I can think of her sexually” 

&gt; but you'll just go on repeating your nonsense. 

What do I keep repeating that is false,  deluded clown

&gt; Since you're gonna provide us with ""SCIENTIFIC"" research data, what does science tell us is the difference between a girl and a woman? What's the key defining factor? lol. Please leave Waffle House before you answer. LOL.

Woah you actually need a proof of why children for example those under 12 aren’t adults? 
unlike what your rapist role model taught, science (something you aren’t interested in when it comes to this) says humans aren’t psychologically, physically and mentally ready at these ages 
even if a girl _starts_ sexual maturation she’d  still be under DEVELOPMENT  

I can’t believe I have to bring that up  twice  

&gt; prove to us, PRETTY PLEASE, that there was a ""victim"", that someone was ""manipulated"", and that there was ""abuse"" in the case of the marriage of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and 'Aisha

oh you want me to explain again (to someone  that could see my niece who’s only 8 as a potential wife for an old man) why that’s wrong and why she’s still a child that’s not done developing enough to be capable of it or even comprehending it just like all the other “adult tasks”? 

&gt; That a nice little twist: 'or else they'd be sinners'. You couldn't stop at ""forced"", because you'd have to admit that Muslim women are not ""forced"" to wear the hijaab. So, slick, you add your little spin. lol. Nice!

it’s mandatory 
obviously if someone doesn’t keep a mandatory teaching they wouldn’t be literally forced but they’d be sinners and could go to hell for it (like leaving prayer)

 and a large number  does get literally forced by their societies and families.

&gt; It's the kind of comparison that decent people understand. But, magicians and spin doctors don't. Sorry for you.

you mean the kind that braindead people  understand.
repeat until it gets through your skull

muslim women who don’t always wear the hijab are sinners. 
it’s not mandatory in christianity, nuns choose living and dressing the way they do 

&gt; and accusing others of what they didn't say or do.

rich coming from you 

 trying to cover up your approval of child rape because the child magically transforms into an adult once they start physical maturation and if they don’t they’re still children even if they’re teens 

very scientific such a good argument 🤡👏👏

you shouldn’t reproduce 




anyway the conclusion in short is 

 you condone pedophilic behaviour 
 

I’m done replying to someone who defends that because they’re worthless garbage, I was bored and expected something that actually made a litttle sense but of course not 

not surprising considering your religion thoguh"
853,f6arjza,"&gt;To answer your question, yes, Muslim women are human who commit sin. Why? Who knows. Maybe they struggle with their deen due to trauma. Maybe they don’t feel the need to wear it just yet. Maybe they know they should but can’t bring themselves to do it. Maybe they never plan on wearing it. Maybe they can only wear the hijab and not conceal their figure but they know it’s better than not wearing the hijab at all

No indication for Hijab, eh? Please stop with the dishonesty.

Zina of the eyes also refers to posting revealing pictures online for the whole world to see and thus commit Zina of the eyes. More evidence: https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27259/ruling-on-the-things-that-lead-to-zina-kissing-touching-and-being-alone-together

Telling me to speak with knowledge when you're ignorant on the concepts of Zina of the eyes, how serious of an obligation the Hijab is? That's rich. Do you have any formal Islamic education to be telling others who actually do have an Islamic education to speak with knowledge?

No, you accused me of being a ""hypocrite"" and claimed that I must be following women and gymboys. I want to clarify that I'm not and am willing to give you my Instagram handle to prove it. If you're going to make these accusations, at least get all of the evidence first instead of slandering me. It honestly says a lot about you that you'd somehow assume that because I'm coming at things from a religious angle and not the ""secular"", ""liberal"" angle which loves sinning openly and taking pride in their sin, I must be some sort of ""hypocrite""? I grew up like this, I was that kid in school who got made fun of my other Muslims for praying and avoiding sins. I was that kid who spent his time after school in the masjid memorizing Quran. I was that kid who didn't go to a single party, date a single girl, or touch a drop of alcohol. I was that kid who didn't have a cellphone until he graduated high school. All I can say for this is Alhumdulliah. And then for you to come along and say what you said? That's messed up."
854,ejmfxxm,"Islam is a beautiful religion with many rich ideas/concepts. I had some misconceptions before learning more about it as well, but I think a lot of these boil down to how different people interpret it, as with most religions based on old texts. The Quran has some beautiful Surahs and verses, and it's history is very interesting. In modern times a lot of muslim women are arguing that many passages written about women are misunderstood due to being interpreted by men. Hope this helps!"
855,ecg266m,"Hey I was raised muslim as well. I don't believe in anything now that I'm older and have dug deeper into religion. Muslim women are even worse than normal western girls.

 Really, they are pretty much all the same(AWALT), but in the sense that you have to remember they have a greater standard good girl image they have to maintain. So the level of hypocrisy is millions of times greater. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most western women don't have to pretend to be virgins and for the most part don't get arranged marriages. But many muslim girls either get a straight up arranged marriage. Or best case they may get options to pick any muslim guy.  The problem is most of them are not actually attracted to muslim guys (usually not alpha in the west especially)So what they will do is get married for the image while continuing to fuck chads and Tyrones behind their husbands back. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I  was in my first year of college there was a Hijabi girl who's dad was an imam. She routinely led dudes on, but I started noticing her coming to play basketball at the school gym more and more. Back then, being more involved in my religious community, I decided to talk to her so she'd feel more comfortable because I figured it was probably stressful  playing basketball as a hijabi with a bunch of dudes watching. After getting to know her more and even temporarily becoming her friend I find out she's engaged to a rich lebanese dude and is getting married soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

By the end of the month, I kid you not she was fucking all the Tyrones on the basketball court. I was friends with many of them and they all showed me her messages. At the time, I was still fairly blue pilled, so I decided to tell all her muslim girlfriends assuming they would be disgusted by her behaviour as well. As you may already know, they all defended her until I thought maybe I was the crazy person. (they were all hoejabis as well.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Females will always defend against men finding out their true nature. I truly believe it is their biggest fear. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR AWALT"
856,e8lw5xt,"&gt;Progress is definitely there on all sides. If you ignore the number of our poor ppl, you'll see rich ppl are getting rich. All time high consumerism. But random stuff is getting banned. Petrol on the steep rise and so is religious extremism. Y'all don't have to deal with communal politics right? Everyone's on one happy side. It's getting uglier here each day. I mean why go through the trouble of partition if they're all still going to twist and manipulate everyone into fighting like a big joint family squabble. But they're all still happy cause we have McDonald's in so many corners. u/Kaashwi

There is death penalty for blasphemy and apostasy in Pakistan. Christian and Hindu people are persecuted to no end. Even Muslim women are divorced off easily and have to live with polygamy only for men. "
857,dwcy9tp,"&gt; Better arguments please? There is an enormous inequality between the poor and the rich too. 

As per the constitution - the State cannot discriminate against a citizen on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.
If the state is allowing a man to have more than one spouse &amp; is not allowing a woman to do the same, then it's a violation of fundamental rights.

&gt; Ridiculous how?

Ridiculous because most Muslim women are not in a position to renounce Islam like you suggested. Not just that, some mullah may even put a fatwa on them for doing so. Many mullahs believe that renouncing Islam is punishable by execution.  

&gt; What inequality? You'll be taking away the freedom of following religion by consenting adults you know.

Freedom to practice a religion doesn't trump fundamental rights. 

&gt;  It just has to ensure that basic human rights are not getting violated then it can bypass religion

But it does.  

&gt; Do you disagree with the secularism and that government should on its own whims and fee-fees should interfere in some places and not in others?

Govt is not doing this on their own whims. They are asking the SC court to check if this is unconstitutional or not.   

 




&gt; More taxation, profits to be distributed to the labour, and grabbing the lands of the bourgeois then?

"
858,dwddjup,"Great question.  First as a believing Muslim, I don't see my religion as a myth obviously but I think I understand what you're asking.  I'll start by giving you some stats on Muslim American women and their faith: You can learn more here: www.ispu.org/poll:
-Muslim women are among the most educated women in America and more educated than Muslim men.
-Muslim women report experiencing more religious discrimination than men.
-Nearly half of Muslim women say as a result of the 2016 election they feel personally worried for their own safety or that of their family from white supremacist groups. 
Yet despite these challenges and even costs to being who they are:
-Muslim women are religious: More than 90% say their religion is important to their daily lives.  This is slightly higher than Muslim men.
So something is obviously working for them in Islam to hold on to it with all the potential social costs.  I will only speak for myself when I explain what Islam give me that a philosophy without God cannot.  For me the core concept that animates everything in Islam is the Oneness of God.  This idea of pure monotheism is often narrowly understood as just not worshipping idols, but it is much more than that.  It means that nothing is worthy of worship except God, not money, ambition, greed, ego, patriarchy or men's approval.  Just God is our goal, our point of reference, our source of affirmation.  It liberates humanity from slavery one to another, women to men, weak to strong, poor to rich, and makes us equal before our Creator.  I am taught in the Quran that God created both men and women as His deputies on Earth, not a deputy and his helper, but that we are both given the heavy honor and responsibility of free will.  "
859,dvtdigf,"&gt; The first one is race.

No, religion, and the various cultures born of that religion. 



This religion defines the role of women, and the interaction between Muslims and non-believers. These are the words of God via his prophet, and the hadiths. Islam is deeply patriarchal and misogynist at its very core. Also remember Islam is not just a complete religious, political and legal system, it also defines how to live your day to day life and how you interact with others.

The role of women as property/chattels and breeders first defines how Muslim men see women, and how Muslim women have numerous protections. This is a common theme in Abrahamic religions. However it differs because the role of non-believers is also defined insofar as these protections are do not apply to them and Islam very much has the Muslim/Kafir barrier. This is adopted by society, and becomes the culture. These are not just religious rules, but societal values. This means that where this impacted most, it didn't always mean the men are devout. 

The more devout the community, the more the separation between Muslims and kafir the more pronounced the interactions between Muslim men and kafir women. I say kafir women because in Telford this includes Sikh girls. I know that in other areas in the Midlands and North the Muslim men first targeted Sikh girls too, but the Sikhs fought back and sectarian tensions exist to this day.

This is most pronounced in working class Muslim communities. In general the more wealthy and educated, the more secular, the more inclusive and Westernised the person, but I know mega-rich Muslims with actual harems of ""property"", and diverse and inclusive working class Muslims. In some countries,even the protections afforded to Muslim women are broken, Egypt is not a nice place for even Muslim women to travel alone.

What I have found, and what I have experienced is that among the more devout/less educated/less secular/poorer/working class communities, the above combination has produced a culture where kafir females are scorned, seen as sluts, as whores, as worthless. I have had this conversation with younger Muslim males on numerous occasions when I worked in a processing centre with lots of lads from Tower Hamlets. I have seen this conversation many times on my socmedia. This is further strengthened as mentioned in the above second point, where the kafir demonstrate they (police and authorities) believe the women and girls are worthless sluts and 
whores too. From this you end up with the groups of males treating the kafir women as they do.

Not even all Muslim cultures have similar approaches to women. 

I have a friend who studies this and he points out the matriarchal and Buddhist roots of SE Asian Muslims has meant that Islam evolved differently (no SE Asians arrested), but Arab imperialisation and globalisation is in full flow so we are starting to treat our women like the Arabs and other Muslim cultures do. The cases we've seen so far are based around the communities, hence lots of North Asian Muslims (Rotherham etc) and some Arabs and Persians. (Oxford iirc)

Trevor Phillips was spot on when he stated that whilst multiculturalism worked so well with other minorities, the failing of multiculturalism and Islam was that it allowed the Muslim/Kafir barrier to grow uncontrolled in closed communities with societal values that do not allow them to interact with non-believers in a manner that society requires.

The longer term solution can only be integration. No more faith schools, no more allowing of religion in education, bussing kids to non-Muslim areas for school, no more brainwashing children to believe the patriarchy and misogyny is right. They'll just have to head back to the days before multiculturalism, integrate and drag British Islam screaming and kicking into the 21st century and weather the storm of Islamophobia accusations. I'm not saying Islamophobia doesnt exist, look at the entire network around Tommy Robinson et al, but I know its used in situations where it shouldn't be, and destroying the patriarchy and rape culture should be one of those.

**Indias slave brides: Commission for Minorities wants entry of sheikhs to be monitored** 

 ______ 
The National Commission for Minorities (NCM) has urged the Narendra Modi government to strictly monitor entry of sheikhs in the country after Hyderabad police this week busted a racket that sold off minor girls to men from Arab nations on the pretext of marriage. Observers say it has been an open secret for long that a nexus of brokers and qazis has been running such a ring where girls are trafficked from perhaps all parts of the country. Now, the NCM has requested the ministry of external affairs to scrutinise the entry of sheikhs, especially those over 50 years of age.

Thousands of India's slave brides are often destined for a lifetime of abuse and hardship in the Gulf nations. Girls from poor families are sold like commodities to the Arabs, many of whom arrive in India on tourist visas. In a letter to minister Sushma Swaraj, NCM chairperson Syed Ghayorul Hasan Rizvi has asked that ""the ministry for external affairs may instruct all the Indian missions in the middle-eastern countries to strictly verify and scrutinise the background of these sheikhs, especially aged 50 or above, before issuing visa to them."" The letter added that the issue needs to be dealt with strictly as it is bringing ""disrepute to the country"".

In another letter to the union home ministry, Rizvi urged the Centre to prepare a comprehensive list of such incidents and crimes so that a realistic assessment of the problem is available, claiming it is widespread.

""The National Commission of Minorities is of the view that ministry of home affairs must issue instructions to all the concerned agencies of the states and the union territories to sternly deal with the nexus of brokers, qazis, hotel owners and sheikhs and arrest them for outraging the modesty of innocent Muslim girls on the pretext of 'nikah',"" it said.

HOW POOR MUSLIM WOMEN ARE LURED

The letters by Rizvi made observations about the dismal plight of these trafficked girls who are often pushed into prostitution as they are deserted by the sheikhs after reaching abroad. ""It is a fact that Muslim women from poor families are lured by agents for contract marriage with sheikhs coming from Oman, Qatar and other middle- eastern countries Upon reaching there, these girls are deserted by sheikhs and are tortured, sold and forced into prostitution by them. Many of these girls are forced to work as servants by these sheikhs as they are already married ,"" Rizvi wrote.

The NCM moved the two ministries as it received a complaint from advocate Mehmood Pracha of Nizamuddin West in Delhi. This Wednesday, Hyderabad Police busted a major racket of contract marriages of young Muslim girls by sheikhs and arrested 20 people including five Omani nationals, three from Qatar and three qazis. Apart from them, their local contacts were also arrested, including five brokers and four lodge owners.

The police said that the information was leaked when they got a tip-off from a minor girl who had earlier been interviewed by one of the sheikhs for the purpose of marriage. Cops blew the lid off the well-oiled machinery of the ring as the local brokers would indulge the sheikhs right from the time they landed at the airport, providing them accommodation and information about potential girls from economically poor background. The brokers would then convince the families to marry their girls to the rich sheikhs, luring them with promises of a bright and happy future for the girls. The girls were also interviewed.

861,dgz1zbh,"For one, I'd use the UN Declaration of Human Rights (+ rights of the child) as the basis moreso than sovereignty, which is a false right, as Saudi so aptly demonstrates. Every Saudi has the right to be executed for speaking out against a birthright monarchy? That's utterly ridiculous.

Secondly, ""a moral argument against forcing my values on people who don't share them"" is exactly the point here. This doesn't have a maximum radius, nor automatically falter at any line drawn on a map, but is the basis for living in a decent society. A woman who has her own values should not be physically harmed for choosing to be dressed in a manner in which she enjoys and believes is decent (doubly so as many Muslim women are not hijabi).

Your argument leaves many people in a worse state than the state of nature. At least as beasts, there is some chance that one might be agile enough, smart enough, strong enough, to avoid predation, and, up until the point at which they could no longer do so, they would be free. But by enforcing a might makes right system (of which sovereignty without any preconditions absolutely is), it allows those in power to amorally and/or maliciously harm with exponentially greater efficiency.

If you want to make the argument we cannot meaningfully change the situation in the short term, I might even agree. But conflating polluting foreign countries to maximize profits for the rich with women having basic dignity and freedom is not a great comparison.

Also, you give the Saudi royalty far too much credit. Many of them aren't naive, god-fearing peasants, but OTOH, they care very little for others and aren't genuinely progressive. If the Saudi king could do anything he wanted, without the slightest fear of reprisal or even rebuke, Saudi would still not be awesome."
862,fovs62e,"&gt;Are you really, tho? Black chicks look like apes (I had a fetish for em but I digress), arab girls are ugly, mexican girls can be decent but most of them are trash... White girls are just the most attractive out of em all. 

I mean honey boo boo's mother is 10/0 because of her superior genes right? Also ugliness is a trait that is one present in all groups of people, and two is mainly in the eyes of the beholder. Who says an Asian woman who may be considered hideous in China is not attractive to me or others who do not live in China? 

&gt;This is pretty much universally agreed. 

Honey boo boo's mother is 10/10, this is indeed universally agreed. 

&gt;This is pretty much universally agreed. AND, there's no way you're having so much sex that the same race gets boring. And if you are, you need to reconsider the value of sex and/or stop watching porn. Many people think it's just a casual game, something to do for fun... Something you can do without being intimate with the person. That's not the right way to look at it. You have to have principles and our principles state that it's something more special than that. It also is not good for your brain's reward system as I mentioned. It draws focus away from things that you *should* be focusing on.

If you don't restrict yourself on basis of race for sex aye you can have alot of it. Also intimacy is great, but it is fleeting. Your telling me I'm going to only be happy with a single woman for 50+ years? Those principles I don't agree with.

&gt;Please do me a solid and look up on google ""&lt;any European country&gt; fertility rate"" and then do the same for ""&lt;any African country&gt; fertility rate"". In countries like Niger it's 7 births per woman (healthy ones, too). Somalia 6, and even in the middle east it is 4 in a lot.

Sounds like its Europeans fault for not having a lot of kids. Wouldn't the correct response for those europeans who complain that society is looking more like those who are doing all the work of having kids to I dunno.......have more kids? Just bring the european fertility rate to say 8 and problem solved. 

&gt;Simply put, the stats say whites will be extinct very soon if nothing is done.

Considering that the stats are self imposed, and the work that is needed to raise them is just more sex without contraception, I think that its not a genocide, just people being lazy. If your too lazy to have kids then why should others care that less people look like you? Mother nature certainly will be laughing at you if you complain about it.

&gt;Having copious amounts of meaningless sex is not good for you, either. Your principles are dogshit, ""enjoy life"" ""do good"" wtf? I can just as easily lump my principles into those four words but that's a crock. What really are your principles? You've sat down and thought about it? What kind of man do you want to be remembered by?

I suppose I wanna get humanity into the space age, since I'm a major Sci-Fi fan and our human civilization has all the tools to become like The Expanse in the next hundred years, and Star Trek in say 200-1000. Is this a better principle?"
863,fquh81n,"&gt;In my case, people blamed me bc I didn’t feel a connection with any of the guys that I would meet. Plenty of men, great guys, cant say anything is wrong with them. But it’s my fault bc I should give men a chance who I just don’t have a connection with. 

That’s what I’m arguing against in my first comment. I don’t want people to marry to fulfill a society cost but to do so when they find people they are interested in.  If NO ONE finds them interesting then something is off and the other gender shouldn’t be blamed. If a guy came up to me and said not a single Muslim girl was into him and he seemed like a great candidate I would assume it was a PR issue. Not that Muslim women are being lazy or committing Zina. 

&gt;I have a bmw too lol but I don’t think material items impact how a persons character, morals, values are.

Imagine if a dude wanted to talk to you and all he had was a bmw. You’d be like “this isn’t what others meant about working on yourself”. The issue is the amount of conversations I’ve had on here about people who “working on themselves” but not getting hair cuts, changing their fit, working out at the gum consistently, working on their speech (maybe it’s harsh and that’s driving people away) is kinda crazy high. Being a doctor isn’t a personality trait. Being kinda and gentle is. Being an engineer means nothing if your snarky. It’s hard to get people to stop looking at “working on yourself” and thinking of the money in the bank as if that’s what the opposite sex truly wants."
864,ev3yc6p,"ok then you wanna talk about fuckin sexism ? fine coz it goes both ways, why do women who falsely accuse men of rape get out with it so lightly while men get their life destroyed while men who got raped don't get taken seriously ? ""oh it doesn't happen often, it's not the same"" RAPE IS RAPE NO MATTER WHO, 

then maybe i'll tell you a true story: in highschool a girl started making fun of me because my mom worked at my highschool and that i was basically privileged and was using very crude language, my response? a simple: ""fuck off"" ... i got beaten up by a bunch of older dudes that day because i was a boy and i wasn't supposed to talk to girls that way, why is it ok ?

oh wait i got a better idea: when you get hit by a women in the street you better not try to even defend yourself coz you're sure as fuck gonna get sued over it/gonna get judged by anybody else because you don't have the right to ""morally speaking"" the world is sexist, what you're doing isn't contributing to a better world, you're just fueling your self satisfaction and that's it, the world is sexist, but not only against women it's time you learn that and stop complaining when it probably doesn't even invole you (i'm assuming you're a male since women surfing reddit probably have more brains than to just get offended by a meme USING FUCKIN WEEB ANIME CHARACTERS) you're just trying to look good on the internet, sad thing really, 'cause at the end of the day the people you're trying to appeal towards probably probably won't notice you and the only ones who remember you are the ones you pissed off. 

if you wanna nitpick about sexism ? fine, but do it when the actual world is rid of it not on the internet where 99% of sexism is immediately shot down when need be

you wanna know what actual sexism is ? young arab girls are sold or ""forced"" into aranged marriages with people that could be twice their age since their young (even before they hit fuckin puberty) did you contribute toward abolishing that ? no you didn't you're too lazy to do that. girls fuckin get raped out in the streets and some people find it in their hearts to say ""she shouldn't have gone out with those clothes if she didn't really want to"" in some countries girls who get raped are forced to marry the one who raped them (as it wasn't traumatic enough already) Did your anti-sexism on the internet and keyboard warriorism contribute against this ? no. 

do you even  have anybody you know who suffered from sexism ? and when i say suffered i don't mean ""they got offended by a joke"", probably not, if yes then try to help them instead of doing what you're doing now"
865,ehbfemu,"But when you realize that some people have a choice it looks less and less like that.

866,duvzqjv,"Along with what u/s86ahmed said, you should try matrimonial sites, which are different from dating sites. You want to utilize every avenue possible. Don't fall into the thinking that it's not romantic and it's only for people who are failing in finding a spouse in every other way. You want to be smart. I think everyone that starts looking to get married should also start using these sites. Now I know a lot of people seem to complain about the low success rate but I can't help but find that insane. Like seriously, real Muslim men are on the site looking for marriage. Real Muslim women are on these sites looking for marriage. It's a no brainer. I don't understand how marriages are not happening left and right. My hypotheses is a) mabey a lot of people that need to work on themselves, that are not marriage material, and shouldn't be seeking to get married until they're ready to be a proper husband/wife are looking to get married, b) people are so freaking lazy (goes back to a ) and are either not trying or don't know a thing about selling themselves online,  and c) the effect of seeing so many options is making people way too picky about superficial things, or maybe people's standards are just too high in general across the board. I don't have the right background for people to listen to me but these are just my thoughts. 

I've seen people recommend HalfOurDeen and PureMatrimony. The key is putting in a lot of effort into your profile (seriously, get a good photographer and take really good pics. It's going to be the 2nd most important profile in your life, after your favorite social media profile) and knowing your standards ahead of time. 

Disclaimer: I'm 18 and have never used a matrimonial site. Again I hope I don't sound like a privileged person who doesn't know what they're talking about. I've been reading these posts for the past few months (except the most recent month) and I'm engaged so I feel like my advice can be helpful. "
867,dtt5yux,"Muslim here, can confirm what are you saying. However, there are of course some exceptions. Muslim women are now exposed to feminism just as your average Western country, just more subtle. 

Burqa is not a requirement, just those Arabs are the ones promoting it for, you know, more Arab = more Islam. However in this part of Asia (SE Asia), women have to just wear a simple hijab (which they obviously not because those Arab ideas are pouring out to us, so the women here want the expensive and elaborate burqas and hijabs handmade from Mecca, because why not). And polygamy is allowed in Islam, technically. Practically (based on my location), it is never possible. Your family is against it, the wives' family are against it (nevermind the wife is either a lazy SAHM or a career woman who forgot their responsibility to their husband), it's just impossible to marry more than one wife. 

And not to mention that Islam actually wants women to stay at home, which obviously seems like they are doing work, which again, obviously don't. Because they have their husband's money for maids, and themselves are a lazy bum, they really want to be treated like a princess just sitting her bum in a $999,999,999 mansion while ""appreciates"" the husband's work. 

Some woman of course, want to marry because, ""Well, that's what Mohammed want, to marry a pious man and breed angelic children"". Yeah, no. Why the fuck you girls choose those young Arab imams (who ""incidentally"" have some of the Arab oil wealth) instead of those local village imams? Why do they present imams as those handsome-looking tall and holding-frame-just-for-Allah man in the dramas? In reality, they are liars. 

Those Muslim women use Islam as their facade to filter out undesirable man. That's all.

868,duh8bds,"I think one problem the US will have with universal health is that the government doesn't own the hospitals, last time I checked there were only a few dozen and most of those were Veterans hospitals.

If the government has the pay the private rate to the hospitals for all citizens it will bankrupt it over night, Here in Australia the government owns most of the hospitals and as you say, every damn emergency ward is full of kids with sniffles that a free doctors appointment could fix.

From personal experience and talking to nurses just last week when my son was in hospital, a lot of Muslim women are not allowed to take kids to the doctors during the day so they wait till hubby is home and just go to the emergency ward in the evening.

With just 24 million people 50% of Australia's budget goes to health and social security so it is a huge expense and limits what we can spend on other things.  Thankfully America is an ally so we can use your military if we get invaded, ours sucks because we spend all our money on health and money for those too lazy to work :)  "

That it is bigoted (or ""lazy stereotyping"") in some way to acknowledge these trends?

Are the vast majority of Muslims rapists? Of course not. The vast majority of Muslims are just normal people who want to go about their daily lives.


However, there is a small yet not-insignificant number of Muslims who have very fundamentalist conservative beliefs that are not compatible with Western values. The view that non-Muslim women are ""whores"" and not considered to be ""real women"" is one of them, and the fact that so many are so eager to call anyone who points this out a racist is part of the reason these ""grooming gangs"" are getting away with what they're doing."
875,fp5w9b2,"Islam is founded by Muhammad - a confirmed rapist and pedophile and librandus do not have a problem with it. 

A minor muslim girl who has reached puberty(~ 13 years) can  marry(ie also be married) in India and it's legal according to muslim personal law. Gujarat HC and Delhi HC have given rulings in cases. So, it's the librandus who are responsible for this.

Librandus just go missing when non-muslim women are raped by Muslims. There is no outrage.

Look at this example: https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/27-yr-old-rapes-woman-he-met-on-dating-app-records-the-act/story-E5CtGB68krTNTcwBD60iSK.html

I bet you don't even know about this incident - Librandu newspaper gives all the clues but does not have the balls to name the religion of the culprit(Islam) who raped a Hindu woman(starting from Eid) for two months and forcefully converted her.

883,ezul4oj,"I don't think the jews are serial rapists. Muslims, on the other hand, follow sharia law, which is pretty clear on the belief than non-islamic women are lesser beings than goats.

In fact, take Ben Shapiro as an example: He has one wife, doesn't force her to wear a trash bag to cover herself head to toe, and in fact, Jewish women can marry whoever they want, even non-jews; It's Jewish men the ones who are discouraged from marrying outside their faith, as it is said that the faith passed matrilineally. Jews respect their women and will not force them into anything. A jewish girl isn't subjected to genital mutilation or given away to pedophiles the age of their grandfathers. Instead, they go to school, educate themselves and live their life to its fullest.

On the other hand, let's use your prophet as an example of what a muslim should act like, since you seem to anyway: Muhammad was very subservient to his first wife, but as he gained in power he became a very powerful warlord. Apparently, ""four wives should be enough for anyone""... except for himself, apparently. Also, why is a powerful God such as Allah catering to Muhammad's every whim? The catholic God never did this for any of His prophets, so why would Allah?

If Muhammad was uncomfortable with his guests, Allah sent a warning to leave him alone. If Muhammad wanted more wives than the current limit, Allah bent backward to please him.

**Allah is none other than Muhammad's sock puppet. You guys worship a pedophile's sock puppet.**"

have no problem removing abortion rights from rape victims

support politicians who are rapists and had sexual relationships with minors

The hijab is evil while defending Christians who require women cover their heads/don’t cut hair and dress as modestly as Muslim women while judging women who don’t abide by their rules as whores.

886,el4isv8,"It is a problem because non-white women virtually never get with white men. If they did to roughly the same extent as white women get with non-white men, then fine. But they do not, and the media virtually always pairs a white woman with a black man in order to represent any kind of couples (you do see black women with white men in some ads more often than in the past, though).

There is also a huge problem in Europe where the Muslim immigrants rape the white women, and the white women generally just pity them and let them off the hook. Even if not, the police either do not bother to arrest them or even make a report, and even if they do, the Muslim rapist just gets a joke sentence in a cushy daycare center of a prison. Conversely, it is completely unheard of for white non-Muslims to rape Muslim women, in either Europe or elsewhere. This has been true throughout the history of Islam.

When it comes to dating/marriage, Muslim men have the lion's share of interracial dating, and often get with white women with ease. Muslim women are forbidden to even be alone with white non-Muslim men, let alone fuck them, and as such it almost never happens. That's what a silent genocide looks like; hypergamy, rapes that go unreported/unavenged, denial of marriage/breeding concerning one male group to either one or all female groups.

I’m familiar with the hadith in which Muhammad sentenced death for the rape of presumably a Muslim woman (it didn’t clarify). But, out of curiosity, what’s the justification for a married rapist being more heavily punished than an unmarried rapist when the crime itself is just as terrible?

Checked the consensus of “major sins” Muslim scholars across sects agree on, and forcing a women into marriage is not among them. I see how you could pull the view that if the women doesn’t agree, the marriage isn’t Islamically binding, so any sex had during the marriage is zina which is a major sin, but otherwise, what you claim isn’t explicitly a “major sin.” If you could provide the hadith you’re using to back this up, then I’ll try to see your point, but it’s not really holding up. "
889,ecxzbs2,"During a debate where someone criticising Islam said it's because of Islam that women don't get same opportunity as men to pursue education. A  Muslim lady said that Muhammed never said women sudnt be educated. The first word revealed is ""read"".  So you are wrong. The reply was that Islam places a high emphasis on virginity of women and gender segregation is strictly followed. As obviously everywhere men are given priority for education, people often pull out their daughters for the fear of her getting corrupted( have affairs, lose virginity), her job options get limited too because most work places are male dominant everywhere. 

So many things Islam doesn't specially ask you to do like keep women home and not educate her but they are a product of Islamic ideology and rules, even honor killing is a result of that. Outside Muslim world you will find honor killings mostly in India. Now relating the honor of family to the lifestyle and character of the women of the household isn't unique to Islam. Obviously so many cultures and societies practice it. But as most have evolved out of it or at least have the hope of evolving except a religious society which is resistant to change. Similarly rapes now it's no brainer that every society and country will have rape issues. It's not specific to Muslims. Except maybe the sex slaves but I will let it pas. when a society puts a huge value on the Chasity of women , they are less likely to report rape for the fear of losing honor. And that encourages rapists, he will get away with it as most people are too concerned about their honor to report it.

I have even read the case where an islamic school banned women from running because they might end up losing Virginity. Another article how more muslim women are seeking proof of their Virginity in the west before marriage to show it to their potential spouse. You can only imagine if such society will encourage reporting rape or women working among men.

Now there might be cases where people have unfairly criticized Islam but many times it is justified.

Edit: honor killing and rapists getting away with crimes are more likely to happen in a country which valued virginity and puts a huge value on the character and lifestyle of the women of the household. That's why they are not unique problem of Islamic world but other societies have the hope of somehow changing the attitude, Muslims are too rigid and resistant hence people end up criticizing Islam for these issues."
890,e7zet1b,"Also, the united states is number one on the list in the world, not a great list to be number one on.  ""The super power of the world is at the first position in the race of rapes. Males are majorly the rapist holding a proportion of 99%. Out of all the victims, 91% are females while 9% are males. The U.S Bureau of Justice Statistics states that 91% of rape victims are female and 9% are male, and nearly 99% of rapists are male. According to the National Violence Against Women Survey, 1 in 6 U.S. women and 1 in 33 U.S. men has experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime. More than a quarter of college-age women report having experienced a rape or rape attempt since age 14. Out of all, only 16% of the total cases are reported. Outdoor rape is not common in USA rather most of the rape cases takes place inside homes.""

Saleh is correct (Qur’an 4:3, 4:24, 23:1-6, 33:50, 70:30), contradicting the Western politically correct dupes who incessantly rationalize or downplay these gross human rights abuses. As Robert Spencer [**noted**](https://www.jihadwatch.org/2018/03/uk-seven-muslims-convicted-of-running-predatory-rape-gang-abusing-non-muslim-girls-as-young-as-13) some days ago: “One survivor of a Muslim rape gang in the UK said that [**her rapists would quote Quran to her, and believed their actions justified by Islam.”**](https://www.jihadwatch.org/2018/03/uk-survivor-of-muslim-rape-gangs-says-rapists-would-quote-quran-to-her-believed-their-actions-justified-by-islam)

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Glover noted:

&gt; This group of men subjected them to an almost unimaginable level of cruelty and sexual abuse over a significant period of time.

The UK has become a subjugated land, where Muslim rapists are tolerated and [**those who speak out against Islamization are banned and shunned**](https://www.rt.com/uk/421030-free-speech-martin-sellner/) by the establishment — including Robert Spencer. Only one book actually exists in the UK on the Muslim rape gangs called *Easy Meat, Inside Britain’s Grooming Gang Scandal*, by Peter McLoughlin. To hear an interview with the author, click [**here**](https://www.jihadwatch.org/2018/03/talking-with-the-author-of-the-only-book-on-muslim-rape-gangs-in-the-uk).

In addition to the Muslim rape gang abuses against infidel girls, last year a UK Sharia court did the unthinkable: it handed down a sentence [**approving of honor killing.**](https://www.jihadwatch.org/2017/01/uk-sharia-court-hands-down-sentence-of-honor-killing) Many Muslim women are sent back home by those same courts, to be further abused by their husbands.

892,dw37ok4,"&gt;Muslim women are raped and then executed for adultery.

I don't know where or if this happens, but it obviously goes against Islam.    
Same applies to what you said in your other comment, ""women in Saudi Arabi are being killed for being women"", and as someone who has been actually living here for a years now, I can't find any bases for that, sure, no place is perfect, but comparing it what what I hear about rape statistics in a country like America for example, and how rarely rapists are punished, I'd say some people need to reconsider their priorities.

&gt;Your opinion as a Muslim can change these stupid laws.

Not really..

&gt;Mine can't so it's not important why I think how I do.

I think sharing your opinion about any topic in a clear and healthy manner is useful, sure you probably won't see an instant 180 degree change in anything, but change takes time.

&gt;I'm not the one raping girls and then stoning them to death for adultery.

Are you accusing me of something here..?

Anyway, back to your main point.

&gt;Can I ask you to share your reasons for supporting this?

""This"" as in ""Killing, raping, and enslaving women""?    
We seem to have a misunderstanding here, so I'm going to assume that by ""this"" you mean ""Islam"" or ""Islamic teachings"".

Generally, I think Islam has honoured women a lot, and introduced many laws guarantee their rights, including things that are considered a result of feminist movements in modern times/past few decades.    
Things like owning property, collecting inheritance, getting education, the right to vote, the right to work, including being politicians and scholars, and the list goes on, keep in mind we're talking about laws made 1400 years ago (not to mention ending a disgusting practice that was relatively common at that time, where female infant used to be burried alive, especially if they were the first born).    
An interesting example: The first University in history was found by a Muslim woman, Fatemah Al-Fihri.

If we're to go into more specific details and examples, a woman can not be forced into a marriage, that would automatically invalidate it.

Marriage in Islam is an agreement between two people, based on love and caring, that is clear from both the Quran and Sunna, it's not ""slavery"" as I hear some people say (interesting small detail: Muslim women don't change their names upon marriage).

Not sure what else to add, there's many examples and no one particular ""reason"" or a set of reasons, but a statement I once heard is ""Islam has raised women so high that Heaven lies beneath their feet""

I apologize if some of this doesn't seem coherent or related, it's really early and I'm tired, I'd be happy to clarify anything that doesn't seem clear though.

But in summary, I support ""this"" because ""this"" is not what you think it is."
893,dmhg9i2,"Theocracies are a terrible thing. It's not about Islam, per se -- it can be a great religion or a terrible religion, like most of the rest. It's about theocracies. Right now, there are a lot of Islamic theocracies, and many of them are fucking terrible. 

The apologism certainly goes too far, but there's also a tendency to paint Islam as like, ""the bad religion,"" which is bullshit bc Christianity's done so much fucked up shit too (including so much rape culture). Conflating *forcing a woman to marry her rapist*, which is **disgusting**, with girls and women who choose to wear the hijab (which should never be forced, and which, in some places, *is* forced) is also really fucked up and wrong, and that is worth saying because in America, girls wearing the hijab are attacked for it -- because Muslim women are so much more visible than Muslim men, this too is a feminist issue. 

tl;dr = theocracies bad, religion sometimes bad sometimes good or neutral. "
894,dmuaj5r,"You are very correct. I have taken into consideration of the fact that Muslim women are generally very quiet about such crimes and Muslim societies usually cover such things up in order to 'save face', or kill the woman out of an 'honor killing'. The first part of that I can definitely understand, but the second just seems barbaric. Why should a woman be blamed or killed for something that wasn't her fault? I also don't understand how even in Western society rape victims can also be blamed, or otherwise shamed for it (you see this a lot in terms of being accused ""racist"" when condemning an attacker that is from a foreign background, which makes no sense whatsoever because the crime is entirely outside of the ethnic background of the rapist). Unfortunately, all of this is actually making people more racist than they otherwise would have been, because if the matter was simply settled without political correctness and the rapist was justly sentenced to a decent amount of hard time, most people would simply move on and the problems would eventually lessen.

Still, I can really only find stuff about the slave trades and raids done by Muslims, as well as the Armenian genocide, and last but not certainly least, the rape crisis brought on by refugees and ISIS. Of course white people can be the same way, at least potentially, but it usually doesn't get talked about outside of the Bosniak genocide (which was genuinely horrible, but paled in comparison to the Armenian genocide). I know that there was a minor slave trade of Muslims by white Christians in Italy and Spain, but it doesn't get talked about very often and they often enslaved other Christians as well (although those ones would often be freed eventually). There is also the expansion of the Russian empire into the Caucasus region, which resulted in a lot of deportation, death and destruction of Muslims in the region, and they were also in northern Iran for a time. All in all you can't tell all that well, but it is still very odd that I can barely find anything about how it may have been roughly equivalent on both sides, and this is from using all kinds of search engines."
895,dn56p0w,"Under Islamic law, the rights of women are severely restricted. This is why women often experience a lot of oppression in societies that are majority Muslim. Saudi-Arabia is an extreme example of such a society. It illustrates the ""end-game"" of a traditional interpretation of Islamic law. In Saudi-Arabia, women experience the following things:

* They are not allowed to vote.
* They are not allowed to drive cars.
* They have to wear concealing clothing and headscarves. Muslims believe that the body of a woman ""tempts"" men. They believe that if a woman doesn't cover up, she is to blame if a man rapes her. 
* Husbands can legally beat and abuse their wifes. Married women are essentially property of the husband under Saudi law.
* If a woman is raped, often she will be blamed for it, and not the rapist.
* Women are not allowed to play sports.
* Female testimony is worth less in the eyes of the Saudi legal system. 
* Women are often not incentivized to pursue a career or higher education. Instead, Saudi society believes women should only involve themselves with traditional activities, such as housework, raising children, cooking, and so on.
* Women are not allowed to go outside without a man. This male guardian should either be her husband, or a blood relative. So women in Saudi-Arabia don't leave the house much.
* Women should always obey their husband, according to Saudi law.
* etc. etc.

As you can see, being a woman in an Islamic society like Saudi-Arabia is *shit*. Of course, Saudi-Arabia is the most extreme out of all Islamic societies, but that doesn't mean that being a female in other majority-Islamic countries is fun either. From Morocco to Pakistan, from Iraq to Somalia, Muslim women are being oppressed.

They also threatened to kill other kids and harm others - the muslim women are just as bad - so are the white women in gov, they help the rapists

You also cannot trust what is going on - raped, taken to hospital, minders who are controlling her, she's trying to escape, she's been restricted in her movements and she's scared - getting abused and kept where she is"
898,g00ymzu,Wow islamic women are pretty  much slaves spoken like a true karen. It seems you have pretty much established a notion without understanding complexities of a way of life and giving much thought about the different shades of life of a muslim woman . You strike me just like some people I know who say homosexuals are pretty much abomination of humanity.
899,g0qdp9w,"I do not blame the women in patriarchal countries. In Islam (like all patriarchal religions), non-procreative sex is haraam. These women are also conditioned from birth to be breeding slaves chained to the household. That is how many of these women survive. 
 
There is no sex education. Contraceptives are illegal. Abortions are illegal. Martial rape is legal. Many of these women had no choice. Islamic women are threatened to submit to their husband or they can get beaten. 

Women are breeding cattle in Islam."
900,fyw6v6a,"**""Women have the right to his money, AND to keep hers. He HAS to take care of her even if she's a millionaire""**

**""She doesn't need permission to spend her own wealth""**

When I did have money, I was told what to do with it, and forbidden from spending it without asking him first.

**""She isn't required to cook or clean if it's not common in her culture. If maids are common, he must provide one or pay his wife for her services""**

Hubby provided a fatwa cancelling this one, that a wife must obey his commands in all things that are not haram, no matter what he asks of her. This includs him forcing her to work outside the home for money to give to him. It also included forcing his children and/or slaves to work outside to earn him money.

I couldn't breastfeed (my body didn't produce more than a few drops) and was constantly insulted for being a bad mother, threatened with him taking my son and giving him to his SIL because she's a ""good mother"", and told that I will be going to hell for not feeding his son.

There's more but you get my point. Women have **no** autonomy in islam, no matter how old they get. A 56 year old women must still ask permission to do things that any other woman on earth would not need permission for after the age of 18. The fact that muslim men find it acceptable to treat us this way is disgusting."

902,g0vqo3q,"But we're talking about slaves, so it's irrelevant who they could marry, especially when the male slaves were castrated. And while the US did ban interracial marriages, islam bans interfaith marriages based on gender.  
  
As for the other religions, read what I wrote. They don't take it seriously anymore. Jews and Christians both have high rates of interfaith marriages among both genders. Muslim women are the most restricted in this sense, not only restricted but physically invisible due to covering up, being stuck in the house, and very few can participate in sports I don't care if there are female muslims in the Olympics it's still much more rare than females in other religions.

904,fuyuvvy,Mmmm that’s all you Muslim women are good for: sucking white cock like our slaves
905,fv6o2dx,"Praise be to Allaah.

First of all it is essential to know that Muslim men and Muslim women are obliged to follow the commands of Allaah and His Messenger, no matter how difficult that may be for people and without feeling shy of other people. The believer who is sincere in his faith is the one who is sincere in carrying out his duty towards his Lord and obeying His commands and avoiding that which He has forbidden. No believer, man or woman, has the right to hesitate or delay with regard to commands; rather he or she should hear and obey immediately, in accordance with words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):

“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision” [al-Ahzaab 33:36]  

This is the case with the believers who are praised by their Lord in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):

“The only saying of the faithful believers, when they are called to Allaah (His Words, the Qur’aan) and His Messenger, to judge between them, is that they say: “We hear and we obey.” And such are the successful (who will live forever in Paradise).

And whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger , fears Allaah, and keeps his duty (to Him), such are the successful” [al-Noor 24:51-52]  

Moreover, the Muslim should not look at how small or great the sin is, rather he should look at the greatness and might of the One Whom he is disobeying, for He is the Most Great, the Most High; He is Mighty in strength and Severe in punishment, and His punishment is severe and painful and humiliating. If He exacts vengeance on those who disobey Him, then utter destruction will be their fate. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“Such is the Seizure of your Lord when He seizes the (population of) towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His Seizure is painful (and) severe.

Indeed in that (there) is a sure lesson for those who fear the torment of the Hereafter. That is a Day whereon mankind will be gathered together, and that is a Day when all (the dwellers of the heavens and the earth) will be present” [Hood 11:102-103]

 A sin may appear insignificant in the eyes of a person when before Allaah it is serious, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“you counted it a little thing, while with Allaah it was very great”

[al-Noor 24:15]  

This matter is as some of the scholars said: “Do not look at the smallness of the sin, rather look at the One Whom you are disobeying.” We have to obey Allaah and do as He commands. We must remember that He is watching in secret and in public, and avoid that which He has forbidden.  

With regard to belief, if a Muslim who prays commits some sins or bad deeds, he is still a Muslim so long as he does not commit any action which would put him beyond the pale of Islam or do any of the things which nullify Islam. This sinful Muslim will be subject to the will of Allaah in the Hereafter; if He wills He will punish him, and if He wills He will forgive him. If he enters Hell in the hereafter, he will not abide there forever. But no person can be certain as to his fate, as to whether the punishment will befall him or not, because this matter is known only to Allaah.  

Sins are divided into two categories, minor and major. Minor sins may be expiated for by prayer, fasting and righteous deeds. Major sins (which are those concerning which a specific warning has been narrated, or for which there is a specific hadd punishment in this world or torment in the Hereafter) cannot be expiated for by righteous deeds. Rather the one who commits such sins has to repent sincerely from them. Whoever repents, Allaah will accept his repentance. There are many kinds of major sins such as lying, zinaa, riba (usury/interest), stealing, not wearing hijaab at all, and so on.  

Based on the above, we cannot say for certain whether a woman who does not wear hijaab will enter Hell, but she deserves the punishment of Allaah because she has disobeyed His command to her.  With regard to her specific fate, Allaah knows best what it will be. We cannot speak about things of which we have no knowledge, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“And follow not (O man, i.e., say not, or do not, or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart of each of those ones will be questioned (by Allaah)” [al-Israa’ 17:36]

 It is sufficient deterrent for the Muslim whose heart is aware to know that if he does a certain action he will be exposed to the punishment of his Lord, because His punishment is severe and painful, and His Fire is hot indeed.  

“The Fire of Allaah, kindled,

Which leaps up over the hearts” [al-Humazah 104:6-7]  

On the other hand, for the woman who obeys her Lord’s commands – including observing complete hijaab – we hope that she will enter Paradise and attain the victory of salvation from the Fire and its torments. 

It is strange indeed that a woman whose character is good, and who prays and fasts and does not look at boys, and avoids gossip and backbiting, does not wear hijaab. If a person really achieves these righteous deeds, this is a strong indication that she loves goodness and hates evil. Let us not forget that prayer prevents immorality and evil, and that good deeds bring more of the same. Whoever fears Allaah concerning his nafs, Allaah will support him and help him against his nafs. It seems that there is much goodness in this Muslim woman, and she is close to the path of righteousness. So she should strive to wear hijaab as her Lord has commanded her. She should ignore the specious arguments and resist the pressures of her family. She should not listen to the words of those who criticize her, and she should ignore the specious arguments of those sinful women who want to make a display of themselves according to fashion, and she should resist the desires of her own self which may tempt her to show off her beauty and feel proud of it. She should adhere to that which will afford her protection and modesty, and rise above being a mere commodity to be enjoyed by every evil person who comes and goes. She should refuse to be a source of temptation to the slaves of Allaah. We appeal to her faith and her love for Allaah and His Messenger, and we urge her  to  observe the hijaab enjoined by Allaah and to obey the commands of Allaah (interpretation if the meanings):  

“and not to show off their adornment” [al-Noor 24:31]

“and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance, and perform As Salaah (Iqamat as Salaah), and give Zakaah and obey Allaah and His Messenger”[al-Ahzaab 33:33]  

And Allaah is the Source of strength and the Guide to the Straight Path."
906,fvdrqv9,"Muslim women are sex slaves now, wow..."
907,fw3lqqp,"&gt;Have similar feelings when I see a Muslim woman wearing a hijab.

Maybe you'd have different feelings if you had a different context. Did you know the word *hijab* as used in the Quran never connotes an act of piety? Rather, it carries the negative connotation of being an actual or metaphorical obstacle separating the “non-believers” in a dark place (41:5), a wall of separation between those in Muslim heaven and those in Muslim hell (7:46).

It is never used in the Quran to mean ""headscarf."" The word *hijab* literally translates as “curtain” in Arabic. It also means hiding, obstructing, and isolating someone or something. In colloquial Arabic, the word for headscarf is *tarha.* In classical Arabic, head is *al-ra’as* and cover is *gheta’a.* No matter what formula you use, ""hijab"" never means headscarf.

Muslim women are attacked, even disfigured and blinded by acid, for daring to refuse the hijab. Many Muslim women strongly object to wearing it. Rita Panahi wrote an article titled, ""The hijab is a symbol of oppression. Please don’t celebrate it."" You can read it [here](http://archive.is/kYD3P). Other Muslim women, for example Asra Nomani and Hala Arafa, have also [asked non-Muslims not to celebrate the hijab](http://archive.is/phjp3). Ayaan Hirsi Ali asserts that the hijab marks a woman as private and restricted property, a non-person, and reduces her to her genitalia. 

A piece of cloth - the hijab - is supposed to check otherwise uncontrollable sexual appetites of Muslim men (Quran 33:59). This ideology promotes a social attitude that absolves men of sexually harassing and raping women and puts the onus on the victim to protect herself by covering up (""Either you wear a veil or you get raped,"" prominent Islamic scholar, [Tariq Ramadan,](http://archive.is/WfcDO) to one of his own rape victims in France). 

This reflects an important, and deeply flawed, concept in Islam called the ""external locus of control."" This is a psychological term that refers to someone believing the cause and responsibility for their personal behavior lies *outside* themselves, not *within,* as we believe. 

The external locus of control is foreign to any Catholic. You can read more about Islam and the external locus of control in [this article](http://archive.is/e2178) by a Danish psychologist.

Islam teaches that women are dirty (Quran 2:222, 4:43, and 5:6), mentally deficient (Sahih Bukhari 48:826, Tabari I:280, Sahih Bukhari 6:301), and unfit as leaders (Sahih Bukhari 88:219). Wives are sex objects for Muslim men's use (Quran 2:223, Sahih Bukhari 62:81 and 7:62:132). Wives can be raped (Quran 2:223) in any position (Sunan Abu Dawud 2159), beaten and scourged (Quran 4:34, Sahih Muslim 4:2127, Sahih Bukhari 7:72:715, Tabari IX:113, and many more), and must remain in abusive marriages (Sahih Bukhari 72:715). 

Non-Muslim women can be held captive as rape slaves (Quran 4:24-25, 23:5-6, 24:34, 33:52, 70:29-30 and 35). All women are inherently inferior to men (Quran 2:228) and can only inherit half of what a man inherits (Quran 4:11; see also 4:176). A woman's testimony in court is only worth half of a man's testimony (Sahih Bukhari 5:59:462). Most women go to Muslim hell (Quran 37:22-23, Sahih Bukhari 2:28, 2:18:161, 7:62:125; Sahih Muslim 36:6600). 

Islam embraces and promotes polygamy (Quran 4:3, 4:129), rape (4:24, 8:69, 23:5-6, 33:50, and many more) and pedophilia (Quran 65:4, Sahih Muslim 4:26:3380, and many more). The demon-god Allah repeatedly reduced women to the status of dogs, pigs, monkeys, and asses (Sahih Bukhari 1.9.490, and many more). The mere presence of a woman can sever a man's prayer (Abu Dawud 2:704). How can any Catholic woman countenance or admire any of that? What the hijab represents is disgusting and brutal and antithetical to Catholic beliefs. Please learn more about it. As Catholic women, we can stand with disempowered women in Islam, instead of admiring an instrument used in their suppression."

And for beds I realized when I went to the US that the beds were so high I’ve never seen any beds like that before and I’ve been in good hotels in another countries and never saw any bed as high as in the US ."
910,frjj3i0,"My heart goes out to you. You went into this relationship in good faith, but no matter how moderate or progressive a muslim says they are, you have to keep in mind *what* *they* *progressed* *from*. This is a religion based on the other abrahamic ones, but is *extremely* misogynistic in comparison.
And while religious indoctrination is a very powerful thing, the actual perks you get for being a man in islam make it hard to resist. 
I'm sorry to say it, but this was a wasted effort. You weren't ever going to get a partner who would treat you as an equal. I find it hard to believe any man can look a woman in the eyes and say he respects her as human being if he is muslim. The religion itself didn't allow them to. When they've got literally rules about how to discipline your wives(!) and verses telling you to not feel guilty about having sex with your sex slaves(!!), you've got to understand their mindset. 
Since he went for the 55 year package, he probably thought you guys would be together a while lol. Keep in mind he could have divorced you with three words, at any time. But if you weren't going to fall in line and become a good muslim wife, he was def going to find himself one who was already trained for this. Muslim women are groomed to serve men, be sexually obedient and financially dependent. You would never have fit in."
911,fs7xoas,That married muslim women are like slaves towards their husband.
912,fs9ton8,"Jacksepticeye I am a Pakistani Muslim man from the United Kingdom and as a Muslim are very hurt with the Fact that Muslims are in concentration camps in China. But something far worse Is happened now I do not know if anyone will ever see this but if you do please make a video on this and for anybody else who sees this speak up about what I am going to tell you. In China right now at this very moment they are over 5,000 Muslims being captured from their homes and loved ones and caged up daily in concentration camps and not enough people know about this. The Chinese racist government have been quiet about this on social media. Never the less, these Muslims are being treated worse than when Hitler tortured Jews in concentration camps. For example, Muslims are not allowed to practice their faith in any sort of way, Muslim women are forced to Marry none-Muslim men where they are raped every day, they are also made as sex slaves, they are also forced to eat pork which within our religion is forbidden, they are also not allowed to pray to god and they are forced work every day with little food and water. This obviously illegal and in humane Now it’s disgusting that everybody who knows about this do not tell other people but as a fellow Muslim are hurt deeply sorrowful and hopeful that one day these Muslims are set free but in order for that to happen I need so many of you to SPEAK OUT about this RACISM! Hopefully someone sees this and sends it everywhere online thank you very much if you have spoken up about this racism and may god bless you all and the Muslims in those concentration camps. #MuslimsLivesMatter"
913,ft2n30d,"I just studied the history of Asia minor, and they had abundant slavery.  The Barbary coast slave trade lasted from the 16th to 18th centuries. The Slavic people were the original slaves of the Ottoman Empire. Thats where the word slave originally comes from, you can buy yourself a Slav.  Muslim women are bronzed beauties of high status but, because of that they have rights under Islam.  Therefore captured Slavic women are the fair haired beauties who staff the Hareem. The fair skinned beauty standards of today stem from the advertising propaganda of slave barkers promoting the sale of fair haired Circassian women trafficked into conjugal servitude in Tripolitania (now Libya, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.)"
914,ftddnsr,"I’m just defining how Islam legalises men to cheat their wife, a sex slave. All Muslim women are slaves in Islam’s view"
915,fnj5ffd,You straight-up stated in your original comment that Islamic women are made into slaves. That’s xenophobic- and comes full circle to your lack of understanding of Islam and religion as a whole.
916,fllhzmn,"•	⁠To answer your last paragraph, I think that a large part of support of head coverings from Islamic women is caused by indoctrination by their fathers/male religious authorities as I mentioned in my post. And sure, I am an outsider who may not know all the meanings of their books, but when I see

Quran (4:24) and Quran (33:50) - A man is permitted to take women as sex slaves outside of marriage.

Hadith and Sadira

Sahih Bukhari (6:301) - ""[Muhammad] said, 'Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?' They replied in the affirmative. He said, 'This is the deficiency in her intelligence.'""

Abu Dawud (2155) - Women are compared to slaves and camels with regard to the ""evil"" in them.

These are some egregious examples. Even in developed countries like the US Muslim women are still essentially forced into submission with head coverings."
917,fg5g6tm,"What usul? He didn't even use a single usul, all he did is quote Qur'an texts (English language) and completely abandoned the Fiqh surrounding the texts.

&gt;Slave women during the Prophet's life and during the Khalifah Rashideen did not wear a khimar unless necessary. Slave women even were topless during the Khalifah Rashideen.

And? Umar (r) pointed out that free Muslim women are separated from slave women based on the Hijab when he criticized a slave woman for wearing hijab...... Are you now saying Muslims women are slaves &amp; that they don't need to wear the hijab??"
918,fg7bcuh,"&gt; He didn't even use a single usul, all he did is quote Qur'an texts (English language) and completely abandoned the Fiqh surrounding the texts.

You did not either listen or understand  in the video at the [13 second mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4hnD8DBdOo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=14)

Within the usul of all madhahib the default position everything is halal unless definitely declared haram by Qur'aan or sunnah. There is no definitive declaration in either. 

Now before we go further ""sin"" is an english word not an islamic one. The Qur'aan uses different words to describe [""sin""](http://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?t=1&amp;q=sin) yet none of these words are used within Quran nor Sunnah with the wearing or not wearing the khimar.

Now whether or not ""Hijab"" is mandatory for validity of salah is a different issue on whether or not ""Hijab"" is act that one must seek forgiveness for. Dr Ally was asked about wearing the hijab outside of salah. Now every madhab who holds the opinion not wearing the Hijab for women outside of salah is ""haram"" does so based upon interpretation based upon following their usul not definitive evidence. (You do know nearly all fiqh rulings are interpretative , don't know?) As most issues within fiqh. If most issues were definitive we wouldn't need madhahib after all.

There are many reasons why muslim women should wear the hijab (properly covering the awrah is the major one)  but saying women who do not outside of salah are engaging in act that could lead them to hellfire is an incredible statement that needs incredible proof. That was the point of Dr Ally statement.



&gt;That free Muslim women are separated from slave women based on the Hijab when he criticized a slave woman for wearing hijab...... Are you now saying Muslims women are slaves &amp; that they don't need to wear the hijab??

This is false equivalence. If you know during the time of Umar that slave women did not wear the khimar then doesn't prove that not wearing the khimar is  not a ""sin""?  If it were do you think Umar would command slave women to engage in ""sin"" against their Lord? Does that sound like Umar ibn al Khattab you know?"
919,fhb88q8,"Not all Muslim women are like this in the west Alhamdulilah. Taghut disgusts them and they stay away from kuffar men. It’s just the mostly the ones who are raised Muslim that become slaves of the west, in fact many of the best Muslim women in the west are converts."
920,fb01qeh,"If you'd read the Qur'an you'd be well aware of the likening of whites and Jews to pigs then, or how non Muslim women are viewed as slaves. Interesting. You realise this is an internet discussion right? I'm not writing a fully sourced legal essay, it's not my job to educate you. If you doubt something I say go prove me wrong if you're so bothered lol."
921,f59i8ks,Who said muslim women are turned into sex slaves?
922,f79qehw,"Muslim women are being chained to their husbands, chained mentally not allowing to use it to ask anything against and out of Islamic laws, restricted to houses, not allowing to work. They are being hit miserably and treated as slaves. Yeah not as extreme as black slaves.. But my whole point was  I was comparing only the common quality of both of them - ""praising their Masters"" I never compared both of those in each and every aspect and said Muslim women are being treated as slaves. So read properly before you comment"
923,ex50elo,"Slaves, huh? But you need to worry about keeping fit and young looking otherwise you’re worth less than a bag of trash. Old, fat, unattractive women in America NOTHING, yet Muslim women are “slaves”"

They're insane. But I already knew that."
925,f07u4nj,"&gt;There were eras in Xinjiang's history where intermarriage was common, ""laxity"" which set upon Uyghur women led them to marry Chinese men and not wear the veil in the period after Yaqub Beg's rule ended, it is also believed by Uyghurs that some Uyghurs have Han Chinese ancestry from historical intermarriage, such as those living in Turpan.[179]

&gt;Even though Muslim women are forbidden to marry non-Muslims in Islamic law, from 1880-1949 it was frequently violated in Xinjiang since Chinese men married Muslim Turki (Uyghur) women, a reason suggested by foreigners that it was due to the women being poor, while the Turki women who married Chinese were labelled as whores by the Turki community, these marriages were illegitimate according to Islamic law but the women obtained benefits from marrying Chinese men since the Chinese defended them from Islamic authorities so the women were not subjected to the tax on prostitution and were able to save their income for themselves. Chinese men gave their Turki wives privileges which Turki men's wives did not have, since the wives of Chinese did not have to wear a veil and a Chinese man in Kashgar once beat a mullah who tried to force his Turki Kashgari wife to veil. 

&gt;The local society accepted the Turki women and Chinese men's mixed offspring as their own people despite the marriages being in violation of Islamic law. Turki women also conducted temporary marriages with Chinese men such as Chinese soldiers temporarily stationed around them as soldiers for tours of duty, after which the Chinese men returned to their own cities.

&gt;Valikhanov claimed that foreigners children in Turkistan were referred to by the name çalğurt. Turki women were bashed as of being negative character by a Kashgari Turki woman's Tibetan husband- racist views of each other's ethnicities between partners in interethnic marriages still persisted sometimes. It was mostly Turki women marrying foreign men with a few cases of the opposite occurring in this era.[188] 

&gt;Childless, married youthful women were called ""chaucan"" in Turki, and Forsyth mission participant Dr. Bellew said that ""there was the chaucan always ready to contract an alliance for a long or short period with the merchant or traveller visiting the country or with anybody else"".[194][195] Henry Lansdell wrote in 1893 in his book Chinese Central Asia an account of temporary marriage practiced by a Turki Muslim woman, who married three different Chinese officers and a Muslim official.[196] The station of prostitutes was accorded by society to these Muslim women who had sex with Chinese men.[197] 

&gt;Turkic Muslims in different areas of Xinjiang held derogatory views of each other such as claiming that Chinese men were welcomed by the loose Yamçi girls.[198]

&gt;Le Coq reported that in his time sometimes Turkis distrusted Tungans (Hui Muslims) more than Han Chinese, so that a Tungan would never be given a Turki woman in marriage by her father, while a (Han) Chinese men could be given a Turki woman in marriage by her father.[200] 

&gt;""Certainly the mullas do their best to keep the fair sex in their place, and are in the habit of beating those who show their faces in the Great Bazar. But I was told that poetic justice had lately been meted out to one of these upholders of the law of Islam, for by mistake he chastised a Kashgari woman married to a Chinaman, whereupon the irate husband set upon him with a big stick and castigated him soundly.[201][202][203][204]""

&gt;""Almost every Chinaman in Yarkand, soldier or civilian, takes unto himself a temporary wife, dispensing entirely with the services of the clergy, as being superfluous, and most of the high officials also give way to the same amiable weakness, their mistresses being in almost all cases natives of Khotan, which city enjoys the unenviable distinction of supplying every large city in Turkestan with courtesans.""

&gt;""When a Chinaman is called back to his own home in China proper, or a Chinese soldier has served his time in Turkestan and has to return to his native city of Pekin or Shanghai, he either leaves his temporary wife behind to shift for herself, or he sells her to a friend. If he has a family he takes the boys with him~—if he can afford it—failing that, the sons are left alone and unprotected to fight the battle of life.""

&gt;That a Muslim should take in marriage one of alien faith is not objected to; it is rather deemed a meritorious act thus to bring an unbeliever to the true religion. The Muslim woman, on the other hand, must not be given in marriage to a non-Muslim; such a union is regarded as the most heinous of sins. In this matter, however, compromises are sometimes made with heaven: the marriage of a Turki princess with the emperor Ch'ien-lung has already been referred to; and, when the present writer passed through Minjol (a day's journey west of Kashgar) in 1902, a Chinese with a Turki wife (? concubine) was presented to him.

&gt;The marriages between Muslim (Uyghur) women and Han Chinese men infuriated the Uyghur leader Isa Yusuf Alptekin.[265]

&gt;Mixed Han-Uyghur partners were pressured to leave their parents and sometimes Xinjiang entirely. During the Republic era from 1911–1949, Han military generals were pursued and wooed by Uyghur women. In 1949 when the Communists took over, the Uyghur population branded such women as milliy munapiq (ethnic scum), threatening and coercing them in accompanying their Han partners in moving to Taiwan and ""China proper."" Uyghur parents warned such women not to return any of their children, male or female, to Xinjiang after moving to ""China proper"" for attending educational institutions. This was so they could avoid ostracism and condemnation from their fellow Uyghurs. A case where a Han male dating a Uyghur woman and then a Han man and her elder sister incited the Uyghur community to condemn and harass her mother.[266]

 (4:34) Men are the protec-tors and maintainers of women56 because Allah has made one of them excel over the other,57 and because they spend out of their possessions (to support them). Thus righteous women are obedient and guard the rights of men in their absence under Allah's protection.58 **As for women of whom you fear rebellion, admonish them, and remain apart from them in beds, and beat them**.59 Then if they obey you, do not seek ways to harm them. Allah is Exalted, Great. 

&amp;#x200B;

 (Sahih al Bukhari 5825) Rifa\`a divorced his wife whereupon \`AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. \`Aisha said that the lady (came), wearing a green veil (and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and showed her a green spot on her skin caused by beating). It was the habit of ladies to support each other, so when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came, \`**Aisha said, ""I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women.** Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!""

Mohammed is quoted as saying that Blacks are, ""pug-nosed slaves"". (Sahih Moslem vol. 9 pages 46 and 47).

""Ham \[Africans\] begat all those who are black and curly-haired, while Japheth \[Turks\] begat all those who are full-faced with small eyes, and Shem \[Arabs\] begat everyone who is handsome of face with beautiful hair. Noah prayed that the hair of Ham's descendants would not grow beyond their ears, and that whenever his descendants met Shem's, the latter would enslave them."" \~Tabari II:21  


""It is your folly to fight the Apostle, for Allah's army is bound to disgrace you. We brought them to the pit. Hell was their meeting place. We collected them there, black slaves, men of no descent."" \~Ishaq 450  


""The black troops and slaves of the Meccans cried out and the Muslims replied, ‘Allah destroy your sight, you impious rascals.'"" \~Ishaq 374  


""The Prophet said, ‘Let the negro slave of Dinar perish. And if he is pierced with a thorn, let him not find anyone to take it out for him.... If he \[the black slave\] asks for anything it shall not be granted, and if he needs intercession \[to get into paradise\], his intercession will be denied.'"" \~Bukhari:V4B52N137  


Qur'an \[39.60\] And on the day of resurrection you shall see those who lied against Allah; their faces shall be blackened. Is there not in hell an abode for the proud? (Why was ""black"" equated with evil in Islam?)​

933,epcysm8,"&gt;At least he’s trying to promote women’s rights

Is he? Here he is on Twitter [pushing a two volume manual of Sharia (Islamic law).](http://magaimg.net/img/830t.png) Let's review a little of what Sharia says about women, shall we?

* Women are inherently inferior to men. Koran 2:228 
* Women may only inherit half of what a man inherits. Koran 4:11; see also 4:176
* Women are dirty. Koran 2:222, 4:43, and 5:6
* Wife beating is permitted. Koran 4:34
* Wives are sex objects for Muslim men's use. Koran 2:223
* Non-Muslim women are rape slaves. Koran 4:24-25, 23:5-6, 24:34, 33:52, 70:29-30 and 35
* Most women go to Muslim hell. Koran 37:22-23
* Polygamy is permitted. Koran 4:3 and 4:129
* Wife-swapping is permitted.  Koran 4:20
* Pedophilia is permitted. Koran 65:4

I know Tawhidi pretends to love to dismiss the ahadith but look again: *that is all in the Koran.*

How many times does this need to be said? **IMAMS LIE.**

*Islam is deception.* Islam TELLS Muslims over and over and over in the Koran, ahadith, sira, and Islamic law, to DECEIVE and LIE to us non-Muslims in endless variety of ways and methods. Remember that to a Muslim - any Muslim, that includes Tawhidi - you are **sub-human** (Koran 8:55 and 98:6). Lying to you *doesn't matter* in the least."
934,eptdmwc,"Oh i don't, right? I've bloody faced beatings for speaking out on this. Go ahead, prove to me what you say is true.

Don't, and you're a liar"
935,eq8xa0w,"1)Go read about the Persian conflict. Marriage processions were raided and female were forced into slavery without any offer for peace/surrender.

2)The Persian princess was humiliated and her viel was taken away from her so that her buyers could examine her.

3) So people have to jump into fires for you believe that women were forced?

4) There is no proof that having sex with slaves needs to consent and compiling proofs you cannot claim that groups like ISIS and Book Haram are acting outside the fold of Islam.

5) So if I wanted to take you girls I just have to behead you, right? They'll get wet seeing your dead head in my arms, that's the logic your pushing nah? And why shouldn't I keep some ppl away from this examples? Non-muslim women and Muslim women are both humans."
936,eqo1v8u,"We haven't had slaves in this country in over 150 years.  You can ask them, their owners, or even their children, as they aren't alive anymore.   But you can ask your housekeeper, cant you.

And it's not a myth lol  17% of Islamic women are married before the age of 18.  3% before 15. Often to men in their 30-50's.  Those are children and it's happening litterally daily, right now."
937,em0nt4i,"You’re wrong.

The majority of these women don’t want to live as walking trash bags and are waiting for westernized governments to tell their barbarian husbands to take their fucking leashes off of them.

Make no mistake, Muslim women are slaves, and most of them see how the rest of the world lives and they want out.

This is only a positive."
938,em3xdim,There’s no women wearing these things under Sharia Law. It’s fake. The corporations are lying and trying to push this lie that Muslim women are free when really they are slaves (legally owned property).

Just like some slaves supported slavery because White man feeds them, cloth them and gives them free room &amp; board. Just like Milo being gay yet sides with conservatives that have a hard on against homosexuals.

بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ

السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته

**Respected Sister:**

*InshaAllah*, as a Muslim woman who loves Islam, I wanted to answer your questions herein to the best of my abilities. And I'm answering your post as a Muslim woman who absolutely adores her sisters in Islam and has no desire whatsoever to limit other Muslim women's options:

One of Allah's 99 names is *Al-Wadud*, meaning, ""The Loving."" Indeed, Allah is the author of all love. Without love, there would be no mercy or affinity among human beings. Allah is ***never*** oppressive of the desire to love or be loved. However, Allah desires that we as human beings understand what is love and to whom we should give that love which springs in our hearts. 

Allah doesn't desire His slaves, man or woman, to become embroiled in the modern dating scheme for the reason that this person may make plans to marry this person but what is the guarantee that this person is also written by Allah as this person's destined spouse? Allah doesn't desire heartache for His honorable slaves. And a person may plan but Allah also plans. And only Allah's Plans are what *will be*. 

""W*henever a man is alone with a woman, the devil makes a third.""* The Muslim men dating non-Muslim women are committing a sin. And Muslim women should not take them as inspiration to commit the same sins. Allah will question all on their own sins on Judgment Day.

In Islam, a man or a woman is not simply a physical/material being. That person has a heavenly/spiritual personality, that is, the soul, which desires to be set free to return to its Home, the Heavens. Given that each human being has been given a responsibility to discover and know this otherworldly personality which resides within us, any block spiritually is devastation for the hereafter. And remember Prophet *sallalahu alayhi wasallam* has informed us that sins are like black dots on the heart. Can anyone here imagine what complete devastation there would be for the heart and for the person's hereafter when the heart is fully black in this vein?

And therefore, it is important for a believer to invest that love that springs from the heart into Allah first. Only then is that love able to be channeled into love for human beings. The Qur'an (2:187) says specifically of the marital relationship, ""**They (your wives) are your garment and you are a garment for them.**"" This beautiful *ayat* makes clear the husband-wife relationship is to be the most intimate of relationships wherein both have the responsibility of another to cover, protect, and safeguard the interests of the other, to move in grace as analogically the garment which moves as one with the body and is loved by humans to be worn for practical as well as impractical reasons like beautifying the person (in the case of spousal relationship when extending this analogy enabling the beautification of the inward and outward character of the persons separately and jointly).

Any marital relationship will thereby be inherently unbalanced if a Muslim woman pursues it with a non-Muslim no matter how kind or nice the man is for the reasons that he will most likely not have mutual interest in helping her maintain specific obligations for the purposes of her *deen*: For example, a believing woman is restricted from have intercourse during her menstrual cycle, and a nonbeliever is less likely to understand or feel obliged to follow that restriction. A believing woman is obliged to fast in the month of Shahru Ramadan from sunrise to sunset and cannot have intercourse during that time, and a nonbeliever is less likely to understand or feel obliged to allow her that freedom to be free from his sexual advances for that given time period. Also, a Muslim woman must make ablution before praying and must be in that ritualistic state of purity when commencing prayer, which means she also cannot indulge his sexual play whenever she is about to pray. Also, a believer is not to engage in anal sex, which might not be able to be understood from a nonbeliever's point of view. The bedroom side of the matter is only one aspect.

The other aspects in which trouble may arise is finances and work: Many Muslims are renting or trying to find other ways of buying a home that do not include mortgage, and he may not be willing to accept that. I understand that Muslims indulge in the same sins today but at least a Muslim woman, if she's serious about her practice of her Islam, can try to find a Muslim on the same level of practice who believes as she does. It would be harder to convince a non-Muslim of that if he's always dreamed of owning a home in the vein of the American dream. Also, credit cards often carry interest and ideally are to be avoided at all costs. That's another area wherein she might have to compromise. And each compromise that she makes will take her further away from the d*een*. And, also, she may be pressed into working despite it being her Islamic right to stay at home if she so chooses.

Furthermore, a Muslim woman must raise her children in Islam, because it is a matter of both her and her children's hereafter; this might also likely be a point of contention in such a marriage; and even if an agreement is reached about the children being raised in Islam, it is likely the children will be confused about or grow distant from Islam seeing the father not following Islam. Moreover, in Islam, a believer has to pay *zakat*; and a nonbeliever might be less inclined to see that obligation as serving the household's combined financial interests. Also, a believing woman is obliged to make *Hajj*; and she will be unable to travel alongside a non-believing partner to do so, because non-Muslims are not allowed to enter the sacred place in Mecca. She will have to bear the hardships of journeying without a trusted partner to engage in the same goal. These things might seem small right at the outset when the embers of love first begin to grow, but, as the wise know, love does not always remain the passionate love of the first stage in a romantic relationship but transforms into a more knowing and comfortable kind of love later; and in that other stage, what might have seemed small then in the beginning is likely to grow into big differences or annoyances which have the power to break a loving relationship. And a relationship, from an Islamic standpoint, which did not build its foundation on the mutual love of Allah, which is considered **primordial** and **eternal**, is then less likely to last when temporal cracks appear.

In so far as Muslim men being allowed to marry the chase and righteous from among the People of the Book is concerned, please understand scholars of our time have been beginning to discourage it when possible. Having said that, scholars have been reluctant obviously to make the *halal* into *haram* as the Qur'an does grants that permission.

I understand this might seem discriminatory at the outset, but given what I've said of what Islam requires of believers, I think you'll be able to see why that permission is granted to Muslim men only. A Muslim man, even if he marries a wife from among the People of the Book, will be expected to refrain from intercourse with her during her menstrual cycles and to not engage in intercourse when he's fasting for Shahru Ramadan and never engage in anal sex. He will be able to make *Hajj* without feeling burdened by the hardships of the journey that a woman unaccompanied by a spousal partner might feel; and as women, we are more given to emotions dictating our general outlook. He may give *zakat* without secondary thought, especially as households around the globe due to patriarchal cultures dominating still witness men generally taking care of the bulk of finances; however, a Muslim woman, especially if she is financially dependent as a housewife, in other parts of the world might in the same arrangement not even be in position of bargaining to pay her obligation of *zakat* if she has a non-Muslim partner not so inclined. And so on and on.

I do *not* see the lack of Qur'an's permission as an injustice against my own gender; if you truly begin to reflect on what a marriage consists of in terms of sacrifices required, you'd realize that Islam is not preventing us from finding or acquiring the love we feel we deserve but is protecting us from unique harms that might emerge from such a marriage from the perspective of security for here and hereafter. And to be honest, if a Muslim woman truly believes in and loves Allah as per Islam, she is less likely to lust after the love of a man who does not believe in the same, because there would be no mutual foundation upon which to build the bridge to the hereafter in a partnership not based on the same. And even if she does happen to lust after the love of such a man, I truly hope she will find inner strength to give up that love, for the sake of Allah. That is why we as believers remind ourselves in prayer and outside of prayer, ""*AllahuAkbar*,"" which means, as we know, ""God is Greater.""

941,ek08y35,"&gt;	It’s religion, not culture. Big difference.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture

“Religion and expressive art are important aspects of human culture.”

Now let’s move onto the hijab/niqab/burka thing.

Verses that have to do with hijab: 

1 - Allah says:

“And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e. their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who have no sense of feminine sex. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of you beg Allaah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful”

[al-Noor 24:31] 

2 – Allaah says:

“And as for women past childbearing who do not expect wedlock, it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment. But to refrain (i.e. not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them. And Allaah is All‑Hearer, All‑Knower”

[al-Noor 24:60] 

“Women past childbearing” are those who no longer menstruate, so they can no longer get pregnant or bear children. 

3 – Allah says: 

“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allah is Ever Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”

[al-Ahzaab 33:59] 

4 – Allaah says: 

“O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet’s houses, unless permission is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation. But when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken your meal, disperse without sitting for a talk. Verily, such (behaviour) annoys the Prophet, and he is shy of (asking) you (to go); but Allah is not shy of (telling you) the truth. And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. And it is not (right) for you that you should annoy Allah’s Messenger, nor that you should ever marry his wives after him (his death). Verily, with Allah that shall be an enormity”

[al-Ahzaab 33:53] 

With regard to the Ahaadeeth: 

1 – It was narrated from Safiyyah bint Shaybah that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) used to say: When these words were revealed – “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – they took their izaars (a kind of garment) and tore them from the edges and covered their faces with them. 

Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4481. The following version was narrated by Abu Dawood (4102): 

May Allah have mercy on the Muhaajir women. When Allah revealed the words “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)”, they tore the thickest of their aprons (a kind of garment) and covered their faces with them. 

Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

This hadeeth clearly states that what the Sahaabi women mentioned here understood from this verse – “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – was that they were to cover their faces, and that they tore their garments and covered their faces with them, in obedience to the command of Allah in the verse where He said “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” which meant covering their faces. Thus the fair-minded person will understand that woman’s observing hijab and covering her face in front of men is established in the saheeh Sunnah that explains the Book of Allah. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) praised those women for hastening to follow the command of Allah given in His Book. It is known that their understanding of the words “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” as meaning covering the face came from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because he was there and they asked him about everything that they did not understand about their religion. And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the Dhikr [reminder and the advice (i.e. the Qur’aan)], that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought”

[al-Nahl 16:44] 

Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari: There is a report of Ibn Abi Haatim via ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Uthmaan ibn Khaytham from Safiyyah that explains that. This report says: We mentioned the women of Quraysh and their virtues in the presence of ‘Aa’ishah and she said: “The women of Quraysh are good, but by Allah I have never seen any better than the women of the Ansaar, or any who believed the Book of Allaah more strongly or had more faith in the Revelation. When Soorat al-Noor was revealed – “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – their menfolk came to them and recited to them what had been revealed, and there was not one woman among them who did not go to her apron, and the following morning they prayed wrapped up as if there were crows on their heads. It was also narrated clearly in the report of al-Bukhaari narrated above, where we see ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who was so knowledgeable and pious, praising them in this manner and stating that she had never seen any women who believed the Book of Allah more strongly or had more faith in the Revelation. This clearly indicates that they understood from this verse – “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – that it was obligatory to cover their faces and that this stemmed from their belief in the Book of Allah and their faith in the Revelation. It also indicates that women’s observing hijab in front of men and covering their faces is an act of belief in the Book of Allah and faith in the Revelation. It is very strange indeed that some of those who claim to have knowledge say that there is nothing in the Qur’aan or Sunnah that says that women have to cover their faces in front of non-mahram men, even though the Sahaabi women did that in obedience to the command of Allah in His Book, out of faith in the Revelation, and that this meaning is also firmly entrenched in the Sunnah, as in the report from al-Bukhaari quoted above. This is among the strongest evidence that all Muslim women are obliged to observe hijab. 

Adwa’ al-Bayaan, 6/594-595. 

2 – It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that the wives of the Prophet used to go out at night to al-Manaasi’ (well known places in the direction of al-Baqee’) to relieve themselves and ‘Umar used to say to the Prophet, “Let your wives be veiled.” But the Messenger of Allah did not do that. Then one night Sawdah bint Zam’ah, the wife of the Prophet went out at ‘Isha’ time and she was a tall woman. ‘Umar called out to her: “We have recognized you, O Sawdah!” hoping that hijab would be revealed, then Allah revealed the verse of hijab. 

Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 146; Muslim, 2170. 

3 – It was narrated from Ibn Shihaab that Anas said: I am the most knowledgeable of people about hijab. Ubayy ibn Ka’b used to ask me about it. When the Messenger of Allah married Zaynab bint Jahsh, whom he married in Madeenah, he invited the people to a meal after the sun had risen. The Messenger of Allah sat down and some men sat around him after the people had left, until the Messenger of Allah stood up and walked a while, and I walked with him, until he reached the door of ‘Aa’ishah’s apartment. Then he thought that they had left so he went back and I went back with him, and they were still sitting there. He went back again, and I went with him, until he reached the door of ‘Aa’ishah’s apartment, then he came back and I came back with him, and they had left. Then he drew a curtain between me and him, and the verse of hijab was revealed. 

Al-Bukhaari, 5149; Muslim, 1428. 

4 – It was narrated from ‘Urwah that ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allah used to pray Fajr and the believing women would attend (the prayer) with him, wrapped in their aprons, then they would go back to their houses and no one would recognize them. 

Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 365; Muslim, 645. 

5 – It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The riders used to pass by us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (S) in ihraam, and when they drew near to us we would lower our jilbabs from our heads over our faces, then when they had passed we would uncover them again. 

Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1833; Ibn Maajah, 2935; classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah (4,203) and by al-Albaani in Kitaab Jilbaab al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah. "
942,ek4ol3s,"It doesn't matter if you meet [nice North Koreans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NIe8DkyknM&amp;t=36). Communism is still bad.

It doesn't matter if Tom Cruise is handsome and nice. Scientology is still [oppressive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBWJYDQrLQI).

It doesn't matter if Muslim women are [dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGN1h73hGoM&amp;t=9m31s). (They look like they're having fun.) This is not about the individual. It's about the *ideology*.

The leftist will give an anecdote about a ""nice, Muslim neighbor"" or ""nice, Muslim classmate"".  He wants you to look at a single tree while ignoring the forest.

Mohammed was the perfect Muslim, and [all Muslims must follow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXpX2OJhS2w&amp;t=44s) his example. He owned slaves, had multiple wives, and led wars.

It is completely rational and logical to think, ""When is the next jihad going to take place?"""
943,ekancy8,"Islamists literally keep sex slaves.  Under Islam, you aren't allowed to rape Muslim women, but non-muslim women are fair game.  Mohamed literally doled out sex slaves to his followers after every caravan raid he went on.

Also, btw, in Judaism/Christianity, rape was forbidden going back to the old testament.  It was a stoning offense.  Islam inherited that.  Mohamed just ""clarified"" that it only pertained to Muslim women.  "
944,ekr8mae,Muslim women are brainwashed brutalized slaves.
945,efmxbbq,"Traditionally, the hijab differentiated between ""free"" Muslim women on the street and non-Muslim women on the street, who might be slaves or dhimmis (second class citizens). Muslim women are owned by one man, the father or the husband and men are supposed to treat them respectfully, but the non-Muslim women were freely harassed on the street without social consequence and bought and sold and passed around like sex slaves. 
 ""Hijab is empowering"" is just another case of ""right wing women"" in action. 1.)Hijab=obedient muslim woman who has a husband or father to protect her, so back off. 2.)No hijab= disobedient woman that we can harass without consequence, or a religious minority who has no power and we can harass without consequence.

 I understand wanting to hide your body from men who look at you like hungry wolves but in the end it's still capitulating to the idea that you're the one who's at fault and must limit herself, and deal with the problem of badly-behaved men by hiding yourself, and also carries the inevitable insinuation that your sisters, the women who dont go the extra mile to cover up their whole heads or neck etc... are ""asking for it"".
 There's also the fact that in countries where hijab is common, street harassment isn't actually any less! And hijabis often face even more harassment simply because it's more ""fun"" for those assholes to harass a ""good girl"" because the men are taught good girls cover up, and more attractive girls hide their faces, even though that's not always true, it has that stigma. Thus, full niqab women are seen as more alluring, and face even more harassment. Because in the end, we still haven't rejected the idea that women=property. 
All the hijab does is reinforce that women are property and the most desirable property is that which you keep locked up and hidden, like a diamond behind a glass. There was a campaign by AlAzhar a few years ago in Egypt, comparing non-hijabi women to ""unwrapped candy"" you find on the street.
 Same country where street harassment is no better for women, either hijab or no hijab. There's been numerous articles by Egyptian women in BBC exposing this.

The one thing I liked about Muslim countries were the women's spaces like women's cars in the subway etc but unfortunately these were not enforced  much either and I often saw young boys and a few men loitering there, selling things. The other major problem with ""women designated"" cars or buses sends a message that a lone woman who's NOT on a woman's designated car, or daring to walk in an area where men frequent, is somehow ""free"" to harass and if she's raped or harassed, it's her fault for venturing out of ""the safe zone"". Why wasn't she in the women's car? Why was she in a cafe where men smoke? She must have been up to no good! Etc. This carries over to other areas of life, in business, politics etc and makes it much harder for women to ever be taken seriously. Hello, fully sex-segregated society, goodbye public life for women."
946,e8lgf23,"&gt;I wasn't talking about the ""muslim"" men/women of the west.

Neither was i. 

&gt;A woman who obeys her husband and fulfills her duties as a responsible female deserves a cushy life. That should be a perk of being faithful, loyal, and respectful to the person who provides resources to the family.

You assume they obey their husband. Most of the time they lack fulfilling those duties. They cheat on their husbands and severe punishments don't prevent that. Most muslim women are utterly miserable. Being cohabited with them is by definition stressful and misery. There is no benefit to being with a woman. Being single gives you much greater benefit. 

You're just a slave to the islamic state and to your woman (because you work and provide everything). MGTOW is freedom. It turns its back on gynocentric state. 

&gt;Nope, feminists use ""Islamophobia"" as a narrative. Most of the ""muslim feminists"" I've seen still even refuse to take of their veils. Again, you're talking about western females here anyways, so this point is irrelevant. Have you been anywhere outside of the west? I've heard that eastern European women are MUCH better than the ones we have here.

Nope. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-45181505 Not western women.  Also https://www.khaleejtimes.com/editorials-columns/arab-women-wake-up-to-metoo-movement

AWALT. You can't change female nature. You can try and suppress it. You can put the fear of god into them. It still doesn't change the fact that you'll still be a willing slave and she'll derive much benefit. It's laughable if you think her staying at home and cleaning. A bit of sex. Is a good trade off for slaving yourself. 

You see muslim men are the most manipulated by women because they are reactive in the sense that they adhere a woman must obeys. But women can be chameleons. They can appear to obey. But they still derive all the benefits by playing nice. Meanwhile you're still a willing slave. And they genuinely despise their men. 

&gt;Would love a source on this. 

https://www.news18.com/news/india/dalit-man-beaten-to-death-over-affair-with-muslim-woman-in-barmer-1822459.html

&gt;I think they quickly recognized female nature and took steps in an effort to correct it, if anything. I see it like a forest fire, if you don't stop it spreading quickly it will just get worse and worse, but if you contain it, you can control it and reduce massive damage.

They didn't just sit down and figure women out. It's a outdated medieval ideology. And even then when women were subjected to certain roles. The men are still manipulated because they are willing slaves. They slave their wage for their woman. They must provide for all their kids. Muslim men have less freedoms than western men. They overvalue pussy because now you must marry and commit to a woman in order to indulge in her. Raising the price of pussy. Raising the importance of her sex being worth committing and giving all your resources to. No thanks. Muslims are morons and slaves to the state and to their disingenuous women."
947,e2uy6mf,"Your ""pious Islamic women"" are being oppressed, genetically mutilated, forced into marriages they don't want, abused by their husbands and in-laws, ordered to cook, clean, cover up, and are locked in their houses. Your women are known to be slaves!"
948,dzr31p7,"So saying that Muslim women are slaves to their husbands when u probably know barely anything about the religion is funny? Even if it’s dark funny? I don’t think so

And sorry I’m getting so triggered, I just happen to be Muslim myself. The least u can do is respect my religion, bcoz whether or not u r a heathen, I respect that choice even if I disagree with it."
949,e00tnf3,"Those things aren't alike at all, what a disingenuous argument. Slaves are an unwilling third party. Muslim women are adults capable of free will and they choose to wear it. The fact that you can unironically say ""we've progressed beyond treating people as property"" in defence of a law dictating what adult women can and can't wear is very amusing. "
950,dyw2l9d,"As Trump supporters, we need to push for a reform in Islam. That is, an Islam that does *NOT* follow the Koran. It is possible, though will be VERY hard. 

As Muslim women are basically sex slaves, which leads to the quick reproduction of Muslims and hence Islam. 

This may have a bloody end, I fear."
951,dvjcwak,"First of all, I did indicate that it is not just Islam. But I stand by what I have said that Islam is a great example of a cross section of how a religion becomes law, thereby facilitating abuse and atrocities. 

Islam as a culture is driven by the religion which segregates men and women, allotting them different rights and freedoms, and keeping them from being equal. This is reflected in laws throughout these countries as well as in the abuses that occur against women (and the rationale for such abuses).

There are many documentaries filmed in multiple countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, &amp; etc which display the abuses done in the name of a religion on the rationale that the law protects the enforcement of religious practices and beliefs (not the people).

Islam is not just a religion but an entire political ideology, culture, and lifestyle with regional nuances. Some Muslims are more moderate than others, typically where they have access to and influence from of other nations. 

Isolated bubbles (much like Christian cults) are breeding grounds for rape, incest, child abuse, abuse of power, and religious fanaticism/indoctrination. And in this culture/social climate, women have less rights than men. Period. 

That is more or less a global truth when it comes to Islam. There are more women and children with unprotected rights than there are with equal/legally protected rights due to Islam. Remember, the laws and culture of these countries stem from a religion, meant to protect beliefs and practices, rather than the rights of people. Whatever rights people have are dictated by the religion. 

This is just how it is. And it is true across many countries wherein there are large Islamic populations. Islam is special for how widespread it is. It is low hanging fruit for the point I was making.

When laws come from a religion that segregates genders and allocates them different rights, it creates an environment in which one of the genders is: 
denied equal access to healthcare
denied equal rights to own property, inherit property 
denied equal access to education. 
denied bodily autonomy (rights to your own body) 
denied personhood (objectified like property and treated based on a gender role’s concept of worth)

This is why many Islamic women are Not taken seriously when sexual abuse occurs. They are taught that spousal rape is not considered rape, because a woman’s duty is to let her husband have access to her body whenever he wants. If a Muslim woman is raped, she must have been impious and tempted the man into it via her actions or manner of dress. If a Muslim woman has intercourse outside of marriage, she is considered worthless, “impure,” unwanted/unable to be wed. This is true even if the woman’s virginity was robbed of them due to rape. Women do not always have the freedom to work, get an education, or have a profession because their place is solely in the home. They should only be able to take pride in being a wife, mother, cook, and housekeeper, because for a woman, these things should be the most important. They are limited in how they can live from cradle to death, with many widowed Muslim women at the mercy of their sons for protection/status/income/lodging in old age. 

Do not forget that where women are abused, children are as well. We all know that young girls, under the age of 10 can be married off. We all know that Islam has no minimum age for marriage. But many people do not consider how young boys become the target of sexual frustration of older men, because women are so tightly segregated, and so much emphasis is placed on “properness and decorum” when in the presence of a woman.

The reason I am using Islam as an example, is because it is extremely low hanging fruit. Sure, every religion or culture has women who have child brides, FGM, rape, incest, &amp; etc. at some point in history. Yes, everywhere on earth you can find little girls who die giving birth to children they aren’t old enough to deliver, and etc. But there are few religions and cultures as widespread as Islam which allow for and openly endorse  the kind of patriarchy and abuse of power that leads to these atrocities. Why? Because their laws stem from a religion that does not grant equality across gender or age. The fact that some progressive laws exist, but are rarely enforced or enforceable speaks volumes.

A religious cult in a progressive country will be caught and held accountable because laws are enforceable and women/children are EQUALLY protected under law. The Law exists outside of religions and must reflect the values of the majority of people of diverse cultures and backgrounds. So in short, the laws in progressive countries are based on (in theory) what most people would consider to be just. The laws in Islamic countries are based on what religious leaders and the Qur’an say is just.

A religious cult in a country permissive to the values of that cult, because the values of the country are based on the values of a religion, will rarely ever hold individuals accountable for abusing women and children. 

The things that make a religion seem terrible are often a direct result of a lack of separation of “church and state.” 

It does not stop atrocities from occurring but it prevents them from becoming widespread ideologies. There will always be niche cults full of abusers. But unless Islam can be looked at as only a religion and not the law (or an ideology) it will continue to safely harbor those who commit atrocities.

And what is the punishment for killing an apostasy in almost all nations that are predominantly Muslim? You are making a ridicules argument. 

And you are making that argument very selectively. Here is a list of things that the bible says you should put to death (btw, all of those are things that the Bible says that god demands that Christian people put the offenders to death, not just a list of things some imaginary god might kill you for): 

https://www.thedailybeast.com/all-the-things-the-bible-wants-to-execute-you-for

* Disobeying one’s parents. According to Deuteronomy, if a man disobeys his parents they should take him to the elders of the city, denounce him as a glutton and a drunkard, and then everyone should stone him to death.

* Gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. When the Israelites were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on a Saturday. They brought him to Moses, who was unsure what to do with him. The word came down from on high that the man should be put to death, and the entire congregation stoned him outside the camp. This appears to have been an isolated incident, but just in case avoid gathering firewood or carrying pencils on the Sabbath.

* Sexual relations with your in-laws. The penalty for sleeping with both a mother and her daughter is that all of them should be burned to death. Interestingly, sleeping with your daughter-in-law or stepmother incurs the more ambiguous punishment of you being put to death. Sex with your aunt or sister invokes social alienation, but not the death penalty.

* Attending Hogwarts. According to Leviticus 20:27 “Any man or woman who is a medium or wizard shall be put to death.” Stoning is the specified method of execution. Sorry, Harry.

* Kidnapping. Anyone who kidnaps someone should be put to death, regardless of whether or not the victim is still in their possession. Bad news for those involved in human trafficking and espionage.

* Taking the Lord’s name in vain. Anyone—whether they are a local or an under-informed foreigner—can be stoned to death for taking the Lord’s name in vain. Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit continues to be a serious sin in the New Testament: it is described in the gospel of Matthew as the only sin that will not be forgiven.

* All kinds of extramarital sex. Sex with animals, adultery, sex with a woman who is betrothed to someone else, and sex with someone while betrothed to someone else all warrant the death penalty. For men, sex with slaves was probably the safest option, but for women the situation was always dire. If a woman is found not to be a virgin on her wedding night, then the entire town gathers at the entrance to her father’s house and stones her to death.

* Worshipping other gods. If there’s one theme that emerges from reading the Hebrew Bible, it’s that God doesn’t like it when you worship other gods. When the whole people cheat, he allows them to be conquered by a foreign land. But when you do it solo you’re looking at the death penalty.

* These regulations are just those warranting the capital punishment. There are many others—sporting tattoos, wearing blended fabrics, and cooking steak in butter—that are also forbidden, but carry lesser penalties.

So, I assume you think the same about Christians now?

&gt; Edit: and yes, obviously people will ignore the rules they dont like, im not saying all muslims follow strict fundamnetalist interpretations. But that doesnt mean none of them do, nor does it mean his family couldnt have. 

Than why are you not phrasing it like that, for example with ""according to Quaran / doctrine a Muslim has to do X"" instead of making it a general argument by saying that ""a Muslim has to do X"". "

954,dszt8og,"&gt;  Sahih al-Bukhari 5285

About this hadith....Here's the full picture, and not your misrepresentation of it.


&gt;There are some scholars who say it’s allowed to marry a Christian and a Jew, and others prohibit it. Let’s discuss those who don’t allow it and look at their reasons why. Allah said, “And do not marry Al-Mushrikat (idolatresses, etc.) till they believe (worship Allah Alone).2:221.Then among the polytheists Allah mentioned the people of the scripture. He said:, “Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibat [all kinds of Halal (lawful) foods, which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, etc., milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits, etc.). The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals, etc.) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time, when you have given their due Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage)[5:5].


&gt;**Imam Ash-Shafa’I said at first all the polytheists were included then the verse allowing marriage and food from the people of book was sent down. There are some people who believe the verse in Al-Baqarah abrogated the ruling for marrying the People of the Scripture in Al-Ma’idah. Therefore they don’t allow this marriage. There is a narration collected in Sahih Al-Bukhari Whenever Ibn `Umar was asked about marrying a Christian lady or a Jewess, he would say: “Allah has made it unlawful for the believers to marry ladies who ascribe partners in worship to Allah, and I do not know of a greater thing, as regards to ascribing partners in worship, etc. to Allah, than that a lady should say that Jesus is her Lord although he is just one of Allah’s slaves.”[5285]. An-Nahas in his tafsir rejected this saying it went against the consensus of the sahabah and Taabee’een. Moreover, it’s not possible that the verse in Al-Baqarah abrogated the verse in Al-Ma’idah; as Al-Baqarah was revealed in Madinah before Al-Ma’idah. The majority of the scholars hold the view that the verse in Al-Baqarah is general and the one in Al-Ma’idah is specific.**

&gt;Now that the argument about the verse is out of the way  let’s mention some other scholars who considered marrying a Jew or a Christian disliked. Atta ibn Rab’ah considered that verse was revealed at a time when the Muslim women were few. Ibn Umar disliked Muslims marrying Jews and Christians. Huthayfah ibn Al-Yaman married a Jew and Ibn Umar wrote him a letter requesting him to leave her, so Huthayfah wrote back asking him was it Haraam and Ibn Umar replied, “No”. Ibn Umar used to say the Muslim women are large in number, and I’m afraid the men will leave off single Muslim women, for the People of the Scripture. Among the four schools of Jurists, we find that Muhashi Al-Hanafi said, “ It’s allowed to marry from the people of the book, but it’s still better to avoid it and their food ;unless it’s necessary.” Ibn Habib Al-Malikey said: “Although we are allowed marrying Jews and Christians it’s burdensome.” Imam Ash-Shafa’I said: “I prefer that Muslim men don’t marry women from the people of the Book.”  Now, if they are Christians who follow the Pslams of David, or the Scripture of Seth and Ibrahim then it’s not allowed to marry them, as these aren’t considered Holy books, but only admonitions.

955,dt0s58p,"I never once stated that they were slaves, but were subordinate to men. Not having the right to vote while men do means that they were subordinate, lower in rank or position. While many women did not want the right to vote, that gives no credit to your argument. Many Muslim women are completely okay with the treatment they receive, but does that mean that they are not oppressed, no, of course they are. Now that women have the right to vote, do you believe that they would be fine with giving it up? I also question the validity of these opinion polls as it would be very easy to make them biased. Many poor people do not consider themselves oppressed, but this does not mean that they are not. Many women in that time did want the right to vote, so discrediting my claim by stating it lacks historical context, when I do understand the historical context of the time in question, is non-sensical as it was still a commonly held belief."
956,dqc6ygw,"Yes, though the extent to which varies by location and time. 

Christians were dhimmi, along with all other non-Muslims and considered inferior. Under Islamic law (Sharia) dhimmi have to pay extra taxes, such as jizya, and were forbidden from proselytizing or preaching publicly at risk of their own execution. At some points entire Christian communities would be held hostage for ransom in order to fund larger military campaigns and in some places Christians would be forbidden to own weapons. Christians were sometimes taken as slaves, especially if they failed to pay jizya. In some societies the testimony of a Christian was considered invalid and the word of a Muslim was almost always considered to be more truthful. In many Muslim communities Muslim men are permitted to marry non-Muslim women but Muslim women are/were forbidden to marry non-Muslim men. The Pact of Umar in the Eight Century forbade Christians from displaying the Crucifix on churches. 

Later there were outright massacres of Christians on large scales, but this happened more commonly after the First Crusade (1096AD). "
957,dqkmzkt,"There may not be a quran verse spelling out that non-muslim women are not to be considered human, but the quran allows muslim men to take non-muslim women as sex slaves (meaning that they don't need to marry them). Keeping a sex slave permanently nowadays is a little difficult, but muslim men have been pretty successful in making non-muslim women their sex slaves temporarily by raping them.

Muslim men who rape non-muslim women do it because they believe it's their right to take these women as their posession (even if temporarily) because the quran allows them to do it and not be blamed for it.

Other than with a non-muslim woman of their ""posession"", muslim men are forbidden from having sex outside of marriage and the ""poor things"" are allowed to have four wives (definitely not enough, right?).

(Quran 23:1-6)

The Believers must (eventually) win through—those who humble themselves in their prayers; who avoid vain talk; who are active in deeds of charity; who abstain from sex, except with those joined to them in the marriage bond, or (the captives) whom their right hands possess for (in their case) they are free from blame. 

If it's ok to kill infidels of any gender why would muslims respect female infidels who, according to them, are ""whores"" because of the way they dress and act rather than being ""modest""?

The quran makes it clear that muslims are superior and infidels/disbelievers are worth nothing.

Muslims are the TRUE supremacists. The quran tells them they are the ""best of mankind"" while disbelievers"" are the ""worst of the creatures""

(Quran 3:110)

You (muslims) are the best of Peoples ever evolved from (Mankind and) for Mankind enjoining what is right, preventing what is wrong, and believing in Allah; And if only the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) had faith, it would be best for them: Among them are some who have faith, but most of them are those who exceed the bound with evil in their minds.

(Quran 98:6)

Surely those who disbelieve (after the Clear Evidence has come to them) – from among the People of the Book (Jews &amp; Christians) and from among the polytheists – will be in the fire of Hell (a seed of which they bear in their hearts), abiding therein. They are the worst of creatures.

960,dnfub1o,"Just an indication of the growing power of Islam in the western world. People in positions of power and government can talk about this vulgarity in public and are only condemned when their content is directly insulting to a set demographic, otherwise they're both allowed and encouraged to spread their hateful faith.

S.N.

&gt; We’ve been fighting for Muslim women’s rights and something like this really sets us back. 

What rights, Muslim women are inherently slaves. Considering them as anything but submissive servants who exist only to please their Muslim ~~owners~~ ~~husbands~~ men is an affront to feminism. Islam is not feminist, just accept that already."
961,dl5f0dt,"What is it with this reddit narrative that all muslim women are basically slaves? If the daughter of a punk rocker decides to get earrings and a nose ring is she being forced to do it?

Hell, most of the muslim women I went to elementary school or highschool with didn't wear head coverings. I withdrew myself from highschool to go work for my dad. When I went back to adult highschool only like the new immigrants wore head coverings.

If a woman wants to remain modest and not wear a bikini or one piece swimsuit why can't they? Hell, a woman can wear swim trunks alone here, legally. A man can wear a t-shirt and trunks if they want. Even underwear is legal. As long as your genitals are covered."
962,dkfwhwl,"&gt; Just to be clear, this is not the teachings of Islam. Nothing in the Qaran advocates for the repression of women and those who do not believe in what you do.

There are several surahs straight from the Quran that clearly show that Muslim women must be covered when in public.

Quran 24:31

&gt;And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest, and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent, and to draw their veils over their bosoms, and not to reveal their adornment save to their own husbands or fathers or husbands' fathers, or their sons or their husbands' sons, or their brothers or their brothers' sons or sisters' sons, or their women, or their slaves, or male attendants who lack vigour, or children who know naught of women's nakedness. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And turn unto Allah together, O believers, in order that ye may succeed.

33:59

&gt;O Prophet! Tell thy wives and thy daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks close round them (when they go abroad). That will be better, so that they may be recognised and not annoyed. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.

Alternative translation of 33:59

&gt;O Prophet! Say to your wives, your daughters, and the women of the believers that: they should let down upon themselves their jalabib.

What is the meaning of “jalabib”?
&gt;Jalabib جَلاَبِيْبٌ is the plural of jilbabجِلْبَابٌ , which means a loose outer garment. See any Arabic dictionary like Lisanu ’l-‘Arab, Majma‘u ’l-Bahrayn or al-Munjid.

&gt;Al-Munjid, for instance, defines jilbab as “the shirt or a wide dress—القميص أو الثوب الواسع.” While al-Turayhi, in Majma‘u ’l-Bahrayn, defines it as “a wide dress, wider than the scarf and shorter than a robe, that a woman puts upon her head and lets it down on her bosom...”


The hadiths go into more detail, of course. 

It's absolutely clear that observant Muslim women are obliged to refrain from wearing miniskirts. Anyone who claims to obey the Quran but violates these verses is badly mistaken at best.

"
963,did1fon,"According to the annals of Quran (or anals to be precise), Muhammad was a ominsexual camel kin fruity goatfucker transnigger of his time. It is well documented by Gaandour Al Hamid, one the Prophet's sexual companions how the Prophet squandered the monthly allowance given by his uncle to buy black slaves from the markets of Mushreek to have anal sexual orgy with them.

He paid back by getting analed by his uncle. Hence the arse lifting tradition in Islam.

In India, Muslim women are treated like whores and are regularly gang raped by Hindus day in and day out. Hindus usually take turns in raping the children too and wiping their cum with the Quran."
964,dj3mf8z,"I read your history. good to have a rad fem reaching out for RP perspectives.

I noticed one of your comments: ""We are mainly gender critical, anti porn-industry, anti-kink (such as BDSM, DDLG), anti-sex work, etc. ""

Although those are important items and I understand why.... but I;ve often wondered why does feminism overlook higher important items like FGM, female inequality in Islam, female slavery, forced marriages in foreign countries and in first world countries such as UK....why? I mean something like FGM is horrific and barbaric, yet its low on the feminist priorities if at all mentioned. Espeically how muslim women are treated like domestic and sex slaves. Why does feminism ignore it? (at least what we see of feminism)

Also high suicide rate among males, homeless men are the least helped in society, do rad feminists see this as inequality?"
965,dhdwn7j,"No they do because it specifically says in the quaran that rape of infidels is good and encouraged. If they had their way they would  make sex slaves of those women too, so its just rape for now until sharia law takes over in Europe.

The head scarf **is** a symbol of repression.  I don't think it is, it is objectively a symbol of ""you must cover up and not be seen.""  There is a reason that it is being fought against in muslim majority countries, since women cannot be in public without one on, and in the west, Muslims that practice Taqiyya proclaim that its a symbol of women's liberation.  No, it is a symbol of repression, full stop.  Its the PG variant of the yellow star that the Jews had to wear during Nazi Germany's reign of power.  They choose to wear it because they're indoctrinated into believing that they have a choice.  If they take it off, and they get punished, then guess what?  It isn't a choice.  I'd argue the majority of muslim women are treated like broodmares and sex slaves in majority muslim countries.  Just because a kid in the US or UK has the option of taking it off now and then doesn't mean that it has completely done a 180.  

A little yellow star still means anti-semitism in the same was a hijab and a niqab means misogyny."

Scottish people aren't all brilliant engineers.

Regardless, the focal point is that your original comment implied that all Muslim women are being manipulated into wearing a hijab but that’s simply not true. Did you see a Muslim girl clearly not in that situation and decide to go off about a different situation? If so, then you clearly see all members of Islam as related to the topic you brought up. I am not against Islam or Christianity because people interpret and make of it what they want. Odds are someone close to you follows a religion and odds are at some point atrocities have been committed in the name of that religion. If you are consistent with your outrage then you should be vocally condemning them as well. I on the other hand, don’t blame my mother for the crusades."
970,fxyb9of,Ignoring that european muslim women are pressured and often times beaten by their husbands to wear a hijab😎😎
971,fy1ddcm,"Actually a lot of the time, Muslim women are not wearing hijab/niqab for their husband so much as they are for their hundred aunts/uncles and thousand cousins.

Many of these people come from cultures that have giant extended families that still behave like a small village where everyone knows everybody else's business and everyone is very interested in who is f!cking whom.

For women from these cultures, wearing hijab/niqab is a form of virtue signalling to their hundred billion cousins who may or may not be related by blood that they are only doing their husband and not every other male in town.

Whether or not their own husband is forcing them to wear the head veil is irrelevant since most of the gossip within these village sized extended families is done by the *women*, that is - Aunt Mandy sees cousin Sophie not wearing head veil so immediately tells ALL the women of the clan that she is a slut."
972,fy3ijpi,"To clarify, I would ban the face covering altogether and only ban the hijab (which doesn't cover the face) in public schools for the reasons already mentioned.

The hijab is far less restrictive and dehumanising to women and can facilitate better integration into Western society. Whilst I would love to see an Islamic reformation/decline, the faith itself isn't going to disappear anytime soon so compromises have to be made. Some Muslim women are very rigid in their beliefs and to deny them the hijab wouldn't bode well for inter-community relations.

With a ban on the hijab on young children and girls in public schools, as part of a wider secular education, parents will not be able to thrust the hijab onto their children. Yes, there is the issue of older girls being forced to wear the hijab, but with future generations that should hopefully decline (especially as third and fourth generation immigrants are becoming increasingly integrated and liberal). Yes, a husband could force his wife to wear the hijab, but this really comes under the umbrella of domestic abuse and manipulative behaviour (men controlling what their partners wear isn't exclusive to muslim communities), and in such a case I would think it to be a lesser evil for her to be forced into the hijab than the face covering. 

It's really a matter of being pragmatic with the approach, it's a very complex issue for what's only a piece of cloth."
973,fy3mpj4,"The truth is always somewhere in between - it can range from a free wheeling society to another extreme where the consequences can be severe and wide ranging, such as shaming by family and the society.

&gt; In the Indonesian Aceh province, Muslim women are required to wear the hijab[1] and all women are required to do so in Iran.


Should women have a choice to wear ? Absolutely. Should they be shamed for what they wear ? Nope. The trends in USA point to the former, with more people choosing to forego the hijab

&gt; According to a Pew Research Center survey, among the roughly 1 million Muslim women living in the U.S., 43% regularly wear headscarves, while about a half do not cover their hair.[57] In another Pew Research Center poll (2011), 36% of Muslim American women reported wearing hijab whenever they were in public, with an additional 24% saying they wear it most or some of the time, while 40% said they never wore the headcover.[58]"
974,fy3ux87,"So real Islam wasn't practiced by Muhammad? That sounds mighty heretical to me young padawan. It's in one of the billion hadiths so progressive Muslims can say the Prophet might not have truly said it right? 

Edit: Yes it is in fact in multiple hadiths. Here's the argument as put by a Muslim website I found: 
With regard to the Ahaadeeth: 

1 – It was narrated from Safiyyah bint Shaybah that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) used to say: When these words were revealed – “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – they took their izaars (a kind of garment) and tore them from the edges and covered their faces with them. 

Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4481. The following version was narrated by Abu Dawood (4102): 

May Allaah have mercy on the Muhaajir women. When Allaah revealed the words “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)”, they tore the thickest of their aprons (a kind of garment) and covered their faces with them. 

Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

This hadeeth clearly states that what the Sahaabi women mentioned here understood from this verse – “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – was that they were to cover their faces, and that they tore their garments and covered their faces with them, in obedience to the command of Allaah in the verse where He said “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” which meant covering their faces. Thus the fair-minded person will understand that woman’s observing hijab and covering her face in front of men is established in the saheeh Sunnah that explains the Book of Allaah. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) praised those women for hastening to follow the command of Allaah given in His Book. It is known that their understanding of the words “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” as meaning covering the face came from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because he was there and they asked him about everything that they did not understand about their religion. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the Dhikr [reminder and the advice (i.e. the Qur’aan)], that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought”

[al-Nahl 16:44] 

Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari: There is a report of Ibn Abi Haatim via ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Uthmaan ibn Khaytham from Safiyyah that explains that. This report says: We mentioned the women of Quraysh and their virtues in the presence of ‘Aa’ishah and she said: “The women of Quraysh are good, but by Allaah I have never seen any better than the women of the Ansaar, or any who believed the Book of Allaah more strongly or had more faith in the Revelation. When Soorat al-Noor was revealed – “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – their menfolk came to them and recited to them what had been revealed, and there was not one woman among them who did not go to her apron, and the following morning they prayed wrapped up as if there were crows on their heads. It was also narrated clearly in the report of al-Bukhaari narrated above, where we see ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who was so knowledgeable and pious, praising them in this manner and stating that she had never seen any women who believed the Book of Allaah more strongly or had more faith in the Revelation. This clearly indicates that they understood from this verse – “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – that it was obligatory to cover their faces and that this stemmed from their belief in the Book of Allaah and their faith in the Revelation. It also indicates that women’s observing hijab in front of men and covering their faces is an act of belief in the Book of Allaah and faith in the Revelation. It is very strange indeed that some of those who claim to have knowledge say that there is nothing in the Qur’aan or Sunnah that says that women have to cover their faces in front of non-mahram men, even though the Sahaabi women did that in obedience to the command of Allaah in His Book, out of faith in the Revelation, and that this meaning is also firmly entrenched in the Sunnah, as in the report from al-Bukhaari quoted above. This is among the strongest evidence that all Muslim women are obliged to observe hijab.

2 – It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to go out at night to al-Manaasi’ (well known places in the direction of al-Baqee’) to relieve themselves and ‘Umar used to say to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Let your wives be veiled.” But the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do that. Then one night Sawdah bint Zam’ah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), went out at ‘Isha’ time and she was a tall woman. ‘Umar called out to her: “We have recognized you, O Sawdah!” hoping that hijab would be revealed, then Allaah revealed the verse of hijab.

3 – It was narrated from Ibn Shihaab that Anas said: I am the most knowledgeable of people about hijab. Ubayy ibn Ka’b used to ask me about it. When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married Zaynab bint Jahsh, whom he married in Madeenah, he invited the people to a meal after the sun had risen. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sat down and some men sat around him after the people had left, until the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up and walked a while, and I walked with him, until he reached the door of ‘Aa’ishah’s apartment. Then he thought that they had left so he went back and I went back with him, and they were still sitting there. He went back again, and I went with him, until he reached the door of ‘Aa’ishah’s apartment, then he came back and I came back with him, and they had left. Then he drew a curtain between me and him, and the verse of hijab was revealed. 

Al-Bukhaari, 5149; Muslim, 1428. 

4 – It was narrated from ‘Urwah that ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray Fajr and the believing women would attend (the prayer) with him, wrapped in their aprons, then they would go back to their houses and no one would recognize them. 

Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 365; Muslim, 645. 

5 – It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “The riders used to pass by us when we were with the Messenger of Allaah (S) in ihraam, and when they drew near to us we would lower our jilbabs from our heads over our faces, then when they had passed we would uncover them again. 

Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1833; Ibn Maajah, 2935; classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah (4,203) and by al-Albaani in Kitaab Jilbaab al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah. 

6 – It was narrated that Asma’ bint Abi Bakr said: We used to cover our faces in front of men. 

Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah, 4/203; al-Haakim, 1/624. He classed it as saheeh and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. It was also classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Jilbaab al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah. 

7 – It was narrated that ‘Aasim al-Ahwaal said: We used to enter upon Hafsah bint Sireen who had put her jilbab thus and covered her face with it, and we would say to her: May Allaah have mercy on you. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And as for women past childbearing who do not expect wedlock, it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment” [al-Noor 24:60]. And she would say to us: What comes after that? We would say: “But to refrain (i.e. not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them”. And she would say: That is confirming the idea of hijab.

1 – It was narrated from Safiyyah bint Shaybah that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) used to say: When these words were revealed – “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – they took their izaars (a kind of garment) and tore them from the edges and covered their faces with them. 

Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4481. The following version was narrated by Abu Dawood (4102): 

May Allaah have mercy on the Muhaajir women. When Allaah revealed the words “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)”, they tore the thickest of their aprons (a kind of garment) and covered their faces with them. 

Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

This hadeeth clearly states that what the Sahaabi women mentioned here understood from this verse – “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – was that they were to cover their faces, and that they tore their garments and covered their faces with them, in obedience to the command of Allaah in the verse where He said “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” which meant covering their faces. Thus the fair-minded person will understand that woman’s observing hijab and covering her face in front of men is established in the saheeh Sunnah that explains the Book of Allaah. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) praised those women for hastening to follow the command of Allaah given in His Book. It is known that their understanding of the words “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” as meaning covering the face came from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because he was there and they asked him about everything that they did not understand about their religion. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

976,fy5e67v,"the majority of muslim women are forced to wear hijab but it depends on the country and the family. However in some countries you can wear it whenever u want it doesn’t have to be at puberty but the moment u decide to remove people start losing their minds. 
I’ve never been to SA nor Iran but i’m pretty sure everyone’s forced to wear it there but maybe if they have liberal parents they can let them choose when to wear it. As for me my mom forced me to wear it when i hit puberty and i know she would never let me take it off. it’s also very typical of muslim men to call free women “prostitute”"
977,fy7p5sc,"it depends on the city and family, but ""most"" Muslim women are forced to wear the Hijab that's for sure and certain, no one can deny that"
978,fy877yz,"Muslim women are required by islam to wear hijab, but if one doesn't for whatever reason no law should stop her since that's between her and Allah, you can't force someone else to wear hijab.

Most things that Muslims have to do aren't and shouldn't be enforced by laws."
979,fyfznsv,"&gt; And you've got it backwards- according to the Quran, aside from the modesty function, it is INTENDED that the garb make you noticed and recognised as a muslim

No its not , this ruling was given in surah ahzab only , and it has a particular context to it. Non muslims at that time were targeting mohammad , his family and  trying to scandalize his women and slandering them , they were also going after general muslim women. They used to keep watch for muslim women on the streets and upon spotting them , they used to come up to them and start flirting with them and harassing them , and in this manner they were trying to slander their character in the society.

Upon getting caught doing this by muslim men , they used to make excuses such as , "" we thought it was one of our women ,and we wanted to only talk with her "" , "" we thought she was a slave girl "" so the excuses they used to give was that they didnt know that they were muslim women , but in reality they knew full well that they were muslim women and they purposefully filtered them out on the streets to flirt with them and engage them in conversations so that any passerby would get negative perception of muslim women's character and in this way mohammad's follower's women would be put in bad light in the society.

So directions of full hijab/niqab were revealed in this instance , and muslim women were commanded to fully cover themselves so that they be known and recognized as a muslim women. In this way now , no man looking to scandalize muslim women would be able to excuse himself after getting caught harassing/flirting with muslim women with excuses like ""I dint know she was a muslim women , I thought she was one of our women or some slave girl"".
So now that muslim women are dressed in accordance to ahzab's ruling , whenever they go out , they would be fully visible and stand out from non muslim women and no man can now approach them to harass/scandalize her.

Also the ahzab verse after giving the ruling for the dress , mentions that if even after this , those men still not stop doing what they do , then they should be arrested and killed on the spot. This is the whole context of the verses regarding dress for muslim women in surah ahzab , it has nothing to do with the commandments of how to dress for general muslim women of all era.

The commandment for how muslim women should dress is only found in Surah nur verse 31. And no ruling of the garb intending to make muslim women be noticed and recognized is found in that verse."
980,fyk7r4p,"When i hear stories like these I wonder how big a lie the 'Muslim Women are not oppressed, they are Free' narrative is.

If you are a Muslim woman :

1 - cant leave Islam.

2 - cant go out with Hijab

3 - cant go out without male guardians (some countries)

4 - cant get equal share in inheritance

5 - cant talk or mingle with men.

6 - but you are free."
981,fyqels3,where the fuck do you get your info from? muslim women are *not* forced to wear hijabs in the vast majority of cases. women *choose* to wear one. isis taking them off has literally nothing to do with why they wear a hijab. people who think women are forced to wear hijabs are ignorant beyond words. it’s a choice made by the woman. if you think and isis liberation video is an accurate representation of why women wear hijabs you’re a fucking moron.

The second you question it, you're a neo Nazi in their books. It's like the modern heretic. I pointed out that many Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab. They called me a bigot. Bunch of idiots.

However, while understanding that I am a girl born into western society, I've also gone back to my parent's home country. My experience and 'source' also draws from what I've seen there, in a third-world, non-western country. Just because you have yet to meet a women forced to wear a hijab, doesn't mean I haven't.
 You're correct, many muslim women are more then what they choose to, or not to wear. However, since that was the topic of this post, that is what I focused on.
You speak of arrogance yet talk as if you are the one who know's it all, weighing your experiences above mine, as if just because every muslim women you've met is happy to wear a hijab means all muslim women are."
986,fyvw5pl,"The banning of hijab or its removal is taking place worldwide a country at a time. They do it because they think “it’s unnecessary and not a sign of free society.” The hypocrisy and ignorance in their thinking is through the roof (freedom shouldn’t force you to comply by a symbol of any society- it should enable you to dress however you want- even if it’s based on religious guidelines). They think Muslim women are oppressed and don’t make the choice for hijab on their own. If Muslim women are so oppressed as they claim they are, then why do they think it’s okay to force Muslim women to comply by their so called “standards of a free society”? Isn’t that force a form of oppression in of itself? There is no logic to it- it’s all Islamophobic nonsense disguised as false liberation."
987,fyzhd5o,"Things aren’t only black and white and this is a very complex topic. There are a lot of factors that go into it and why a lot of middle eastern countries haven’t become more open. Not only that but due to western invasion a lot of open middle eastern counties like Afghanistan have become very strict and religious. However, we are not talking about those countries we are talking about Germany. 

Yes you are right, hijab, burqas etc are not in the Quran and this has been a topic of discussion in many muslim communities. With that being said there are a lot of things in Christianity that isn’t in the Bible yet Christins practice it anyway and that’s on them to decide if they want to do it or not. It’s not for the government to impose such rules. If you say this should be illegal for muslims then  so should head coverings be illegal for strict Christians as well or is the hypocrisy gonna pop out again? 

Trust me I grew up in Saudi Arabia I’m very well educated on this topic and I very well know what it’s like for a government to dictate what you should and shouldn’t wear. Trust me when I say I know what it’s like for your family, the government and religion to tell you what to do and what to wear. Clearly those countries don’t value freedom of speech, or religion. However, Germany is an open country thus if you’re talking about freedom speech or of religion/expression then you shouldn’t be taking away that freedom from those who want to do it of their own free will. 

You’ve never seen a European women cover themselves. Oh so I guess christian women who devote themselves to Christianity and nuns who are covered from head to toe are forcibly doing/ don’t exist. 

Again yes all those factors are true but we are not talking about the Middle East. We are talking about freedom of expression and to practice religion in western countries. It’s a fine line when talking about this because of course a lot of Muslim women are forced to cover up in western countries too, but if you take away the freedom from women who want to do it then you’re taking away freedom of expression and religion period. There should be better ways of helping women who are forced to do it but taking it away from women who want to is still not right. 

The way you talk about this issue is completely ignorant of history not only of religion but western civilization itself. Women were subjected to the same nonsense but saying that christian women who chose to devote themselves to religion are allowed to do so but Muslim women aren’t is ridiculous. You’re basically implying that no women want to do so. Which is again ridiculous. 

A lot of religions harm people in many ways, and Christianity is a major offender to just that. So in that case we should just not allow any sort of freedom of religion. All I’m saying that this is nothing but hypocrisy. When people don’t want to  provide services for gay people that’s okay and not discrimination. When trans people are added to the list of people you can’t discriminate against them that’s taking away someone else’s freedom. When France band burqas but has fashion shows surrounding just that then that’s totally fine. Yet, when women want to express themselves that way then that should be illegal because... checks notes.... islam bad. Stop with the hypocrisy.

Again I can’t be more clear, if we are talking about the history of the niqab and how women are forced to wear them, if we are talking about history or the practices of tyrannical governments in the Middle East then yes I completely agree with you. Same with religion in general, historically speaking it has done more harm than good. Again this isn’t about that this is about the hypocrisy I see in this group so often. This is hypocrisy and nothing more. You can’t say one group is allowed to do it but there other isn’t, just because you said so. That’s not how it works."
988,fz2q0li,"No, it isn’t. Wearing hijab is a choice. Not all Muslim women are hijabis."
989,fz5m8oa,"&gt; You can turn it to the other perspective, and say that it is the right of the majority to convert the Hagia Sofia into a mosque.

But can't you then turn this around again and go back to /u/kingumad8350's point? So if the majority wants to do something motivated by their values or culture or other factor, even if harmful against the minorities' wishes, then it's ok? 

What about having rules on not allowing religious symbols, so that Muslim women are forced not to wear hijab in France? After all, laicite is a fundamental principle that makes the French Republic. That's not only what the majority wants, but it's part of laicite, which is a fundamental integral part of the French state. I wouldn't find that ok, but the reasoning applies.

So i don't know. I think that reasoning requires a bit of nuance.

I'm not talking about the HS here btw. But that only became a Mosque through right of conquest. I don't have problems per se with the HS conversion, but I don't think right of conquest should have a place in Islam today. 


And when you peel the layers that's really where the controversy lies with this. And to be honest, when we talk in majoritarian terms like that, that essentially what it's all about. We are the majority so we have the right of force."

3 – It was narrated from Ibn Shihaab that Anas said: I am the most knowledgeable of people about hijab. Ubayy ibn Ka’b used to ask me about it. When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married Zaynab bint Jahsh, whom he married in Madeenah, he invited the people to a meal after the sun had risen. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sat down and some men sat around him after the people had left, until the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up and walked a while, and I walked with him, until he reached the door of ‘Aa’ishah’s apartment. Then he thought that they had left so he went back and I went back with him, and they were still sitting there. He went back again, and I went with him, until he reached the door of ‘Aa’ishah’s apartment, then he came back and I came back with him, and they had left. Then he drew a curtain between me and him, and the verse of hijab was revealed. 

Al-Bukhaari, 5149; Muslim, 1428. 

4 – It was narrated from ‘Urwah that ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray Fajr and the believing women would attend (the prayer) with him, wrapped in their aprons, then they would go back to their houses and no one would recognize them. 

Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 365; Muslim, 645. 

5 – It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “The riders used to pass by us when we were with the Messenger of Allaah (S) in ihraam, and when they drew near to us we would lower our jilbabs from our heads over our faces, then when they had passed we would uncover them again. 

Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1833; Ibn Maajah, 2935; classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah (4,203) and by al-Albaani in Kitaab Jilbaab al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah. 

6 – It was narrated that Asma’ bint Abi Bakr said: We used to cover our faces in front of men. 

Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah, 4/203; al-Haakim, 1/624. He classed it as saheeh and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. It was also classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Jilbaab al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah. 

7 – It was narrated that ‘Aasim al-Ahwaal said: We used to enter upon Hafsah bint Sireen who had put her jilbab thus and covered her face with it, and we would say to her: May Allaah have mercy on you. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And as for women past childbearing who do not expect wedlock, it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment” [al-Noor 24:60]. And she would say to us: What comes after that? We would say: “But to refrain (i.e. not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them”. And she would say: That is confirming the idea of hijab.

991,fzhjjd9,"There is one important problem: you find women wearing hijab attractive, but would an ex-muslim women want to wear the hijab? Think about the other side. In the long-term, I think its reasonable to assume that a hijab-wearing exmuslim women would want to stop wearing the hijab once she has the chance. Muslim women are fine with wearing the hijab because islam says so, but an exmuslim women wont have any reason to. This is especially true since you say you live in the uk, where there will be no societal pressure to wear the hijab."
992,fzm59v7,"I think it goes both ways in this situation. Yes, they can do more research, but it is also up to the men to let them know what is and isnt allowed.  There are varying degrees of islam, and each family is a little different, like with every other religion. Not all muslim women are forced to wear a hijab. Not all muslim women are made to be servants. Both people in the relationship need to be transparant with eachother.  But hey, if they were, there wouldnt be a show."

1004,ftoh2yj,"As a Hindu man, **I know that Hindu women have substantially more freedom and independence compared to Muslim women.**

This is why Hinduism is infinitely better than Islam, where the Muslim women are treated like dirt, are forced to wear burqa/hijab, are not allowed to go outside the house, and in many cases, might not be allowed to attend college/university or have a job.

**However, it is because of this reason that the Muslim fertility rate is substantially higher than the Hindu fertility rate, leading to a constant rise in the Muslim percentage of India's population. It's because Muslim women are forced to give more childbirths by their husbands.**

# As my post above explains, if the Muslim fertility rate is continuously higher than the Hindu fertility rate, then Hindus will go extinct by 2150.

With economic development, fertility rates fall because women feel empowered and have fewer children as a result of greater independence and careers.

In China and in Europe, fertility rates are as low as 1.6, which will cause massive population declines. **China's population alone might fall from 1.4 billion to 350 million in the next 150 years as a result of the very low fertility rate of 1.6 children / women.**

**Further economic development, industrialization, and urbanization in India will reduce the Hindu fertility rate as Hindus become richer and richer.**

However, the Muslim fertility rate will always be higher than the Hindu fertility rate, because Muslim women are less likely to work and have less independence (as well as the fact that they have a religious obligation to have as many children as possible).

# As my post explains, in order to protect the 5,000 year old Indian civilization, Indian culture, and Indian religion (Hinduism), the Hindu fertility rate has to be constantly higher than the Muslim fertility rate to preserve India's demographics.

# We all want Indian women to be more free, empowered, and independent. Economic development, industrialization, and transitioning to an manufacturing-based economy (like China) will cause the Hindu fertility rate to drop because Hindu women will have lives similar to women in China or Europe.

# However, if Hindu women don't have at least 2.1 children, but if Muslim women have more than 2.1 children, then Hindus will be exterminated and wiped off long-term (civilizationally speaking), resulting in India becoming an Islamic country. This will result in Ghazwa-e-Hind. 

# What do the members of this subreddit think?

# Is there a way to make sure that Hindu families have at least 2.1 children (to make sure that the number of Hindus in the world never decreases and to preserve India's demographics so that India remains 80% + Hindu), while ensuring that Hindu women have the freedom and independence they require?"

I swear, they put a hijab on and they feel like they are so oppressed. Then they go on r/hijabis to go rant and complain and it's so pathetic.

I'm not even joking, women are so easily brainwashed. So many Muslim women are brainwashed feminists. They go to protests to support the right for women to get abortions lol. And they are all crazy about the BLM protests too. They prefer kufr laws over sharia"

And also there is a hadith specifically mentioned the ungratefulness of women. So it's an accurate generalization. Women are usually ungrateful and they love the dunya.

Also, Arabic women were wearing coverings like the burka and niqab before Islam became a popular religion in the Middle East."
1015,fx1xtzx,"Sorry, haven't really been on this account in the last couple of weeks.

I do agree that there's an odd emphasis on Islam's oppression of women when other faiths can be worse, although I do think that there is a reason for this - I think Muslim women are (literally) just much more visible to most people. Regardless of whether the niqab/burka is actually recommended in Islam, I'm not aware of any other faith where the covering of women to the same extent is nearly as prominent. Even the hijab is much more widespread (or at least much more recognizable) than any other kind of religious 'modesty wear' in the places where religious oppression of women would typically be discussed. Add in to the mix stuff like Saudi being the only country in the world where women weren't allowed to drive, and I can start to see where Islam gets its reputation from.

I might have missed it, but I didn't see OP mentioning their own faith anywhere so I half assumed they might be atheist.

I'm not a woman, nor do I live in an area where anything comparable to sharia law applies.

When I talk about gender roles, I mostly mean in terms of the general expectation that a man should be a provider/head of household while a woman should take on more domestic/nurturing roles.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that this is something that relates to inheritance, at least in some part. A son will be given a greater share because of the expectation that they will be responsible for managing the finances of the deceased's household in their absence, and/or the finances of their own household.

And it's more this side of things that I see competence coming into play. There are many families where a daughter would be the best suited to taking over a leadership role following their parents' death. There are many heterosexual couples out there where the man is more comfortable dealing with domestic issues and the woman is more comfortable being the primary breadwinner. If that's an arrangement that works well with their particular skillsets, I don't understand why the opposite would be prescribed if it would result in a less productive outcome.

So if my understanding is correct, and male/female inheritance disparity is due to the different responsibilities prescribed due to gender, then I have to ask why those responsibilities are gender-based anyway. Surely it would make more sense for the parent to give a larger share of the inheritance to the child they considered to be most capable of leading and providing for the family *regardless* of gender?"
1016,fx1y8b6,"&gt; Islam does not have violent elements. The violent elements are fundamental to its essence.

That's a completely baseless claim. I have actual experience interacting with Muslims on a daily basis. You're simply parroting right wing talking points. 

&gt; I hope you can read people well because they can be very nice but if you are not one of them when push comes to show of they may turn out to be different kinds of people than you believe. Do they pray five times a day?

No, they don't pray five times a day. In fact, my fiance likes to drink on weekends. They're just regular people. 60% of American Muslims don't pray daily. They just call themselves Muslims nominally. The same way many people call themselves Christian but don't go to church every Sunday. You're making negative assumptions about people based on their religious background. This is textbook bigotry. How do you not see that?

&gt; And there are a lot of countries with Muslims that we're not band.
So I have no idea why we're still discussing this as if it's a thing. The fact that countries on the list contain Muslims and we're not banned 100% proves that this is a ridiculous argument.

We call it a Muslim ban because Trump himself made it crystal clear in 2016 that he intends to ban Muslims from entering the US. The ban was designed specifically to target a specific religious group, by the president's own words. 

&gt; No not at all. Tell those people whose religion they believe in that their followers are killing people and are irrmen then not to leave without covering their heads. They should appear in public without a man. They can't speak publicly. They can't go to school.

Again, you're describing a fringe minority of Muslims. The majority are just regular people. According to [polls](https://www.npr.org/2011/04/21/135523680/lifting-the-veil-muslim-women-explain-their-choice) only 42% of Muslim women wear hijab. My fiance goes out in shorts, and her family has no problem with it. The majority of Muslim women are just regular people who dress just like women of any other religion. 

&gt; Are those nice people speaking out against that? Because the religion they subscribe to condones all those things. And I have a feeling they do too.

And yes, Muslims absolutely do speak out against oppression of women. You just never hear of them if you only consume right wing media. It's funny how you think that *you* get to dictate what *their* religion condones. The vast majority of Muslim do not condone any of those things. You could quote some Quran passages that condone violence, but violence is also present in the Bible and Torah. That doesn't mean that Christians and Jews condone violence. People usually identify with whatever religion they're born with, and discard its violent aspects. That's how it's always been and that's how it always will be.


You have a very warped view of Muslim people. If you actually go out and talk to them in person, you'll find that they're really not different from you and me. If your entire perception of them comes from the media then it makes sense why you hold these views."

Imagine being a part of those communities and having to face complete expulsion from all of your family and social circles if you ""chose"" to show your [hair.](https://hair.As) Just putting this other there because the narrative in the West that all Muslim women are happy and united on covering their hair is patently false.

1019,fx5h6se,"&gt;Surely Muslim women and non-Muslim women are of the same sex that harassers are targeting right ?

Correct. However First: Abdullah Rushdy as an Islamic scholar can't promote a religious ideology to a group that follows a different religion.

Second: Abdullah Rushdy believes that harassment as an ethical issue has many reasons that can be countered by properly following Islam such as Hijab,""Lowering your gaze""...etc. He believes that these teachings are key elements to shaping a society that rejects harassment and shuns those who do it. Again whether you agree with that or not is a different issue.

In conclusion: He believes following the words of Islam and applying them practically will decrease harassment regardless of religion."

Women are the Inferior Sex 

The rigid laws of Islam have deprived half of the population of their basic human rights. The male is in charge of the female: Koran 4:34, and the subjugated half is led to believe, through Islamic teachings, that the supremacy of the man is the will of Allah, and it has been predestined for women to live as submissive, obedient wives.They are forced to accept that women are inferior to men, that their testimony is equal to only half that of the man, that they should inherit one – half of the male share, that  Allah doesn’t want to see any women unveiled, that she may not conserve with men except her father, or her brother. The proper job and position for women is taking care of home, children and to be a housewife. The majority of Muslim women are brought up with the conviction that it is Allah’s command for them to be under male dominance and their fates are interwoven with that of men.

At the age of 9, based on lunar year (when a girl is actually 8 years and 8 months) she is considered an adult and has to pray, fast and cover herself by hijab and eligible to be married. Mohammad’s favorite wife, Aisha; according to evidence, was 6 when Mohammad met her, and nine when the marriage consummated.

According to Islamic law, woman cannot get custody of her children, even if their father dies. In the case of divorce or death, she surrenders her children to their father and /or his family."
1021,fxedwlr,"&gt;hijabs and burkas 

I'm not sure if you are familiar with the different muslim garments but there is a difference. A Burka is one of those complete coverings where you can't see anything. A hijab is just a head scarf, worn to cover the hair. In my personal opinion, the legal or socially required Burka, Niqab, and maybe the Chador (the coverings covering the entire body) have to go, but it's not like all Muslim women are forced to wear those, only Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, as well as some of Egypt and Iraq, are those worn. Also I did see a Muslim woman post on Reddit that a body covering can protect from the heat or there could be other reasons to wear one but it should not be required, legally or culturally. 

In other Middle Eastern countries and in the West, al-Amiras, Hijabs, or no head covering at all are worn. The first two mainly cover the hair are traditionally are to prevent from the male gaze and so can only be taken off in the presence of only females. While that is definitely bad, many choose to wear them. Now for some, they could be brainwashed into believing the need for them, but other Muslim woman, especially in the West where they are less often required, wear them as a symbol of their religion; just like Jewish men wearing a kippah, Sikhs wearing a turban or scarf, or christians wearing a cross (not a garment but still a worn symbol of the religion that is not required but many chose to wear)(Also I'm not sure exactly about when it is required for Jews or Sikhs to wear their coverings but they are worn by men so it's not like it's designed to oppress woman.)

Soure: muslim garment info from a picture graphic of data, everything else is stuff I've seen online, personally experienced, or my personal opinion so you might want to take it with a grain of salt but this is just my take on the issue."
1022,fxegp2r,"&gt;Similarly, the hijab's creation is deeply sexist and offensive, ergo, even if Muslim women wear it as ""proud heritage""

Offensive to whome? Conservative Americans? Lol. A lot of women in muslim Majority countries wear it, a lot of them don't. It's their fucking choice.  And they don't consider it as proud heritage but modest.

1023,fxeh1lp,"Black people were the victims in case of what you're saying. If they find it offensive it's understandable. In the case of hijab muslim women are the ""victims"" , you finding it offensive is irrelevant. Like I said if most black people are okay with something which literally is a reminder of their slave past then it's okay. Of most balck people choose to fly the confederate falg the n it's okay. Most muslim women unlike black people are okay with hijab but are not okay with someone forcing them to wear it."

It all depends on the country's laws, basically. It doesn't say that Muslim women aren't allowed to do this and that in the quran. Wear a hijab or not, we don't care. But Saudi Arabia is quite strict since most of the people there are Muslims, unlike my country; majority are Muslims, but there are Christians, Hindus and Buddhists."
1027,frezvy2,"These polls can be deceiving and misleading, at first glance, most of us will immediately think that Muslim women are being oppressed and forced to wear Hijab by their husbands/fathers. However this might not be the case, the Islamic perspective of God commands follows that once there’s an instruction set by God, Muslims should have no choice but to follow. In that respect, one (a Muslim) could argue that it isn’t a matter of “personal” choice no more.

33:36 Quran:
“It is not befitting for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error”

That said, I still do believe that sadly there’s a lot of oppression in the name of religion in many countries today."
1028,frqoxe7,"The real nonsense is claiming that Muslim women are obligated to cover their hair when the Quran states none of that. 

The Quran is the word of God and the Hadith are the words of Muhammed according to 8-12 generations after Muhammed's demise. The Hadith is a human collection. The Quran is the word of God. The Sunnah elaborates and shows how Muslims pray, not the Hadith. The Hadith cannot contradict the Quran. The Quran states for women to cover their bosoms with the extension of their hijab because the hijab was already an attire used for 3 thousand years in Arab culture. What is worn on a woman's head shall be extended over their chest, not a woman shall wear a hijab to cover her head. You have the conditionals backwards. 

The Hadith is the human effort to recollect. The Quran is the word of God. 

The value of the Hadith is in the expounding of the word of God, not the invention of additional holy injunctions. Eid Mubarak."
1029,fs21t7z,"&gt;I support sports hijab mainly because a couple of decades back, religious zealots like you wouldn't have let women enter a sports venue let alone play in it. I see this as a step in the right direction.

My own sister and cousins, doesn't wear it when they don't want to, like when she went for her dance program or annual day, they wear it when they want to, which they love to wear almost the rest of the time, but bigots like you will see them as forced and brainwashed, nothing new at all.

I feel sorry for you that those women don't live their life like you tell them to, and have a choice of their own other than yours, it might be tough.

I'm way more than happy that Muslim women are in sports and every other sector and are rising as it is, with Hijab or not, I'm proud."

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

end of story"
1031,fs40ltm,"So, the word ""hijab"" basically means ""dressing modestly"". The headscarf can be part of a woman's hijab, but the headscarf itself is not ""the"" hijab. Different groups of Muslims have different ideas about what exactly is necessary for hijab.

Generally, the point of hijab is to be modest in public. Muslim women are not usually expected to wear a headscarf all the time when not in public, especially if they are alone, with their husband, or with certain other groups of people such as some extended family members or other Muslim women."
1032,fsckn51,"Hijab as a concept is a type of barrier, and the Quran provides details for men and women on how to observe it. For women, hijab involves dressing modestly, covering the hair and chest as instructed per the Quran, and behaving modestly with our actions as well. For men they are instructed to lower their gaze and cover their awrah which is everything from the navel to the knee or ankle. I like to differentiate headscarf and hijab sometimes because the concept of hijab has more breadth and depth than people realize. 

EDIT: I want to add that some examples of hijab in action would look like men averting eye contact when speaking with a woman, men refusing to shake hands with women and vice a versa. The awrah (everything meant to be covered) for a women is everything of her body except for the face, hands, and feet (though some schools of thought say it is part of her awrah), though you may see women opting to wear niqab (the face veil) or gloves for a higher level of modesty. This isn’t a religious obligation but a personal choice and there are accounts via hadith which support that niqab was worn by women in the time of the Prophet SAW

“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess, or those male attendants having no physical desire, or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women. And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment. And turn to Allah in repentance, all of you, O believers, that you might succeed.” Quran 24:30-31

“O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks close round them (when they go abroad). That will be better, so that they may be recognised and not annoyed. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.” Quran 33:59

At the time women wore a headscarf but had it flowing behind them, so this verse instructs women to draw their veils over the chests, and affirms that the headscarf is religiously obligated. It’s also a reason why many Muslim women are wary of showing their necks, and often the headscarf/hijab is worn draped over the chest rather than say as a turban just meant to cover the hair"
1033,fswaa5p,"The taboo of banging a woman with a hijab that non-Muslims have. Islamophobic Westerners think that literally all Muslim women are like these sexually repressed, passive beings that don’t desire getting dicked down and doing nasty shit in bed like pretty much every other straight woman on the planet."
1034,ft91hwg,"Islam says that we should be kind and merciful to our parents, but our own safety comes above everything. We're not told to set ourselves on fire to keep our parents or anyone warm.

You can forgive him (if you're ready) that doesn't mean you have to be in the same house or room as him. In fact since he's broken the boundaries of a mahram, I doubt if he'd even be allowed near you the same way a mahram would. 

For example normally Muslim women are allowed to be without hijab in front of other women, but NOT if the other woman is known for being untrustworthy (like if they habitually describe other women's bodies to nonmahram men, or if they're attracted to other women). Similarly if your father has a history of not protecting your modesty or your mind, emotion, body etc, it's very doubtful that the rules for mahram would apply for him. You need to talk to someone qualified to make sure you're actually allowed to let him live with you again under these circumstances.

You absolutely don't need to force yourself to let him back into the household. At most, tell him you forgave him and say that if he truly cares about you and the family he should keep his distance instead of harassing you over phone calls.

You shouldn't feel any guilt at all in this, you didn't allow the abuse you're not going to be denied heaven for wanting to be safe from your fathers STILL ONGOING abuse. I can't believe you have to ask :( have you talked to anyone, therapist counselor etc about this?

Edit: also, legally, have you considered getting a restraining order against him?"
1035,ft9915p,"Men also hide objects of beauty and value when they are insecure that others can possess it. As per Qur'an, Muslim women are not asked to cover up around those who lack ""shame of sex"". The entire function of the veil is to inhibit women's ability to evoke sexual thoughts in men. 

Hijab is completely in sync with how men treat objects of beauty they are insecure about."
1036,fksglwn,"Just remember my brother, marriage is very very long term. First 4-6 months to even maybe a year doesn’t even mean anything....everyone’s high off LUST brother. Arab girls are very spoiled, more spoiled than American girls. That’s why they’re kinda ready to be married and settled down so fast. The Thing is they’re very needy, they’re expecting a lot of support financially. Their Muslim daddies are always power tripping and acting like their blood is made from gold. Even though they will be beautiful and they will cook, clean...they will cut your throat when they’re not happy. 


Now with them being Muslim, you have to understand that adds more fire. Just because they’re Muslim you know doesn’t mean anything. In fact it can make things worse. You’re dealing with hypocrites. They will claim they don’t live for the dunya, and how islam is about peace, yada yada, but they will go crazy if you’re not giving them what they want, and if they find out you’re not muslim! They will feel guilty, because they’re full of ego. Because they won’t care about you going to hell...they will care about themselves going to hellfire for making haram for marrying a Kafir. And also for failing their father and mother for marrying a ex Muslim. 


Now let me be clear, if she’s ok with you being ex Muslim brother, go for it. Even if she’s spoiled or whatever. I don’t know what’s in her heart but I’ve been in these situations plenty of times. If they haven’t been to America they will assume you live in a mansion and money grows from the bushes in your back yard. 

But you cannot hide your identity. Unless you’re ok with waking up for fajr, acting like you make wudu, acting like your fasting. Avoiding certain haram things that u do an that make u happy. You see My wife is agnostic I am a hiding ex Muslim, we told my family she’s a convert and they still are very skeptical about her. She even wore hijab and acted like she was praying all the time an they still were kinda skeptical. I’m sure it’d be easy for you to hide it because you’ve been a Muslim in past for long time. But you mentally loose your mind and you will be in such extreme toxic relationship with this religion. 


Problem is even if she’s not that religious, Islam is still in her identity. These people buy houses on interest, but judge you because you didn’t go to jummah or your pants are dragging to low. 



My wife is Japanese and she was foriegn exchange student, I’m 28 and never ever ever thought I’d marry anyone. But she changed my life. I told her everything and she just understood, never judged and did everything she could to take me out of the shithole I was in. My situation still isn’t perfect and it sucks hiding your identity but it’s so much nicer living in a town away from my family where I don’t have to worry about getting judged 


Ask me anything"
1037,fn6rrnb,"&gt;I'm a Muslim and believe me bro, the so called ""Muslim"" women are no different from western women. That shit is all in the past :/

in the uk the ones who are the slutties don't wear a hijab at all

then it is the ""hijab hoes""

girls in niqab are shy af"
1038,fnqz45i,"Ohh of course! 

I forgot to mention that as I studied more about hijab, I felt more confident in my choice to wear it. If someone were to ask me why do you wear hijab? What’s the purpose of hijab? Why Muslim women are required to cover and not men? Anything like this, I would be happy to tell them and be able to cite sources within the Quran and Hadith as well as expand upon the subject with some insights regarding its differences and challenges across cultures, the controversies around it, etc. Not that I think it’s necessary (you don’t have to answer to anyone tbh) but it certainly helps to feel totally assured in my decision, even when I know I might look strange or out of place to others, I’ve done my due diligence in making sure I understand my choice, so its foundation is firm which gives me confidence"
1039,fnrp63y,"I made an account just to add my two cents haha. I'm studying Islamic religious disciplines at a high school level so I know about the reasoning behind the hijab, at least. One thing you should know abt Islamic law (when it's executed properly) is that it follows logic. And formulating rules MUST be based on evidence from Quran and Hadith. So when an islamic scholar says Muslim women must wear the hijab, they also back it up with evidence:

""And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests..""(Nur: 31)

Notice how it simply says 'wrap a portion of their headcovers over their chest'? That's basically what a hijab is. That means a Muslim woman who's practicing only needs to wear the hijab–face and hands don't need to be covered. 
So what about people who cover their faces etc? Two things: 
1) an increased sense of religiousity– Muslim women want to not just cover the bare minimum, but be more modest and humble before God, so they cover their faces (not eyes) as well

2) Culture and religion getting mixed up, and people who've never opened the Quran forcing their views onto women. Regrettably, a lot of Muslim women are in this boat because the idiots in charge of the country seems to forget this particular gem from the Quran:

""There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion "" (Baqarah:256)

One last thing: Muslim men are also supposed to dress modestly and lower their gaze but that's another story lol 

tl;dr : Hijab (or, covering head, chest and body) is actually the only thing muslim women have to wear according to Allah. The rest are just add ons by culture, modesty and assholes"
1040,fo6u6nq,"&gt;Allah didn't create woman to be leaders and independent citizens.

Exactly and if you leave wearing the hijab up to them,  do you think they will wear it? When have women ever been known to make good decisions? They must be led by example and not handed over complete  'independence' because even if the right choice was staring them in the face they still wouldn't take it. 

&gt;Once accustomed to a Wali-less life - most of them turns into a arrogant overgrown child for life. 

And then they wonder ""where are all the good men gone?"" Far gone from you. I tell you that. Honestly, if Muslim women are going to accept these Western ideals of Feminism and bring into Islam, then expect the same results as Western women - most of them end up divorced for a life time because of their ungratefulness towards their men and when they realise they made the wrong choices, it's too late because there chances of getting a husband completely goes away when they turn old and hit the wall. 

&gt;why even try ? go MGTOW. A feminist or secular educated Hijabi will always struggle with her subservient nature.

Exactly. It's better to stay single than settle for a mediocre relationship. The purpose of marriage in deen was never to settle for a woman who is arrogant and has the potential to take you even farther away from the deen. It just wasn't and in such situation, it's far better for your imaan and Islam to stay single than marry someone like this. Not to mention the serious amounts of harm you subject yourself in the divorce system. If it goes that far. Men should seriously not be afraid to be single because where society is heading right now, a lot of men would honestly be far better off."
1041,foeovqq,"Probably because this sub is overrun by Muslims and Muslim sympathizers. They did it covertly too (without informing me). Perhaps hoping I wouldn't notice. Anyway, I've put it up in [my own sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/GenuineMGTOW/comments/g71xpm/happy_fasting_whether_you_like_it_or_not_to_all/). It needs to be said. 

For all the far lefties reading this, know that *millions* of Muslim *women* are probably being pressured/forced to thirst and starve when they don't want to. Even more so being stuck at home and under close watchful eyes of their husbands, brothers etc. You care so much about the hijab, what about oppression from fasting in Ramadan? Think about that."
1042,folks70,"&gt; one I'm childfree and I will never kids. most religions tend to frown on the childfree lifeatyle. 

No problem. It's not mandatory sister, but it's looked up upon. No worries here. It's a Sunnah, meaning it's looked upon but again, not mandatory. An issue here is sexual impurity. You may know that in Islam, sexual impiety like sex outside marriage, masturbation, homosexuality, are all frowned upon, being haram acts. This is to remove materialistic desires sister, that is all.

&gt; I love fitness. I love running and weightlifting and Zumba (want to become an instructor even if I never use it) and I could never give it up. Outside of my medications my fitness keeps me sane. I don't know is Muslim women are allowed to do that 

Sister are you serious!? The Prophet, peace and blessings upon him **encouraged** exercise. I do calisthenics and I know many Muslim women who do it to. The Prophet (pbuh) highly recommended swimming, archery, horseback riding, wrestling, and correct me if I'm wrong, sword fighting. The only issue here is, again sexuality. Remember your piety. You are better than that, more respected than that.

&gt; Modesty, I like wearing dresses and leggings and looking cute. I'm not sure I could wear hijab, esp at the gym. I'm proud of my body. Is it wrong I want to show it off? 

Depending on your Madhab or School of thought, this is a matter of dispute. As long as you are not emphasizing sexuality and are being modest, lowering your gaze, etc., you should be fine. Don't think too much about the Wahhabis but don't get too Liberal.

&gt; My mom who I live with mom is ok with me being religious bit. as I said ok I think Islam is too foreign and she said she would be embarrassed to be seen with me if I wore a hijab. 

The hijab is a sign of strength. Dont be afraid. It is what is best for you. You shouldn't be embarrassed about it, look at all the other converts (I'm an ex-atheist too, but again, Im male). Your mom needs to understand that this is your choice and she shouldn't have a right to shove any ideology down your throat, without you being willing.

&gt; This may sound I'm afraid of looking like a hypocrite. I was an outspoken athiest for so long and made friends in the community. I'm kinda afraid of losing that.  

 *“And if you turn away, He will replace you with another people; then they will not be the likes of you""*

This beautiful aya from the Quran sums it up, really. Losing friends is hard-but they **aren't true friends if their not willing to man up and accept that you made a decision.** I'm trying my best not to hurt your relationships sister, but these people have to understand that it is your choice not theirs. If they're willing to sacrifice friendship for their beliefs than that is not friendship.

&gt;  Even though now it's been about 3-5 to ears since I was involved in the community I made myself look like a crazy fool. I tired finding Facebook groups but we had disturbing things some weren't in English and some banned me after seeing my affiliation with the Satanic temple before letting me explain. Idk any thoughts 

I don't understand-can you elaborate? If any Muslim has treated you unfairly, know, they do not represent the true religion of Islam. Prayer isn't hard, trust me. It will change your life.

And Allah knows best."
1043,fophwg4,"Families police their daughters more. They're not allowed to go out, while the sons are allowed out. They have to protect the ""honour"" of the parents while many Muslim families do not care if their son is sleeping around with non-Muslim women. They have to wear the hijab as a symbol of their religion, while the men don't. Often times, Muslim women are entirely dependent on their family so they can't leave and be free. If you're dependent on your family, then you have to keep up the appearance of religiosity. It's just harder to leave Islam and be independent if you're a Muslim woman. Ex Muslim men usually are more independent (especially financially) from their family, so if their family disowns them for not living a religious lifestyle, they'll mostly be fine."
1044,fp0ykuu,"I like to compare the hijab to the bra. I wear a bra every time I leave my house. I don't wear it because its comfortable, or warm, or like the way it looks, I wear it because I don't want random people (both men and women) looking at my nipples and loose bouncing breasts. Nobody forces me to wear one, I won't go to jail if I don't wear one. 

Breasts are extremely sexualized in western culture, and it is a social norm to wear a bra. If I didn't, it might make my boyfriend uncomfortable if I'm hanging out with his friends and he notices them staring. It might make it difficult to work with my senior clients where my chest is directly in their face. So, I am socialized to wear a bra in the same way most Muslim women are socialized to wear a hijab. Their mothers will sit them down and tell them that they need to wear their hijab out, because men look at them differently when they don't wear it, just like my mother did when I was developing breasts. Most husbands and fathers don't need to ""force"" the women in their lives to wear a hijab, just like the men in my life haven't forced me to wear a bra. 

Now, are bras or hijabs oppressive? Maybe. They can be, particularly in countries where it is illegal to go without - however I argue that the hijab isn't the root of the problem but the demonization of female sexuality. But even if there was a feminist revolution to get rid of bras I would still wear mine because many men WILL stare if I don't. And I don't want to be sexualized when I get my groceries. And I sure as hell don't want to be forced to remove my bra, just like many people suggest as a way of removing the ""oppression"" of the hijab. I would feel MUCH more oppressed if a bunch of men was trying to force me to never wear a bra again, telling me that its for my own good. I know what I want to wear, and I know the reasons."
1045,fp5l61u,The woman in the picture is actually dressed closer to how Muslim women are 'supposed' to dress than many of those who wear hijab
1046,fpa6p1u,"Honestly speaking I am fed up of BJP. I was a fan of BJP but realised they are as fucked up as Congress just slightly better work wise. The only advantage they had is squandered by their extremely vicious communalism. Even Shakha attending RSS guy is not that vicious in his everyday routine. But over time while being in a relationship with Centre liberal school of thought I even went to attend the Shaheen Bagh protests twice and interacted with a lot of Muslims. The only issue which I encountered was that Muslims are not a single nation. They are a dual nation. The kind of misogyny they practice is unprecedented. Hindus for that matter come nowhere close to what Muslims practice and preach when it comes to gender equality. Women more often than not don't have masjids. I have never seen women in a Moharram procession it is evidently male only. Even on eid overwhelming proportion of people on roads are males. So a society where a women is treated like that you can't expect to have a better fertility rate when the last thing that matters is the physical stress a pregnancy puts on a woman. And don't even ask me about hijab and burqa. I once or twice asked men about why is it necessary. They said aurat ki izzat hi sabse bada gehna hota hai. I was like come on man she's not in Bikini. And the women are fed this from the very start this Burqa and second rate status in Muslim society. So it's not about Hindu Muslim. It is about Muslim Muslim as to how they can educate and give more freedom of choice to women. Not just school education, education and detoxification from these orthodox thought processes then only we will see this fertility rate go down. 
If you don't believe me just Google how many Muslim women are on panel on All India Muslim Personal Law Board which fought against triple Talaq law you'll realise."
1047,fpdo94t,"So a quick disclaimer before some some idiot start bashing Islam in the comments: 

1-a hijab in sharia law is only supposed to cover the whole body exept the face and hands , but throughout the ages , Muslims starting to cover the face and hands , due to thinking that women weren't covering enough , so don't go say that the entire religion about it , a lot of us see the that idea as extreme idea and some of us are even highly against it , and we joke sometimes about saying that women are like tents walking down the streets , the reason for this is that boraque ((the part of hijab that covers the face)) isn't part of original Islam , it's only later been added by Muslims later on

2-women aren't forced to wear hijabs , wearing it is a part of the religion , so any muslim women are fully aware that they need to wear it to follow Islam, that's the path of life that they choose , ask any muslim women((that is not an ex-muslim)) if they are forced to wear the hijab , 98.9% of the time they will answer no . 

3-no muslim country should force women to wear the hijab , it's a religion teaching that any muslim women should follow by their own will , not by forcing them to do it , and I'm against any country that does that , and I see there action as violation to human rights , and should be stopped , and no not every muslim country do this sort of thing , and wearing the hijab is mandatory in 2 countries and one province ((Saudi Arabia , iran , and the province of Aseh in indonisia))

4-islam isn't a cult that oppress women nor treat them like objects , apart from Saudi Arabia and Iran and some parts in pakistan , Muslims are highly against oppressing women by force , and is a clear violation of islamic law , sources:

1048,fpe4zdm,"This whole comment is filled with lies, don’t pretend like non of this happens and it’s only a small fringe of women who are affected because things will never improve. Most Muslim women are forced to wear a hijab and cover up, while it may not be “Wear a hijab or we’ll kill you” in most cases it’s that women who don’t wear it are seen as impure and looked down upon in society.

Also let’s not forget if a women wears a hijab she can’t one day decide to stop wearing it she has to ask her father or husband for permission to take it off plus endure public judgment like oh she took it off because she’s not a good Muslim etc.
Women are extremely scrutinized in Islam and while these choices they make can be out of their own will most of them are forced into by societal pressure and don’t really have a choice.

Literally if you ever see a post of a women who took off her hijab have a look at the comments and you’ll see why most girls don’t really have a choice.
Also don’t try and discredit Ex Muslims saying that it’s only them, there’s a reason why they left."
1049,fpqvrlx,"Comfort does not decide XYZ being right / wrong. Islam also teaches women are deficient in intelligence. Muslim women can be comfortable with it. It does not make it right. 

Hijab is based on false premises (Women's body is ""Sin inducing"" for men), and the distorted reality it perpetuates inhibits healthy mental development of both genders. It fixates the social roles for both genders, normalizes social segregation based on sexual functioning, and inhibits the development of women by corrupting their self perception. 

We will know how *comfortable* Muslim women are wearing it only once we remove the social coercion, victim blaming, gas-lighting, and other intimidation tactics orthodox Muslim societies use to get their way."
1050,fpwpxyk,"In Islam, women wear hijabs to cover themselves, mostly to not show off too much to others (mostly men). There are many styles, but people mostly wear the hijab  that covers all the hair and neck. It is believed that wearing the hijab  will make you closer to God (Allah), so Muslim women are recommended to wear it. However, it is completely optional and women can choose to wear it or not. If you chose not to wear it, it's fine as long as you follow Islamic rules (pray five times a day or read Quran etc.) to be closer to God. Other than that, it is usually recommended to wear one."
1051,fq9wsk8,"A hijab. Something Muslim women (are usually taught and forced from a very young age to wear, so men don’t ‘lust’ over them/modesty) wear. Sometimes, they choose to wear it themselves. In the Middle East, it’s way worse, a lot of women there have no choice but to (not only) cover their heads (but also their entire bodies). It’s pretty sad. I wish a book/tradition/religion/countries wouldn’t tell women they have to cover up. Anything like that is always more toxic in the Middle East. Women (can) get literally get stoned/beaten/killed for not covering up. Not every country in the Middle East is like that, some are way worse than others, doesn’t make it all any better, to be honest. I have NO issue with women who actually choose to wear a headscarf/etc themselves. I’m talking about all the little girls/young women who are forced to do that/forced to ‘participate’ in a religion that has been forced on them when they are very very young. I used to be part of that same religion. Thankfully, I’m from Europe and my family isn’t as bad as other people’s parents. I’m very grateful to (at least) not be in those kinds of families who would kill me for ‘dishonoring’ them but then again, I have never came out to anyone as an ex muslim, so we’ll never know."
1052,fko7zg8,"If anyone calls women ”sluts” it’s Muslim men.

That’s why Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab.

What’s funny about that?"
1053,fkrcn9k,"I have indeed never been to the Middle East, but I have read a lot about Islam, its history, and the impact of Islamic Fundamentalism. You are right, Europe has a fucked history too. In fact, I would argue, the majority of the world does. The west however, has been able to progress. So sorry, but yes, I do believe my ideals are the best, despite probably having some flaws somewhere. Those ideals are egalitarianism and freedom. I take issue with you implying that the hijab protects women, you are blaming the women. You said yourself its the men that act like monsters, so shouldn't we focus on punishing them? No, instead the hijab effects women. It is victim blaming plain and simple. Furthermore, sure in some conditions its a choice, however there are a plethora of countries where women are required to wear the hijab. Finally, you said yourself that Muslim women are not weak or feeble, so why do they need the extra protection from the lust of men?

Don't delude yourself, the hijab is a way to cement the blame regarding lust and sexual violence onto women."
1054,fktdb4x,"
But In islam, you can’t disagree with the sharia punishment. Allah is all knowing, and if he commands one to have their hand cut off for stealing, well you can’t argue, because Quran and Muhammed teach you that it’s a sin to critic the religion and can get you kicked out of Islam. 


If a women doesn’t wear the hijab, she is making a big sin, if she denies the hijab, or she says it’s stupid then she is denying the word of Allah and she can be considered a non Muslim forsure. A lot of women in Islam will manipulate the religion and say it’s a choice. Believe me buddy, it’s not a choice to wear it. It’s very clear in Hadith and in Quran, and the punishment is massive. These poor women, they can’t help but to love their father and mothers religion but little do they know, their religion despises them. 

In Islam your parents cannot even give you a Muslim funeral if you die non Muslim. They are not allowed to even pray for you. Because muahmmed use to pray and he would cry because his mom wasn’t a Muslim and Allah said she will burn in hell. 

These are very basic basic Islamic teachings that are taught to every Muslim. Even the so called moderate Muslim cannot deny this. 

Muslims are taught that missing 5 daily prayers is a grave sin. A lot of Islamic scholars agree that if you skip your 5 daily prayers you leave islam. 
And therefore your parents cannot pray for you or give you a Islamic funeral. 


When I read the Bible for myself, It opened up my eyes clearly. Christianity isn’t perfect, but it never claims to be perfect. It’s clear that mans a sinner and that’s why god loved his children that he sacrificed himself. You see in Islam, Allah constantly tells you in the Quran he doesn’t need your prayers, but how desperately you really need him. You also will not be allowed to see Allah unless you’re privileged enough in a special level of heaven. And there are multiple levels of heaven, and lower levels will not be able to see Allah. But the highest level will, and they will get to enjoy seeing his face....lmao that’s some weird shit if u can imagine that bro. He doesn’t even show himself or would even dare to come to his people. He’s always denying he could never be a man, or come down to earth....Also you can’t really call Allah your father, nor can you say your his child. At least in Christianity Christ was nice. He wasn’t a warlord like Muhammed. He didn’t get any money or gain. He even knew he was going to get crucified and still continued to preach. 

The disciples also were tortured, they knew they were going to die but continued to preach. Muhammed on other hand was allowed to marry 9 wives. Why? Because this was special privilege from Allah because he’s a prophet...He was allowed to marry his adopted sons wife. There’s Hadith how his companions talked about him having strength of 100 men. And how he would see all his 9 wives and have sex an not shower. He also married a 6 year old. And the thing is you’re not allowed to laugh at this as a Muslim! I mean wtf does that info have to do with getting close to your creator ?? There’s Hadith how Aisha washed cum stains off his pants! There’s a Hadith how Solomon had sex with 900 women. Wtf does that have to do with spirituality. And my problem is you can’t argue or make fun or even question it. And moderate Muslims will defend him. 

The scary part is that they defend him, and if you critic it or challenge it, they will say you’re a islamophobe. Even if you nicely say it. In Islam muahmmed taught people to love him more than his wife and kids. My uncles would brag about how much they loved Muhammed more than anything on earth. 

I had great smart Muslim friends, who were doctors and dentists, but when we’d discuss Islam, their IQ would drop. It’s because they know they cannot challenge Islam, or even say “you’re right, this does sound silly” why? Cause it kicks you out of the religion.

Also Muslim women are not allowed to marry non Muslim men. On top of that it’s a major sin to date in Islam.

If a women doesn’t wear the hijab, she is making a big sin, if she denies the hijab, or she says it’s stupid then she is denying the word of Allah and she can be considered a non Muslim forsure. A lot of women in Islam will manipulate the religion and say it’s a choice. Believe me buddy, it’s not a choice to wear it. It’s very clear in Hadith and in Quran, and the punishment is massive. These poor women, they can’t help but to love their father and mothers religion but little do they know, their religion despises them. 

In Islam your parents cannot even give you a Muslim funeral if you die non Muslim. They are not allowed to even pray for you. Because muahmmed use to pray and he would cry because his mom wasn’t a Muslim and Allah said she will burn in hell.

When I read the Bible for myself, It opened up my eyes clearly. Christianity isn’t perfect, but it never claims to be perfect. It’s clear that mans a sinner and that’s why god loved his children that he sacrificed himself. You see in Islam, Allah constantly tells you in the Quran he doesn’t need your prayers, but how desperately you really need him. You also will not be allowed to see Allah unless you’re privileged enough in a special level of heaven. And there are multiple levels of heaven, and lower levels will not be able to see Allah. But the highest level will, and they will get to enjoy seeing his face....lmao that’s some weird shit if u can imagine that bro. He doesn’t even show himself or would even dare to come to his people. He’s always denying he could never be a man, or come down to earth....Also you can’t really call Allah your father, nor can you say your his child. At least in Christianity Christ was nice. He wasn’t a warlord like Muhammed. He didn’t get any money or gain. He even knew he was going to get crucified and still continued to preach. 

The disciples also were tortured, they knew they were going to die but continued to preach. Muhammed on other hand was allowed to marry 9 wives. Why? Because this was special privilege from Allah because he’s a prophet...He was allowed to marry his adopted sons wife. There’s Hadith how his companions talked about him having strength of 100 men. And how he would see all his 9 wives and have sex an not shower. He also married a 6 year old. And the thing is you’re not allowed to laugh at this as a Muslim! I mean wtf does that info have to do with getting close to your creator ?? There’s Hadith how Aisha washed cum stains off his pants! There’s a Hadith how Solomon had sex with 900 women. Wtf does that have to do with spirituality. And my problem is you can’t argue or make fun or even question it. And moderate Muslims will defend him. 

The scary part is that they defend him, and if you critic it or challenge it, they will say you’re a islamophobe. Even if you nicely say it.

1056,fkvm0f1,"To be a Muslim you have to submit you will to Allah, that is the test of this life, and you do that for this life and then next life you will be rewarded. Letting someone know means that at least someone know your going somewhere and can inform other people if they ask your whereabouts, if you don't return in a certain amount of time they can sorry and at least have general knowledge on your whereabout or what you're doing, they can let you know if anything is happening where's or what they are doing.

Hindu liberals: Muslim women are dominated by their men by forcing them to cover their head. Liberate them! 🤦‍♂️"
1059,fliyyum,"
We’re not even allowed to listen to Music. I was taught that the devil was the first person to play a instrument. I grew up reading Quran verses that explicitly talk about the people of hellfire who will drink pus and hot boiling urine for drinks in hell. Children of age 4 memorize these verses and recite it. No joke!! I use to read books on the afterlife that would talk about non believers having their heads smashed with rocks in their grave by angels. Muhammed said it’s better to be stabbed with a nail than to touch a women that you’re not married to. And my parents convinced me if I didn’t listen to them I’d burn in hellfire with the non believers. Look bro..Quran is very explicit about hell. Children like myself at the time would recite verses about how non believers would burn so much in hell that their skin would burn off and Allah would instantly give them new skin, over and over and over for eternity! ! And we’d recite this verses while leading prayers, at eid parties while dads are drinking coffee and tea.

I had friends that went to Quran school full time for 3 years. They missed 3 years of middle school in order to sit 8 hours a day to memorize the entire Quran. While typical Christian kids were reading the bible on Sunday about Noah’s ark and the cute little animals he brought with, they also read the great gatsby. They also read of mice and men. They were in tune with modern day science. While some Muslim friends of mine even lived at the mosque and slept on the floors while going to Quran school at age 12. This Quran school bullshit goes on till this day. 

I  use to go after school and spend 3 hours everyday learning the Quran. Till this day I have cousins who don’t go to regular school to learn English, grammar, math, instead a imam comes to their house 3 times a week and forces them to memorize a book. This is very common. In Islam parents are told by Muhammed on day of judgement if their child memorized the Quran the parents will get a crown. I feel like these parents do it for themselves and not for their child. This isn’t a small group of Muslims. This is very common in most so called moderate Muslim communities.

Mormon are a crazy group as well as the jehovahs, bible banging evangelicals are too! and guess what? Most Christians will tell those people to fuck off and that they disagree. Even if the evangelical says that Christ said not to have sex outside of marriage, they will tell you they don’t care. And they will continue to believe in Christianity and carry on with their day. These Christians are moderate. Even if they’re conservative believe me bro, they’re moderate. The women can wear a dress and show skin and there’s none wrong with it. Long as she’s not running around in a gi string then you’re fine! 


But In islam, you can’t disagree with the sharia punishment. Allah is all knowing, and if he commands one to have their hand cut off for stealing, well you can’t argue, because Quran and Muhammed teach you that it’s a sin to critic the religion and can get you kicked out of Islam.

1060,fly0l15,"I think one of your biggest issue seems that you're  convinced that all muslims are the same that the ones in the west, especially the ones born and bred there, are the same as the ones in Saudi. That in itself is an exceptionally racist. Not all muslim nations are the same either. There are cultural differences as well. Most sylehti British women in the UK tend to wear a hijab but the ones from Dhaka dont. Thats just the case. If you speak with them, and I have similar background but im an ex-muslim, they all chose voluntarily to wear it. You can spend all your effort to imagine that reddit or certain newspapers/news channel must be right about muslims and about how Muslim women are treated. The whole 'a good friend of mine is the same' sounds a lot like 'i also have a black friend', im afraid. Also there is a significant problem with feminism works within the west, especially when it comes to intersectionality. It still discriminates heavily against women of colour and fails to give them voices. Not everything is black and white."
1061,fmijp45,Isn’t this why muslim women are required to wear hijab?
1062,fmqkjka,So you really think the majority of muslim women are choosing hijab and not being forced?
1063,fmt5dew,"&gt;I would like to address the strange paradoxical nature of this, because if they truly feel troubled with their position in society then they would naturally rebel and change society. However as shown muslim women are completely content with their place in a society which is portrayed by the west as 'male dominated', which means that:


I'm sorry, have you gone door to door and asked each Muslim women if they are happy to be in the position they are in? Of course not, because you probably wouldn't even be able to talk to them.

Do they even know that they could be treated differently? Islamic culture greatly enforces men to have authority over women. Do you think you would hear every women's complaint about Islamic culture? 

You see protests in Iran where women refuse to wear the hijab. You see women fighting female circumcision all over Islamic African countries. Women just got the ability to drive in Saudi Arabia this decade, and the had to fight for it.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/iranian-woman-beaten-for-wearing-loose-hijab-fights-back-and-goes-viral-1.991834

A lot of the time when women speak up in Islamic countries they are jailed or beaten. I don't see how can you be so conceited. 

&gt;If there is an issue with society then people will try and fix it when they have the means. 

They're trying. They are just getting arrested and beaten. 

&gt;In this situation, we have outside characters who see a society as inherently sexist, but the men and women in said society don't see it as so. If women in a patriarchal society are for the most part happy then is there something truly wrong with that society?

By your view, there is absolutely nothing wrong with China, the United States, or North Korea.

A society could be completely happy without relying on modern medicine. However it is a duty of humanity to provide everyone the best medicine they can get. It is the duty of humankind to look after the well-being and happiness of every person. To ignore women being treated unfairly in other socieites is unethical. Especially when women in those countries are calling out.

The greater freedom a person can achieve, the better the society is. Obviously we can't grant complete freedom to everyone, and most everyone doesn't want that. Islam doesn't give women the choice to be in more authoritative roles. 

&gt;People act in a society for their own regards to their welfare, not to what outsiders think. Perhaps some of it has to be dealt from their pov and not yours, or for a lack of a better word, one needs to see this from an eastern standpoint than a western one.

And vice versa.

&gt;Last point, in a patriarchal society it's not men oppressing women are 'innocent and helpless', it's men and women who believe that said system is correct and rightful. A more violent example would be something like FGM (and tbh it doesn't happen in the ME that much), its not just men who say that it's right, it's also women who believe that it's correct. When you see a picture of it happening, you're seeing a child who thinks it's right but is still pained, and a man and woman who both believe that it's the right thing

I've made this point twice now. The issue is that most men and women in patriarchal socieites don't choose that its correct, they are forced to believe its correct. You can't not choose to participate in a patriachal family when your family, neighbors, and government all participate. 

But just because a North Korean has no issues with their government, or an Islamic women doesn't want equality, doesn't mean their isn't a problem."
1064,fjzigwh,"In Islam women are required to a hijab and cover her whole body. In Saudi Arabia it's required by law, and some Islamic men are zealous enough to kill or rape a woman for showing her hair or skin."
1065,fhe4t96,Depends if you’ll be in a hijab or not. Muslim women are some of the most beautiful women / d I grew up never paying attention sigh....need to make up for time loss ;)
1066,fhels4z,"&gt;The Hijab is context specific aswell, you wear it in public.

Exactly...all the time. And sometimes women are severely punished if they take it off.

&gt;You said westerners did not understand this concept but thats a lie...

I said Westerners may have difficulty understanding it, meaning Westerners do not have a gender specific clothing standards with the scope Muslims do.

&gt;This analogy works. 

I disagree for the reasons I've state previously.

&gt;If you want to say it’s oppressive then you must admit that me being compelled to wear any type of clothing here in the west is oppressive because I am nudist. 

I guess you could make that argument, and I'm sure someone has made it, but there are nudist colonies where you can do exactly that regardless of gender and nudists are not the majority unlike Muslims in their large communities and countries. 

Nonetheless, scope, how much and where it occurs, is an important factor here and it's really the primary distinction. Hijabs and other coverings for Muslim women are ubiquitous, they are everywhere and in *every* public context. That is not the same as being a nudist in a nudist colony. Schools will punish students for not following their dress code *but only in school or under the supervision of the school*. Once they are not under that yoke they are free to wear whatever they want *at home* ***and*** *in public*.

&gt;Being outside the home IS a specific context lmao. 

Yes it is but it is a context that can have numerous sub-contexts which is what we have been conversing about. I have specifically stated numerous times that we are talking about public spaces so you're being a bit disingenuous by making this erroneous distinction now. **Just so we're clear, I have been speaking about public spaces, not the home.** You may need to reread my responses within that context if it would make them more understandable.

&gt;School girls are meant to dress a certain way every time they enter their government run facility. 

School boys also have the same burden. And to reiterate, this is a specific public context at a specific time, ***not every public context and every time (also public) like for Muslim women.*** 

&gt;This proves that westerners not only understand the concept but employ it themselves. 

Sure Westerners can understand the concept but the scope, and I'll add reasons that apply to only one gender, seem oppressive."
1067,fhkhe1x,"There are a few reasons why the Muslim women don't

experience heat exhaustion from what they are wearing:

First, while Muslim women are not restricted to wearing only
dark clothes, those who choose to wear them do so by
choosing appropriate materials. Most of these are flimsy and
airy materials that are not necessarily see-through due to their

dark tones.

Second, in hot and humid countries like Malaysia,

Brunei and Singapore, women rarely wear a lot of fabrics.

Hijabs are shorter and most of the time in lighter shades.

sia,

Third, in countries like Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan, lawn
cotton is very popular. It is a thin and lightweight cotton
material that hardly makes the wearer feel hot at all.

Fourth, these women have already adjusted to the hot weather
and high temperature. I'll give an example. I am from Malaysia
and I wear a lot of fabrics. I am usually in a dark, long hijab of
lightweight material. Malaysia is hot and humid all year round:

we are in summer forever! My body has already adjusted itself
to the heat that the minute I step out without wearing a few
layers of fabric, I'd feel unusually chilly. When I went to
northern Pakistan in winter, I wore 8 layers of thick clothing in
7 degrees celsius and still frozen. We had to leave the
mountainside and went down to the city of Peshawar, as 14
degrees celsius in the city was all my body could take with the
same 8 layers of thick clothing.

Lastly, as one of the earlier answers suggested, it is a mind

over matter thing. As long as it isn't over 50 degrees celsius,
women in long dark clothing don't seem to have a lot of
trouble prancing around town in their garb.

I hope that answers your question."
1068,fhm7tw4,My abo was like 'muslim women are the most free women in the world' and he also claims that they have to wear hijab. A lot of muslim people in the west think like this which is so confusing.
1069,fhqxowb,"What did this man say to his wife that was problematic and dehumanizing? It seems from your comment that you were personally there, so please elaborate so we can better understand. 

Most people, regardless of religion, just place their order without talking to much outside of that. I'm just wondering why this man would make digs at his wife in public while ordering bagels or whatever. ""Hi. I'll have a cinnamon-walnut-raisin bagel with cream cheese and for this WORTHLESS HAG standing next to me I guess she can just have a plain bagel because SHE DOESN'T DESERVE ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT!""

I am a white American woman, formerly an Agnostic Atheist, who reverted to Islam (after studying Middle Eastern politics in college) and later married an Egyptian Muslim man.

A few months after reverting I decided, with my own free will (!), to start wearing a turban and long cardigans with my jeans and t-shirts. Becoming more aware of God and more aware of myself made me gradually start to become more concerned with covering the shape of my body from strangers. 

Some time later I bought a few maxi dresses and began wrapping my scarf as a hijab because I liked the way the fabric covered my chest that way.

A couple of years later, I started wearing really loose dresses (abayat) with my hijab.

A year and a half after moving to Egypt with my husband (again, with my own free will!) I decided I wanted to wear the niqab (face veil). Most of the women in his family wear really Western clothes, bikinis at the beach all summer, short tight dresses at weddings...you get the picture. So they all think I've lost my mind and that he's lost his for marrying me and staying married to me.

I have my own personal reasons for taking these steps toward dressing more modestly over a period of several years and I could certainly attempt to explain some of these for those truly seeking to understand what leads a person to makes these decisions, but it would definitely be quite lengthy!

I have, in recent years, for the first time in my life, fully embraced being a woman, and have come to feel a sense of modesty and reservation in front of men I don't know.

What I wear in front of my husband is different from what I wear in front of my brothers, and what I wear in front of my brothers is different from what I wear in front of random men in the streets whose intentions I cannot possibly be aware of!

I am completely satisfied with my relationship with my husband, and I literally feel revolted by the idea of random creepers checking me out, hitting on me, or even feeling the slightest bit interested in or attracted to me.

Before moving to Egypt, for example, I was an intern at a company founded by three men who graduated from a local Catholic university together. I was wearing the hijab and dresses and only really talked when necessary, and everyone knew I was married because my husband came in to bring me coffee on my lunch break a few times...yet in spite of all that, one of my managers started subtly hitting on me, and eventually even asked me if I wanted to go out to lunch with him to try a new vegetarian restaurant together! I was shocked. 

Men like this exist. They are always going to exist. No amount of protesting, picket-sign holding, petition signing or hashtag using is going to make men stop hitting on women. I came to realize that I cannot make every man on planet Earth behave themselves, but I can give them no reason whatsoever to engage with me.

For religious reasons and because of my own experiences, I wear the niqab, I work remotely from home, and when I am in public, I purposely do not draw attention to myself.

When I'm at the grocery store or at a restaurant, I don't say anything unless I really have to, and in that case, I lean in toward my husband and tell him what I need to in a low voice. Short, sweet, to the point. I do this intentionally FOR A REASON. He always orders for me in restaurants because HE IS A GENTLEMAN, not because he is dehumanizing and controlling me and treating me like a child. He knows what I want to order because we discuss it before our server comes over or at certain favorite restaurants, he knows what I always get so there's no need to talk about it.

I feel that you've made some pretty wild assumptions about the relationship between the couple you saw. Why are you so certain that ""\[t\]he husband had his wife all decked in black, face covered""?  What if this is truly how SHE feels most comfortable dressing in public, and she chose to marry a man who respects the fact that she deliberately conceals her God-given beauty from strange men? 

Why do you assume that a man ordering for his wife is a way of controlling, humiliating, infantilizing and degrading her as opposed to way of honoring her?

In Islam, a woman has to consent to marriage, i.e., she can't be forced to marry a man she does not want to marry. You should know that if you see a woman in a niqab with her husband, she chose to marry that man, and she surely would not choose to marry a man who she knows in advance is going to force her to do what she does not want to do.

Especially if you see a niqabi in the West, you can almost guarantee that she chose to wear it, probably with extreme resistance from her family! Most Muslims who move to the West did so in order for their children to have a more liberal upbringing and they detest anything that reminds them of the way things were ""back home"" in a Muslim-majority country!

I have a dear friend who was born and raised as a Muslim in Canada to a family originally from Afghanistan, and her father was majorly upset with her decision to wear the niqab! Her father, and the rest of her family, identify as Muslims and practice some of the basics of the religion, but they are against anything that seems ""too religious"" and resisted and criticized her decision to become more practicing. 

She chose to marry a man who appreciates and respects women who wear the niqab. Soooo if anyone had ever seen them at Tim Hortons together and witnessed her husband ordering for her, they would have been WAY OFF BASE to think that he forced her to dress like that and only ordered for her as a form of cruelty and a way to deny her of her humanity.

It is apparent that you viewed the couple you saw through a lens filtered with your own inner biases and preconceived notions. Without having asked a niqab-wearing Muslim woman about her reasons and beliefs and experiences, you instead formed your own assumptions, which surely cloud your judgement and have led you to believe that 1.) most Muslim men humiliate and belittle and unfairly control their wives in public and in private ""every day of their lives"" and that 2.) Muslim women are helpless victims who need non-Muslim feminist white women to intervene on their behalf and save them from their own husbands.

I'm here to tell you that you are mistaken, and that you have seriously misread the intentions behind why Muslim men often speak on behalf of their wives and why Muslim women often veil their faces. I hope that my personal anecdotes shed some light on the reality of why we do these things. Perhaps this will cause you question and evaluate the accuracy of your own inner narrative the next time you see a niqabi with her husband.

I respect myself and i value my body. I ABSOLUTELY do not want my body to be exposed for others to see except for my partner. I feel so uncomfortable having my valuables exposed :) it isnt about confidence or thinking that i look ugly. Its about value. Ugly or beautiful, this body is still mine to take care of.

So stop assuming and believing in mainstream mindset blindly that muslim women are wearing our oppressed hats. Get your facts right. Have you ever asked a muslim woman yourself why they wear the hijab? Wake up.

And for those who are ignorant and know nothing about why we wear the hijab in islam: Back in the old days, women have always been looked at as just a sexual object. And islam gave rights to women by allowing us to cover our bodies from filthy lustful eyes. It is to protect ourselves.

Just look at how women are looked at today. You cant even sell food without putting a picture of a naked woman next to it. Its disgusting. Wake up!!! Modesty and morality is dying. So much shamelessness.

Just look at Mother Mary. Even she wears a cloth over her head. Its the hijab. Yes muslims believe in Jesus and Mary. And we follow Jesus's and Mary's ways more than christians do. Not to offend but its a fact. Maybe try to stop being so ignorant and go do some research."
1071,fi02npj,"I'm not incredibly knowledgable but as a hijabi I'll try my best to answer.

1. Modesty. (Men have their own dress code as well, dw lol)
2. Identification purposes (Back then, most women would cover their hair but only Muslim women are ordered to cover their chest too. I like to think that God chose women as public ambassadors of Islam since its not as easy to figure out if a man is a Muslim via dress code alone.)
3. A form of remembrance of God (This is more of an opinion, but my mother told me that she wouldn't sit in pubs {although it is permissible as long as you don't consume alcohol, as far as i know} because she had the hijab on, meaning that she was scared of others getting the wrong impression of Islam due to her sitting there.)

Hope this helped!"
1072,fi4dylg,"That's absolute bullshit. Islamic women (by the way, they are called Muslim women or Muslimah) don't wear covering clothes to protect themselves from harassment or sexual violence. They do it only to follow Allah's commandments and direction. Wearing the hijab doesn't protect someone from sexual violence any more than someone wearing a mini-skirt inviting sexual violence against them. Hundreds of thousands of Muslim women are sexually abused just like millions of provocatively dressed women are abused in non-Muslim countries. What women wear or not wear is no way at all responsible for sexual violence."
1073,fimnk6w,"&gt;You should definitely read on up Irish history.

And here we go. Let me guess, all muslim terror attacks of today are okay because ""muh crusades over a thousand years ago"", right?

&gt;You're also talking as though all Muslim women are at risk of beatings for not wearing their hijabs, and that's utter bullshit.

The vast majority sure as hell is. Even if they say that it's their choice. In Iran there are currently women in jail for taking off their hijab. 

Also the total lack of self awareness of trying to sell me this ""not all muslims"" after trying to demonize all nuns because of this one thing that probably didn't even happen like that.

&gt;And this just shows that you are coming from a place of bigotry and wilful ignorance.

Because I talk about muslims like you people talk about christians?

&gt;It's really weak and that kind of thing that gets you laughed out of any half-serious debate.

Again with this sheer lack of self awareness. What is it with you guys and not realizing that?"
1074,fiswlnq,"My parents and their opinions. (This has to do with religion). Ok so this is me: this one atheist raised by Latinos who is also bi and queergender, buuuut born female (I’m happy still hehe). Anyways, I’ve always been interested in wearing a headscarf (hijab-style). I have no certain idea why, but it’s just how I feel protected and comfortable. My hair is a part of my body that I consider I should cover, for different personal reasons. Headscarf symbolizes a lot of things to me, it’s simply my own way of feeling confortable (I know there’s other ways to feel protected too, but this is my way). Anyways, I remember everything started well: I bought some small chiffon headscarves from Amazon and my parents were chill with me wearing them (my mom was even kinda proud of me for being so brave). Then, I bought an actual headscarf meant for hijab as it said in the listing (I wasn’t going to use it for religious purposes because like, I ain’t going to fake that I am part of the religion) and my mom did not like the idea. She kept telling me that it was too big and was going to be too noticeable and distracting when I’m in public. Whatever. I just put it away somewhere and saved it for when I turn 18 so I can start using it (idk). After wearing my chiffon headscarfs many times, I realized how damn annoying my hair is. Little strands of hair start popping out on the front of my head and I end up with hair bothering my face. Guess what... I bought an underscarf (because why not lol it made my life easier). It was a black underscarf, my size, just perfect. Buuuuuut then there’s my parents. My mom went nuts. She kept yelling at me about how I’m not a Muslim and the fact that I wear a headscarf means that I am making fun of Muslim people and it looks ridiculous. (Backstory: I have made research in whether it is accepted by most Muslims that non-Muslims wear hijab, and most of the results said that there’s no problem with it as long as you don’t act disrespectfully). So I was constantly repeating to my mom that whether I was religious or not it was something that nobody knew or should know, and I’m just covering my hair, people shouldn’t give me weird stares unless it’s just for discrimination against Muslims (which they don’t even know if I am when I’m in public). People sadly and stupidly find it weird or out of place around my society, so that’s why they would give stares. But she kept telling me that wearing a headscarf is indeed symbolizing the Muslim religion and only Muslim women are supposed to wear it and I’m just like “but they’re fine with it if other women also feel protected by it, there’s no harm” but she kept saying that I would offend them. She yelled at me so hard when I said that giving weird and confused stares to a woman just for wearing a headscarf was discrimination... she forced me to look up the word “discrimination” on the dictionary on my iPad to prove me wrong, then just went on that my vocabulary is terrible because I don’t know the meaning of words or whatever... at this point I don’t even argue it anymore. My dad didn’t want to complain about anything to me, but my mom forced him to and then he went on saying that I am not Muslim and by wearing a headscarf I was symbolizing that I was Muslim, which meant wearing a costume. I could tell by his face that he did not want to tell me this. I didn’t want to let the bad vibes stop me from simply covering my hair. I am so thankful to be in a country in which I have the freedom to dress however I want, but my mom said that it only applies when it comes to religious purposes. My mom is catholic and my dad is just like meh about religion. The argument ended with my mom still being mad at me and leaving my room. I just hid all my headscarves and never wanted to see them again. All the beautiful headscarves I bought... all the things I looked forward to were gone, destroyed, and vanished by the discrimination and racism that still exists along my community. This was months before I even declared myself queergender (I’m fine with staying in a female body... but my mind and desires to be both, all, or no spectrums) and up to this day I still want to start wearing headscarf when I go to college. I am scared if this will make my life difficult not only around my family but also in finding a job or making friends... my parents left me an emotional trauma after all. Because I am not religious, I will make exceptions and take the headscarf off depending on the occasion. But I’m still scared... I don’t even have the support of my parents. I sometimes sneak some long pastel headscarfs into the bathroom and take pictures with them on. It’s the only way to feel comfortable now. Tried to do it once, and wish me luck on trying again one day :’) Please love yourselves."
1075,fj1ltfo,"The only place Muslim women are required to wear the hijab is in the mosque. It's good policy to be modest (this goes for both genders) in general and that's why some Muslim women wear the hijab outside of her house. But it's not mandatory.

1076,fja1im7,"&gt;It is clear who is being oppressed more 


Are you saying that Muslim women are less oppressed than women from other groups? 

Because if yes, then it is incorrect. 



And it is great if someone likes to wear it because they like it but the thing is that having such a choice is a luxary of the privileged. What would you say about the women that wear hijabs on the street covering themselves all day? They aren't doing it because they felt like it, they are doing it because their family forces them to. 



And are you seriously going to compare a ghoonghat to a full blown Hijab? Sure ghoonghats suck blue balls but are they anywhere close to hijabs? 


And yes everything you mentioned is oppression of women but they in no way undermine the fact that forcing a woman to cover even the last nudge of skin on her body and wear a suffocating veil all day is oppression too."
1077,fjmbwkc,"&gt; Also, I am happy to learn about women in islamic regimes and how I can help.

You can start by rejecting the social pressure being put on western society to accept Islamic practices. Don't partake in ""Wear a hijab day"" in solidarity with Muslim women. Doing so is promoting the acceptance of oppression of women. Millions of Muslim women are forced to wear them and they aren't even allowed to say they wish they couldn't because they'll be beaten in the streets (there are many videos of this happening in middle eastern nations)."
1078,fjz8zf2,"That doesn't change the fact that a lot of Muslim women are wearing a hijab due to pressure and expectation, not because they ""feel like it""."
1079,fjzhn9m,It’s funny because in America Muslim women are afraid to wear the hijab because of harassment.

1081,fk1os0h,"It's true that even if you show them ""look, Muslim women are in science, tech, etc"", they'll never be satisfied. They'll move on to the Hijab and other matters related to women in Islam. The only thing that will satisfy them is if Muslim women leave the religion. Also, why are we looking for non-Muslims for validation?"
1082,fe9obig,"I agree with you generally. The catch is that there are some parts of religion that are pretty distasteful or problematic. The hijab is a good example. Sure, it's cultural attire but it's also required attire as Muslim women are ordered to be modest. So not exactly great for empowering women! That's why women in Iran are currently protesting the hijab and going to jail for it."
1083,fea5cqv,"I'm all for choice. I'd like, however, to see the pro-hijab feminists stand up for women who do not wish to wear the hijab, and indeed who reject it as a symbol of feminism.

Further, given how horribly women are treated in Islamic society, it would be very reasonable for somebody to assume that a symbol representing Islam also may be a symbol representing misogyny. Saying this, say, on a university campus in America, will get you pilloried as an ""Islamophobe"".

Finally, let's not pretend that the hijab is like a habit. Lay Muslim women are required--not by the Koran but that's a whole other discussion--to wear the hijab."
1084,feglymi,"That’s so fucking ignorant. Read the stories on r/exmuslim about how US Muslim women are treated by family and community when they take off their hijab. You really have no clue.

Please spend some time with ex Muslims before you speak."
1085,fejsf92,"The women of Iran are not the Muslim women of Australia, or America, or Turkey or Tunisia or Israel or India or Bangladesh. Muslim women are not the same everywhere around the world.

If women in other countries want to take off their hijabs in some kind of show of solidarity with Iranian women, that's nice, I guess? 

I mean it won't change the law in Iran, but it would be a nice show of support.

But they also shouldn't be shamed if they actually want to wear a hijab.

Then you're literally *no better* than some conservative muslim parents shaming their daughter for going bare-headed."
1086,fekjdb5,well Muslim women are banned from wearing hijab in China where the match took place. what was she supposed to do!
1087,feldr30,"I got downvoted to hell in the wholesome subreddit for saying that hijab is oppression. 

Little girls are told from birth that they must cover themselves in humility to the Lord. Meanwhile, the men can prance around wearing essentially whatever they want (as long as it covers their genitals). They read a holy book that blatantly says that two women are worth one man, that says 4 male witnesses must testify in behalf of a woman, that says it’s ok for a man to have up to four wives and that his wives are his ‘fields to plow’. 

Muslim women are always trying to justify their religion. “Muslim women get to keep their last names! We can divorce our husbands if we want to!’ That’s cool but what’s not cool is telling women that they need to cover their heads-their heads that holds all their thoughts, ideas, plans- because their lord thinks they are unworthy to be seen as equal to men. 

People are so afraid of criticizing this religion for some reason."
1088,fesbk7u,"Considering the fact that I came from a different background, there are a few issues that I am not able to understand or comprehend completely.

It appears to me that the ban on religious symbols is directed at the Muslims and Jews since their religions require them to wear visible symbols like hijab or kippah. For Christians or Buddhists, obviously they don’t have to wear cross and whatnots all day.

Yes, I understand Canada is a liberal country. As a Liberal Arts student, I totally support that. However, it is also true that in many aspects Islam is a misogynistic religion (I mean, from the secular standpoint, worse than Christianity or Buddhism). I genuinely couldn’t understand why Muslim women are forced to cover their hair, it seems very problematic to me.

There are many other things that bother me, of course, but I really couldn’t comprehend why the ‘liberal students’ would defend a sexist and homophobic religion. It’s 2020 already; and while they are defending the so-called religious freedom, I hope they could educate themselves more about theology and gender&amp;queer study instead of brainlessly blocking students out of their class BECAUSE they actually want to learn something.

I guess my opinion is rather unpopular. I genuinely hope the university education would encourage students to think individually and critically instead of acting violently in the name of ´freedom’. I just saw a post of a Muslim student complaining that she was denied entry to the Education building by a white male student. It really bothers me how the white liberals are full of themselves and deliberately ignore the voices of others. What’s happening really exceeds my comprehension."
1089,fewg9b1,"On past 'World Hijab day' celebrations, Western feminists donned the hijab in solidarity with Muslim women who are supposedly oppressed in the West for wearing it.  One wonders will these same women now speak out in defense of Shohreh Bayat's right *not* to wear it?

Highly unlikely.

Muslim women are premier members of the victimology narrative here in the Western world....but only when they're oppressed by *Western* society (where - ironically - they are most free to be themselves). Otherwise, their stories....their cries for help....are mostly unwelcome and go unheard. No one seems to want to upset the intersectional apple-cart."
1090,ff1lvar,"The swastika is different from the hijab. The oppression Jews faced was explicit, while muslim women are oppressed through ways that are deemed appropriate by themselves. No jew would support the holocaust, but some muslim women choose to wear hijab. I agree that there is a lot of mysoginy besides hijab and many muslim women disagree with that, yet support their decision or requirement to wear hijab. 

That leaves women who *would* call it oppression. I agree that it is ideal to fight the injustice by destroying symbols, but we have to realize that for some people islam is truth. Something Hitler decided on his own is refutable, while something Allah supposedly said is not. We cannot expect muslims to understand that and remove their hijab. Their world view is tainted with the absolute claim of their religion. 

And to address your question, of course I think wearing a swastika is insensitive. It is associated with genocide and racism. So I was thinking, if I was living in an oppressive environment where I was forced to wear niqab and be submissive, would I be offended when I fled to the west and saw people choosing to wear hijab? Maybe, but I would recognize that it is a choice they made and no matter how stupid it is, their truth is real to them."

Asians like Chinese,Japanese and Koreans are actually more conservative than the western nations but magnitudes more liberal than the islamic countries.


muslim women are brainwashed from birth to wear the covering, whether it is a cute simple shawl, a loosely held hijab or a flat out ugly burkah that looks like a trash bag. I have seen parents forcing actual little girls as small as 5 year old to wear a hijab in public. Are you saying that 5 year olds were wearing it out of choice ?? They are given no choice by their overly control freak religious parents.

Throwaway account. I have a degree in history, with a minor in theology. I am not Muslim. I am also old enough to remember the upheaval in the Middle East during the 70s and 80s. 

I've participated in a local feminist group for well over a decade.About a week ago at a coffee meet someone showed a meme that a man made, telling black women to basically wear the hijab and get in line . People started in on his audacity, and another woman questioned why the makeup in the picture is okay with this kind of  man, but showing hair isn't.

A young Muslim woman born here in Canada stated that ""Wearing hijab has literally nothing to do with men. When I wore it for a decade, it was because I wanted to.""

So I pointed out that there are places in the world that women don't have a choice and she can't speak to their experience.

We were discussing it back and forth and she got  defensive. Then she told me ""Women who aren't Muslim have no right to speak to ME about being Muslim"". A couple of her friends piled on, claiming that I'm racist, xenophobic and that I need to STFU because I'm not Middle Eastern and have no right to speak for them; I was invalidating her.. The last straw came when they told me to stop whitesplaining. The Muslim woman in question is a (very) white woman who has never stepped foot in the Middle East, as are her supporters. The others aren't Muslim.

I told them that you don't have to be a Muslim woman to know that a lot of Muslim women are being oppressed, and that some of these countries have been condemned for it since long before she was born.  That she can't unilaterally decide that hijabs have nothing to do with men, when it's clear that some women are doing it explicitly because of men.

Coincidentally, I'm friends with quite a few Muslim women who grew up in places like Syria and Afghanistan due to my job, several of whom dropped the hijab the moment they got to Canada from that part of the world. They definitely never wore it because they wanted to.

To me, what I did was no worse than telling someone of Irish Catholic descent living in the US that they can't speak for the Catholics living in Dublin. To her, I'm the worst kind of person. Things were getting so heated, I left.

 Since then, they've been coming at me full tilt online; I've been called racist, xenophobic, a whitesplainer, etc. The friends I mentioned above think she's being ridiculous.

I'm angry about this, as the group has always been intersectional. How can we help make sure that other groups of women aren't left behind if most of us aren't.  allowed to talk about anything but the white Christian (in my case, atheist) experience? At this point, I'm even considering walking away from the group altogether to avoid having to deal with them.

I'm open to changing my mind if I'm wrong but these particular women would not be the ones to do it.

So Reddit, what do you think? Am I the asshole?

1097,fg7j6ky,"Right, but you forgot how Muslim women are forced to conform to a huge societal pressure to don the hijab, niqab or burqa. Go ahead and see for yourself. Go to Egypt, where majority of women wear the hijab, not out of piety, but due to force. The same example here can be applied to any Muslim country really. As for ""Arabic drama"" or really any kind of TV shows, it's simple why hijabis aren't portrayed. That's for the reason of the hijab's political and religious nature, and most people wouldn't like seeing a hijabi in a tv show anyway. That's why most women who appear in TV shows and films in Islamic and Muslim countries don't wear the hijab, and they're but a fringe; a minority among Muslim women.

Her father is an abusive prick, as if the only reason people become Muslim is through strict indoctrination.

Islam is patriarchal in tradition like every religion to exist is, but any form of mistreatment and unequal rights that women get in “islamic” countries has nothing to do with Islam and the Quran itself. Women are viewed as equal with men in the Quran and at the time of Muhammad women were allowed to own land and businesses, just like his wife had. The hijab and other things exclusive to Islamic women are not even mentioned in the Quran.

In some circumstances like how in Afghanistan the Taliban force women to wear a Burqu(I think this is the correct term, I’m sorry if it’s not) it is oppressive because they aren’t given the choice to choose. 

Women who chose with their own free will to wear a hijab aren’t being oppressed though. It’s their body, their choice. They’re doing it for personal reasons they don’t have to explain and that we shouldn’t question. 

It’s all about choice. Whether they choose to wear it or are being forced to. I understand there is a stereotype that muslim women are oppressed and mistreated by men but that’s not always the case. Women of all religions can be mistreated, men of all religions can be mistreated."

No.

&gt;Muslim women can’t even hold a job or leave the house without their husband’s permission

Wrong, the permission in islam isn't asking the man if you can do something or not, it's sharing with him what you're doing. So, if a woman decides to go visit someone let's say, she's expected to tell her husband ""hey honey, I'm visiting blah blah today,"" or whatever the situation may be. However, if the man has a regressive mindset of his own (aka male supremacist) she can divorce him, although she should've known that beforehand since such stuff are discussed during engagement.

Funny cuz my American liberal friend literally got mad the other day cuz his girlfriend didn't tell him she was spending Christmas with her family out of town.



&gt;They can’t be imams or sheikhs.

Wrong. Men are imams/sheikhs for men. Women are imams/sheikhs for women. Although Aisha was an imam for both men and women back in the early islamic days, since she was one of the most knowledgeable scholars.

&gt;They can’t travel without Mahrams,

In the 7th century, arabia was merely a desert, women could get raped by bandits so a mahram was a way of protecting women while they travelled. If they wanted to control women, they would'nt have allowed them to travel in the first place. Now, there's no bandits on airplanes, so we travel normally just like anybody else.


&gt;. They have to cover themselves up while men don’t.

Both men and women are expected to dress modestly with the hijab (headscarf) being an extra item for women, cuz obviously  it's pointless for men to wear headscarves. By the way, the hijab isn't exclusive to islam, it's in the bible too.


&gt;can’t even arrange their own marriages

Wrong, arranged marriages are literally arranged by women. However, the initial meeting is the only arranged step in the whole process, so if she doesn't like him (or if *he* doesn't like *her*) they can go ""thank you, next"" 
Not to mention that the way someone's (girl or guy) decides to pursue  marriage is entirely dependent on their
personality.  If you want love, seek love. I myself have conflicting thoughts about marriage.


&gt;Aside from their sexual use

What sexual use? Are you saying you won't be having sex with your wife/husband? 


&gt;Muslim women are just background noise.

Yeah right. You should meet me in person then."
1111,fdf725i,"Why are disabled and black women being compared to this bs? You can stop being trans. People detransition all the time. White girls that pretend to be Muslim and wear a hijab can stop being religious like they did with Christianity. 

You can't just stop being black or disabled... some Muslim women are brainwashed and threatened by their families to remain in the religion."
1112,fdgqk2f,"I think its because western feminism has evolved so much to work against cultural oppression to cover up, hide their sexuality, etc. that they see women who willingly cover up because of religious beliefs as going against that cause. Feminists in general want people to stop objectifying them and telling them to cover up because it “distracts” them or makes them a target for sexual harassment. In one aspect, people who choose covering gives these entitled men an excuse to police other women who don’t cover up, and also incites other women to criticize and slut-shame each other too. For example, Breastfeeding in public would be heavily shamed and considered sinful by other Muslims, but the feminist movement is trying to say that breastfeeding shouldn’t be considered a sexual thing and babies should be able to be fed anywhere and at anytime, not hidden in dirty toilet stalls or forced to wait and cry until the woman can do it in the privacy of her own home. 


In some Muslim countries, this isn’t so much of an issue because with more gender segregation there are more women-only spaces. Plenty of “public” places they can breastfeed without exposure to the wandering eyes of men.  In a mixed society its a lot more difficult. 

When a non-muslim covers her hair, it’s considered fashion. I guess many non-muslims think that having a religious belief make it obligatory for women to cover their hair, it supports the idea that women are objects to be sexualized. Even if a woman chooses to wear a head scarf or it was a practice instilled by her family/environment. Most westerners are Christian or brought up on a foundation in some Christian values, and people not so much these days are calling women who show their hair or ankles or shoulders sinful whores who are gonna go to hell. So this idea, oh this girl is a Muslim and she believes she will go to hell or be rejected by God if she doesn’t cover her hair. Aren’t there more important things to worry about? 

This is obviously thought out of ignorance and misunderstanding about what hijab is. Real feminism is giving men and women autonomy over their life choices and their bodies. A woman who chooses to cover herself shouldn’t be any more criticized than a woman who chooses to wear very revealing clothes. 

I think most modern Muslim women are educated enough and understand that everyone’s faith and cultural background is different and judging other people is more sinful and not the right way to build a strong loving community, as Islam is supposed to represent. While we might disagree with another sister’s clothing choices its not up to us to condemn them. Its the men and older generations that are more judgmental."
1113,fdh1nrr,"Historian here. I see this kind of discourse as an extension of Western paternalism, although it's extremely ironic to have to use that term in reference to someone who identifies as a feminist. In the nineteenth century in particular there developed a strong current within Western thought depicting (white, male) Westerners as fully developed, rational adults and non-Westerners (or Western women) as [underdeveloped, irrational children in need of a ""strong hand"" to ""guide"" them toward proper behavior.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/%22The_White_Man%27s_Burden%22_Judge_1899.png) This is a worldview that played a major role in justifying European and American imperialism. Here we see it in one of its current forms: the idea that Muslim women who choose to wear the hijab can't *really* be doing so because of their own free, rational decision to do so, and that they need to be ""guided"" to the correct decision by Westerners, who really know better. It allows the people who think this way to ignore the fact that Muslim women are (surprise!) adult human beings capable of making their own decisions."
1114,fdirvwm,"Totally off topic but it was awkward when a cocky woman in a hijab rang up in my dept with a bunch of lingerie and kept talking about how she can't wait to see her husband.

Me: I can't get these hangers apart to ring it up. Gimmie a sec.

Her: *My husband will know exactly what to do*

I don't think a simple headscarf is a good metric for discerning how conservative Muslim women are."
1115,fdy99ja,And if a muslim woman says she WANTS to wear the hijab it’s because she’s been brainwashed by the brown/Islamic patriarchy into feeling that way. Not at all because muslim women are perfectly capable of making their own decisions on how they want to dress.
1116,f7j8q9p,"They’re supposed to. But certain themes / traditions of thought dominate, particularly white liberal feminism. Some of these feminists feel their particular conceptualisation of freedom and liberalisation is the only one and cannot stand that some women have alternative ways of living their lives with full knowledge and awareness of their choices. 

For example, one of the most glaring hypocrisies I experienced in TrollX was how whenever a women in a hijab was visible they would debate and argue about how she is an agency-less brainwashed victim of the patriarchy for wanting / choosing to cover her hair and body. But then in the same breath would praise women such as Billie Eilish who cover their bodies to prevent men from sexualising them /  to protect themselves from the male gaze. / shed expectations of female sexuality. They would also often idolise the act of a women who shaved their hair to emancipate themselves from female beauty standards etc. But, then couldn’t comprehend how a woman covering her hair could be anything other than subjugated. 

So the message I got was if I white women covers herself or doesn’t conform to having long flowing hair = feminist. If a brown woman does it = oppression and victim of patriarchy who doesn’t know better and needs to be liberated by western Mhysa’s. 

Last time I checked, one of the principle things feminism was concerned with letting women have agency over their own bodies and make choices suitable for themselves. But apparently not, apparently you can only be free if you wear shorts and crop tops and everyone can see your hair 🤔. It’s funny cos Muslim women don’t concern themselves with what non-Muslim women are wearing anywhere near the degree to which the the opposite is occurring. 

Anyway, most subs such as TrollX shouted down me and handful of Muslim women who ever tried to speak so I left them all to their echo chambers and mass unsubbed. 

I rarely bother engaging at all about feminism on Reddit anymore. Made an exception here just cos of the nature of your post"
1117,f7lmi9s,"I get the backlash as it is associating empowerment with doing makeup, fashion and showcasing yourself to the world. These type of events confirm the narrative of the west that Muslim women are oppressed because they wear hijab. I personally know a lot of muslim women in my life who have achieved great heights in education, are great doctors and engineers while being good practicing muslimahs at the same time. But I do agree with you that there is a lack of better alternatives and good on you to making an effort to change that"
1118,f7nb1q9,"If the Muslim women are choosing to wear the hijab of their own free will, all for it. More power to them.

But Islam is a very patriarchal religion and often times women are compelled to wear the hijab by their husbands and fathers.

Of course there are plenty of moderates who aren’t ordering their wives and daughters around, but unfortunately it’s still something that happens often."
1119,f7s29oi,It’s true that a lot of Muslim women are forced to wear hijab. Careful with that narrative though - a lot of Muslim women also mindfully make the choice to wear hijab and resent any notion of their being oppressed.
1120,f7xj3i7,"Not OP but I think it's unreasonable that Muslim women are the group to have to deal with the death stares because Muslim men aren't as easily identifiable. Especially given Muslim women have a whole plethora of other issues to deal with and oftentimes limited autonomy especially over the choice to wear hijab if they are raised Muslim.

Christians are also less identifiable and I would argue also have a bunch of child rape to answer for. I consider any modern Christians support of the church to be as questionable as a Muslim supporting Mohammed.

Ultimately I think that those who are abusing and targeting Muslim women are mostly racist jerks, and they're targeting the participants of the religion that are the most likely to suffer at its hands. There are criticisms to be made of most major religions but it is entirely unproductive to expect a Muslim woman doing her shopping to answer for the sins of Islam and its history. The same way it's unreasonable and unproductive of myself to accost my neighbour when she takes her bins out because she goes to the local Catholic church on Sunday."
1121,f7xlriq,"&gt;Not OP but I think it's unreasonable that Muslim women are the group to have to deal with the death stares because Muslim men aren't as easily identifiable.

I think this is true, but I think this is an artifact of how Islam views men (as agents and followers) and women (as property of men).

When you own something, it is important that everyone understands that it is yours.

&gt;Especially given Muslim women have a whole plethora of other issues to deal with and oftentimes limited autonomy especially over the choice to wear hijab if they are raised Muslim.

This is another reason why the religion should be criticized and criticized heavily.

&gt; Christians are also less identifiable and I would argue also have a bunch of child rape to answer for.

I would completely and 100% agree with that, the actions of the Catholic church in particular are disgusting in this regard.

&gt; I consider any modern Christians support of the church to be as questionable as a Muslim supporting Mohammed.

From the limited sample size I've spoken to, they tend to fall on the side of ""There's no proof"".

Regardless, anyone who says to me, ""I know Cardinal Pell did what he was accused of, I just think it's morally right that he did it"" then they can get fucked too.

&gt; Ultimately I think that those who are abusing and targeting Muslim women are mostly racist jerks

There's nothing racist about criticising a religion.

&gt; and they're targeting the participants of the religion that are the most likely to suffer at its hands.

All the more reason to criticize the religion more.

&gt; There are criticisms to be made of most major religions but it is entirely unproductive to expect a Muslim woman doing her shopping to answer for the sins of Islam and its history.

I don't approve of people being physically confronted and abused in public while just going about their day, but if someone wore a Nazi *Schutzstaffel* Waffen-SS uniform complete with red Swastika armband to Coles, I think very few people would think that it's ""unreasonable to expect a Nazi woman doing her shopping to answer for the sins of Nazi-ism and its history"".

Religion is a choice, and any religion that makes that less of a choice or *not* a choice at all should be criticized heavily and more vocally and more passionately than those who do not, rather than the opposite.

&gt;The same way it's unreasonable and unproductive of myself to accost my neighbour when she takes her bins out because she goes to the local Catholic church on Sunday.

I agree, but it's also totally unreasonable to suggest that if you do decide to not invite your neighbour to your Christmas barbarque because of what she believes, that you're engaging in anti-white bigotry, racism, and are a Nazi."
1122,f8225r5,"I have to give you a Δ

Your last line, 

&gt;No one gets to decide for her what is the most feminist, that’s the whole point.

Got me thinking a lot and made me realize in almost all situations of oppression, it is the role of the oppressed to lead their liberation movements and to communicate their needs and criticisms of the systems of oppression to those who have the power to change those systems. 

The gay rights movement didn't originate in straight cis people telling gays that they needed to be liberated from homophobia; the slow degradation of women consensually participating in and defending traditional Christian gender/family structures didn't originate in secularists telling them that they're oppressed, rather it came from women affected by those systems making their needs known and finding allies among men/those in power in the patriarchy. 

Muslim women are not crying out for liberation from hijabs, or decrying hijabs as an oppressive institution that they believe needs to be destroyed. Hell, most Muslim women who choose to not wear hijab aren't particularly critical of it either. It is entirely up to Muslim women to decide what is and isn't oppressive to them and up to us as non-Muslims, as men, as Americans/Europeans to listen to them and criticize according to what they need. A Muslim woman choosing to wear a hijab in a place where it's not socially mandated might be participating in a ritual sexist in its origin, but its up to the woman to decide if its sexist."
1123,f82kx5v,"Babies shouldn't be in hijabs. That is clear and tbh I think it's awful. Babies should be free to be babies. Beyond that I wish people would stop controlling and politicising what women wear. Muslim women get it from both sides and its honestly very upsetting and stressful. Women have the right to wear whatever they wish for whatever reason without having to deal with comments or harrasment. Be that covered women or bikiniclad women and everything in between. 

For as long as human history people have debated and politicised and controlled what women wear. Furthermore, whenever there is an issue in society, sadly its always innocent women who have to be on the front lines. If your hubby really has an issue with men making women cover up, surely should address with those men or men from those communities and leave the women out of it? And this has always been my issue with the hijab debate. Often it's not about helping women. It's just about critising and controlling them. If anyone truly believes that Muslim women are being  forced against their will to cover up (which does happen sadly) then how is making laws against women, attacking women and victimising women going to solve that problem?"
1124,f8dcjhp,"With a little google searching you can find a lot, [but this might be a good start:](http://dvov.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Position-Paper-on-FoRB-and-the-Cham-People.pdf)

* Loss  of  Self-Determination: While  the  Cham  in  Vietnam  are recognized by  the  Vietnamese government as one of 54 ethnic groups, there remains no acknowledgement of their indigenous status. Self-determination in  demarcated  territories  was  lost  after 1975. Previously,  communal  lands  were distributed  to  religious  dignitaries,  mosques,  and  temples with  villages  headed  and  managed  by  a native Cham.In 1975, this system was dismantled as all land was seized and redistributed to be under government management. With  no  knowledge  of  Cham  traditional  or  culture,  this  shift  meant  the destruction of long-established religious and social structures of the Cham.
* Conversion  of  Religious  Spaces  to  Tourist  Attractions:  Many  Cham  places  of  worship,  such  as  the Hindu Po Naga temple in Nha Trang, have been converted into tourist attractions. Hindu Cham must now  purchase  tickets  to  open  enter  their  own  temples. This  loss  is  not  only  a  tragic  violation  of religious  rights, but  also helps  to allow  Vietnam  to  present  itself  to  foreigners  as  a  place  vibrant  in religious diversity.•De Facto Rules and Stigma on Attire: Traditional and religious attire are de facto restrictedfor the Cham.Cham Muslim women are not welcome to wear Hijab at schools or workplaces .Cham men wearing traditional sarong are ridiculed and mocked by the Kinh majority.
* Government  Control  and  Interference:  Like  all  religions  in  Vietnam,  the  State  controls leadership appointments   and representative   committee sare   under   the   control   of   the   government.   This interferenc ewith  management  and  direction  of  the  religious  activities means  that Cham  religious group sare  guided  by government interests  rather  that  the  will  of  adherents,  scripture,  or  long-held traditions and beliefs. There are no independent groups allowed. 
* Land  grabs  and  Cultural  Rights: In  2010  and  2013  several  incidents  occurred  in  Thành  Tín  and Phươc Nhơn villages where Cham people had conflicts with Vietnamese about the ownership of Kut or  Ghul  areas holding graveyards of  Cham  Bani  and  Hindus. No  sensitively  or  understanding was given  to  the  importance  of  such  sites  according  to  traditional  Cham  belief  systems  regarding ancestors. 
* Attacks  on  Communities: In  2012,  Vietnamese  police  in  Chau  Giang village  stormed  into  a  Cham Mosque  to  take  away  the  electric  generator,  which  used  to  produce  electricity for  around  40 households in the village.
* Economic  Hardship  and  Encroachment  on  Lands: More  generally, Cham  Muslims  in  the  Mekong Delta  have  also  beene conomically  marginalized,  with ethinic  Kinh Vietnamese settling  on  land previously  owned  by  Cham  people  with  state  support.As  there  are  limited  local  economic opportunities, Cham  villages  are  left  with grandparents  and  grandchildren  and the social  and religious fabric of communities are severely damaged 

Admittedly, so far the persecution of the Cham by the Vietnamese government is nowhere near as brutal as what the CCP does in China (at least, this is what we know. Vietnam is a Communist State after all, and they could be hiding many things). However, this is due to the fact that most of the Cham were already genocided long before the Communists reunified Vietnam on 1975."

Its just says to cover your bodies so that others cant make out its shape and think about you in a sexual way.

1126,f8n0d2s,"**Hijab by country**

The word hijab refers to both the head-covering traditionally worn by some Muslim women and Islamic styles of dress in general.

The garment has different legal and cultural status in various countries. In the Indonesian Aceh province, Muslim women are required to wear the hijab and all women are required to do so in Iran.France has banned overt religious symbols, including many religious headcoverings, in public schools and universities or government buildings. Kosovo (since 2009), Azerbaijan (since 2010), Tunisia (since 1981, partially lifted in 2011) and Turkey (gradually lifted) are the only Muslim-majority countries which have banned the hijab in public schools and universities or government buildings, while Syria banned face veils in universities from July 2010.

Now that you ""know"" these places exist, I never claimed that the majority of Muslim women are legally forced to wear a hijab. I just simply stated it's not true that they're free in every Muslim country. It's important not to exaggerate when you are seriously debating or claiming something. I wanted to point out your argument still stands even if you didn't distort the facts, so why do something like that? And your second paragraph is just completely unnessecary. It has nothing to do with what I claimed. Actually read my comment and try to understand what I'm saying."
1128,f8xaunn,"&gt;We Muslim women are not forced to wear the veil. It is a choice.

Are you familiar with the hadith regarding the origin of the hijab? Umar wanted the verse about the burqa revealed. Yes, a human, wanted a verse ""from Allah"" revealed.

&gt;The wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) used to go to Al-Manasi, a vast open place (near Baqi\` at Medina) to answer the call of nature at night. \`Umar used to say to the Prophet (ﷺ) ""Let your wives be veiled,"" but Allah's Apostle did not do so. One night Sauda bint Zam\`a the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) went out at \`Isha' time and she was a tall lady. \`Umar addressed her and said, ""I have recognized you, O Sauda."" He said so, as he desired eagerly that the verses of Al-Hijab (the observing of veils by the Muslim women) may be revealed. So Allah revealed the verses of ""Al-Hijab"" (A complete body cover excluding the eyes). [https://sunnah.com/bukhari/4/12](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/4/12)

Umar even bragged about it. [https://sunnah.com/urn/41650](https://sunnah.com/urn/41650)

Until then, I'll roll my eyes at the hypocrites who wear it with fake lashes and skinny jeans and use their voice to silence those who want to talk about how oppressive it is while the VAST majority of muslim women are forced or pressured to wear the crap, and the people who waste time on defending it as a choice. Out of all the problems with the hijab that's the real issue that needs to be highlighted and talked about, really?"
1130,f9kgt91,"Okay this is beyond sick. As a Muslim, Hijab wearing (Proudly before someone comes here to tell me I am oppressed) woman this infuriates me to no bounds. They took everything that we want to reform about the patriarchal cultures and made it a fetish? Is there anything that isn't demeaning to women that they won't fetishise? And newsflash for them, they probably think Islam is more accepting of these degenerates because of the misleading stories in Western media like Transgender rights bills and shelter homes in Pakistan, State sponsored SRS and HRT in Iran, general empathy among the masses, there is a huge difference between their definition of transgender and ours. 

In Pakistan a transgender refers to children born intersex, hermaphrodite or with genital ambiguity. They are abandoned by the parents out of ""shame"" and they are reduced to selling their bodies or begging. Thats who the rights bills, quotas in government jobs and universities, right to choose your own gender, not for some dude who one day wakes up and decides he's a woman after exposure to Crossdressing and pornos. There are provisions for people who weren't born with any genital condition to change their gender but only after a strict panel of psychologists and physicians certifies there are medical or psychological reasons for allowing the transition and then a civil judge makes a ruling in court. ""Dress go spinny, gimme tiddies"" won't fly in there, nor would your crossdressing stories how you'd steal clothes of your sisters etc. In Iran they have similar views on assessments before allowing the transition. These ""transwomen"" would be seen as nothing more than homosexuals in dresses which is illegal, not as what we see as transwomen. Our Prophet instructed us to be kind to Mukhniseen i.e. The intersex people, while specifically on these people he forbid men from dressing like women and women from dressing like men. That's the category they belong to, not the Mukhniseen. Its really offensive to see them wanking themselves on our cultural heritage, for something Muslim women are getting attacked every single day in the West.

And can I just point out how laughable is this fetish about landing a ""Strong, muscular, religious Muslim man""? Any religious Muslim man wouldn't touch them with a 50 ft pole. But I really shouldn't have expected sanity. Dude is fantasizing about giving birth to ""sons"" lol."

Those who are forced to wear it, by an individual or society should be able to search and find happiness the way they want."

THE majority of Muslim women in Malaysia wear the hijab not because they want to but because of the need to look modest and avoid negative perception, a study found.

In a survey conducted by Sisters in Islam, 80% of 675 respondents all across the country between the ages of 18 and 55 agreed that they struggled to fulfil society’s expectations.

On the projected image of Muslim woman, 59% of respondents said are publicly shamed and morally judged by their appearance.

The survey found that 90% of the interviewees concurred that the hijab is a must for all Muslim women.

“However, there are different opinions where 73% of them believed that Muslim women can still be seen as modest although not wearing the hijab.” said the survey report Perceptions and Realities: The Public and Personal Rights of Muslim Women in Malaysia, released today.

The report said 49% also agreed that one could still be a good Muslim if one did not perform the prayers.

The report stated that Muslim women are conditioned since early childhood to fulfll the demands of society.

“The majority of the respondents stated their experiences growing up under pressure with the perception that as female Muslims, they have to be good and wear appropriate outfits to uphold the family image.”

The survey found that 78% of the women interviewed said their parents were overprotective, 75% felt they were not given the freedom to decide, while 70% said they might be accused of misbehaving if they did not listen and 68% stated that their parents refuse to allow them to be independent. – October 15, 2019"

1139,f4oj8ix,"I couldn’t agree more! I think especially in this new Trump era, the hijab is seen as a political statement made to spite bigots. But really it’s just a patriarchal and oppressive tool made to limit women and police their bodies. Every time I see 2 year old little girls (and they’re usually Somali) wearing a hijab it breaks my heart. They’re barely walking but here they are wearing a hijab. And Muslim women are the first people trying to make the hijab seem like a choice. It might’ve been for them but for a lot of women it’s not. I’m still a hijabi (by force) and I’m an atheist.

It's pretty much like wearing a cross pendant for christians. And muslim women are (mostly) not forced to wear it, they just do it because it's a part of the customs that naturally come with the faith"
1141,f52i1jd,"And they are practicing Muslims? lol I've never met a practicing Muslim that would say that. Either they are ignorant of their own religion or they aren't Muslim but ""identify culturally"" as one, which is the same as not being Muslim. I've met ""Muslims"" that do not pray, drink alcohol and go clubbing on the weekends. That's not who I am talking about.

Either way, the assumption that all Muslim women are forced to wear hijab is still the premise you are pushing and it's false. If you want, this conversation can be continued in /r/Islam"
1142,f550d1r,"Maybe the issue here is the idea of 'being told'. I think people no more want to take orders from others and this tradition is slowly going out of fashion, for both men and women. At this point in human evolution, we all crave for a rather high level of autonomy &amp; individual freedom.

A very interesting example of this is happening right now here in France, where 3rd wave feminists are protesting for their right to not cover up and three blocks from the same street muslim women are fighting for their right to cover up and wear hijab."
1143,f586gbu,"And the country we're talking about in this article is...? 

Some Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab by their parents, society, mosques, etc, that's true. Some women choose not to wear it. There are also women who choose to wear the hijab voluntarily, either as a fashion statement or because they have chosen to follow the religion. It's a free country and you can't just generalise all Muslim women to fall under the same category when we know nothing about the circumstances of this particular girl."
1144,f59e6bm,"Right so dont sarcastically make it seem like Muslim women are going to be punished and ridiculed if they don't wear a hijab, especially in the US."
1145,f5b7tqf,"Even there you get white women who have never met a Muslim woman telling you how badly Muslim women are repressed because of hijab. You also have the some Muslims are good, but Muslim and Middle Eastern countries are very bad people and the people who don’t believe that Palestinians have any right to their homes. It really grossly crosses all political spectrums. Even in social justice groups that deal directly with cultural appropriation and things there’s always someone who wants to argue that they have a right to things like tile mosaic styles from Abassid mosques because they belong to European museums now or that they can wear keffiyeh because it is in “solidarity” even though their solidarity was purchased from a textile factory outside of the Middle East."
1146,f5onnpv,In any religion you choose how strict you follow it. I think some Muslim women are so strict you only see eyeballs and others don’t wear the hijab.
1147,f5ztdoe,"Thank you so much. I want to be your friend too. As a fashion professional I made my knowledge available in what is going on with Avery abc just how Muslim age behaves in those terms in another thread. 

Basically she does not cover their very holy and one if the most basic rules when it comes to modesty. Like I said on this other thread ... she wears way too much makeup, worries too much about it, about the type of hijab etc. True Muslim women are not supposed to be that concerned about making a fashion statement of any kind. The religion in fact preaches the exact opposite. She was wearing a golden hijab on the reunion of what I like to call ... look at me hijab “ain’t” I pretty?! The dress was way too body forming- not only you could see her curves you could see her underwear lines. That’s a HUGE NO NO. And then to top it off she was showing her legs. The dress was too short to THEIR standards. 

I’m willing to bet Omar had lots to say when he watched the show and saw all that. He probably could not tell all that while she was sitting but once she got up and starting moving around it was obvious about the dress. Also believe he had a lot to say about her running her mouth. 

She’s going to go do against their beliefs to a point he will tell her she’s making a mockery of their faith! Just watch"
1148,f67mnc3,"Visual zinah is the most comedic thing I’ve heard all morning. 

To answer your question, yes, Muslim women are human who commit sin. Why? Who knows. Maybe they struggle with their deen due to trauma. Maybe they don’t feel the need to wear it just yet. Maybe they know they should but can’t bring themselves to do it. Maybe they never plan on wearing it. Maybe they can only wear the hijab and not conceal their figure but they know it’s better than not wearing the hijab at all.

As for why the men in their life are “allowing” it, (Not sure why you’re looking to the men in their life to control their actions but that’s a whole different conversation) it could be because they respect the woman’s choice to decide what she wants to wear. Maybe they would like the woman to wear the hijab sincerely for the sake of Allah when she’s ready and not because she’s forced to. Maybe they know they’re not perfect Muslims either and can’t judge a fellow Muslim for sinning as we all do. Maybe they couldn’t care less what she’s wearing and are more focused on the other obligations of Islam. Maybe they understand it’s not always easy being auto identified and stigmatized based off your appearance in ever interaction you have and know they can never tell somebody to deal with something they’ve never dealt with themselves.

I hope that helped."
1149,f68v9nx,"Some women are empowered by showing off their bodies and feeling free to expose themselves. Other women are empowered by modesty. Most of my Muslim friends say that they want to be respected and seen for their minds, not their looks. They also like keeping tradition alive- you probably have some traditions that other cultures would find odd too!

People who say Muslim women are oppressed by their fathers or whatever are full of shit. In America Muslims women choose to wear the hijab because of its spiritual meaning, because they feel empowered, and because it’s traditional. It’s not an oppressive tool here"
1150,f6cw0qx,"It isn't.

Why do you feel displaying religious signs of any kind is appropriate when representing the state? Don't you believe in the separation of church and state? Or do you falsely believe Muslim women are obligated to wear the hijab under all circumstances?"
1151,f6vrlbd,"Okay.. So we are free to choose whatever we think is ""stylish"" and Muslim women are not allowed to choose Hijab as a styling accessory? Or even as a religious statement?"
1152,f6w6r0q,"**Hijab by country**

The word hijab refers to both the head-covering traditionally worn by some Muslim women and Islamic styles of dress in general.

The garment has different legal and cultural status in various countries. In the Indonesian Aceh province, Muslim women are required to wear the hijab and all women are required to do so in Iran.France has banned overt religious symbols, including many religious headcoverings, in public schools and universities or government buildings. Kosovo (since 2009), Azerbaijan (since 2010), Tunisia (since 1981, partially lifted in 2011) and Turkey (gradually lifted) are the only Muslim-majority countries which have banned the hijab in public schools and universities or government buildings, while Syria banned face veils in universities from July 2010.

1 muslim women are punished legally for not wearing the hijab

2 white women are not punished legally for wearing the hijab 

Which of those statements is wrong."
1154,f0fjkb6,"You clearly haven't been listening to how much violence and terror Muslim women are subject to in the white supremacist west. Many have stopped wearing the Hijab because of threats of violence and intimidation.

There is no law in Pakistan regarding Hijab. So I don't know what you're talking about."
1155,f0l3zh1,"Pretty sure Muslim women are forced by their ""husbands"" to wear the hijab and the niqab and the burqa so other Muslims don't see their hair or nose and rape them. Women are property according to Islam."
1156,f0ljcql,"Yes. Defenders of misogynistic religions (and major religions such as Hinduism, Christianity, Muslims,Judaism, Jainism etc.) are misogynists. Period. But, it's necessary to point out that Quran doesn't actually command a woman,let alone girls, to wear veils. So, any form of defense/promotion/glorification of veiling = gendered Islamophobia (as it's a gendered practice with a lot of misogynistic baggage and far-right wing politics). Of course, Quran like other religious books, e.g, Bible, Gita etc. are problematic/misogynistic and women have no duty to follow these books. But, when it comes to veiling, Quran is actually the innocent pary. Guilty parties are the heteropatriarchal men who wilfully and deliberately misinterpret Quran and their handmaids/foot soldiers. So yes...the glorification of veiling is an act of misogynistic Islamophobia and gender based violence. 


https://www.learnreligions.com/quran-require-women-to-wear-veil-2353510


[Quran is very clear about the dress code for the believers. Innovations and fabrication intorduced Hijab (veil) to Islam (submission.) Hijab (veil) is a traditional, not religious head cover that dates back to ancient civilizations, and is not supported or advocated by the Quran](https://submission.org/Dress_Code_1.html). 












&gt;In either case, defense of any misogynistic ideology (such as patriarchal religions, including Christianity, Islam, etc) or practice (such as the veil in this case, or various misogynistic prescriptions in the Bible, etc) results in immediate irrevocable ban. There is no intermediate step to that, no Automoderator temporarily removing comments.

Thank you for having this policy. 

Indeed, Muslim feminists who are critical of veiling, are routinely being branded as Islamophobes/ conservatives (nevermind that the very practice of veiling is rooted in far-right male supremacy politics. ) by imperialistic white woke people. I have seen people comparing Iran's forced veiling laws with Denmark, France and other European countries' burkha ban (in reality, only face veiling, a practice that is very rare among Muslim women, are banned. No European country actually outlawed hijab, head covering.). I have also seen white atheist people supporting school girls' right to wear hijab, comparing white, non-Muslim pro-veiling protesters with those jailed Iranian activists."
1157,f0ubgod,"I have no issues with hijab as long as it's a woman's choice. Unfortunately many ( not all) Muslim women are forced by their families to wear it or they'll shun or disown them. 

Muslims like you keep ignoring this fact."
1158,f0w3tkz,"I think your advice will be deeply appreciated in r/Exhijabis. And I think the fact that you're being a ""business hours only"" ex-hijabi makes it more poignant because many girls can't unveil completely because of family and obligations. Not many ex-muslim or muslim women are lucky to be 100% hijab-free by choice.  


I'm looking forward to reading your stories, questions and advice there :)"

1160,f0xpcki,"Hey u/BlackHumor, we fixed ~~your~~ our post

&gt;we kinda wish people would stop depicting all Muslim women as hijabis.
&gt;
&gt;This is a little like depicting all Christian women as dressing [like this](https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/wkmBOspEycolS9zpEvYX9hb8OR8=/970x0/filters:quality\(85\)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WZNP5JB44NECVF4MSMWTQPQMZY.jpg), or depicting all Jewish women as dressing [like this](https://modli.co/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/found-on-pinterest-tichels-jewish-headcoverings.jpg). Most Muslim women don't wear the hijab. Islam doesn't require that women wear the hijab. It's true that more Muslim women wear the hijab than Jewish women wear the corresponding Jewish headcovering, but this is largely because more Muslim women are religious than Jewish women. (And of course, plenty of Christians wear a cross or other Christian symbol, but we rarely see them depicted like that unless that's the point.)

we are a bot"
1161,f0zsi92,"It's a fact because it's just common sense, and the hijab is not an argument whatsoever because Muslim women are trapped in a system of brutal oppression the likes of which women in developed countries do not experience. 

You SJW's are insufferable, you literally can't recognize when someone is on your side. 😂"
1162,f1eqa03,"Most attractive Muslim men have has sex before marriage. That's a given. Walk to any Muslim Student Association event, or even Pakistani Student Association and 90% of the ""Muslim"" guys there have a white/black girlfriend. If a girl even TALKS to a guy, she is labelled as a whore so I doubt this guy that it's impossible to find an attractive and ""pure"" woman. Im sure 90% of Muslim women are virgins before marriage because of how strict our parents are with us and how society (Muslim men) label us if we do ANYTHING other than sit down, be quiet, and wear an abaya. Even smiling at a guy would label us as a whore to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is in college and he tells me most Muslim guys have lost their virginities already and make fun of Muslim girls who ""don't wear hijab right"" or wear tight clothes. Double standards."
1163,f1gdfdc,"NTA - You are perfectly within your rights and the limits of what can reasonably be expected in your household. From what I've read in the comments, people who disagree don't understand one or more of these things:

1. Your daughter is staying with you temporarily as (it seems like) a guest. It is common courtesy for her to take you and your wife's beliefs into account while staying in your household. 

2. You are not asking her to convert to Islam, or to give up alcohol, pork, or dating/sleeping with people completely.  You are only asking that she not do these things in your home, which is not in any way unreasonable.

3. You have other children in your home, not to mention you and your wife, who would be made very uncomfortable if these requests weren't taken into consideration.

This isn't completely related to the question, but I've seen some comments talking trash about the fact that your step-daughters wear hijab so I'd like to say this:

NOT ALL WOMEN ARE FORCED TO WEAR HIJAB (a headscarf). In fact most Muslim women are not, and wear it of their own free will and choice, for various reasons. It can be worn to feel closer to Allah (God) and their religion, for modesty, or even just because *gasp* they like it. (What?! There are people who actually enjoy covering themselves?? Not everyone likes to show off their body? And they can still love themselves and the way they look? What a fascinating concept!)

The passive aggressiveness of that last comment is directed solely to those who denounce hijab without talking to someone who wears it and/or knowing much of anything about Islam. If you genuinely just have little/no prior knowledge about hijab or Islam I am totally open to kindly answering questions you may have :)"
1164,f1hnkor,"You cna still wear jeans and cute dresses! At home or around your girlfriends or even under your abaya. Ithe hijab is there so that no randomer can get to enjoy your cuteness without you giving your consent!

You can't use hijab as the reason why you feel like you don't have a personality. Hijab is like a blank canvas, *you* need to add the colours and the stroke. The great thing is, you don't have to explain yourself to any dick Tom and Harry but only to people you want to. Because to the rest of the world you're ""just a hijabi"" but to those who know you they'll be able to describe you with way more adjectives and not even mention ""hijabi"" in them.

You can get a job, there's nothing hara about that, the real world is shades of grey and we as Muslim women are just trying to navigate it and make the best decisions for ourselves.

I don't think you need to think about marriage right now, you need to first come to like yourself! Find yourself and meet some fun ladies to spend time with!

Sorry my advice is a bit all over the place. I'd love to talk more. It's just I'm writing this in a rush. Please feel free to pm me or anything."
1165,f1hxhxz,"You do realize for muslims the head scarf is much more than that? If we were to follow your little ultimatum and they most likely choose to wear the headscarf. For many Muslim women it's not an object of sexism. For many Muslim women it's an identity and it makes them feel comfortable with who they are. You don't know what his wife and step daughters value and what is important to them. 

His wife and step daughters have the right to be comfortable in their own home it's not a sexist rule if it's to ensure that those Muslim women are comfortable. You don't know if he's ""so concerned to have them cover up"". It could be his wife not comfortable with older men coming to her home. Regardless these are all assumptions from me and you. We don't know the exact reason behind these rules because we don't know OP and his family. 

Maybe it's a little too strict and if she is seeing someone maybe letting the household know about it in advance would be an easy solution but you are jumping to the assumption that he's a dictator at his house. If we can jump to assumptions OP has stated he converted to Islam. You think someone who converted to Islam would be so easy to adopt the very strict rules and sexist culture that many Muslim men are guilty of? Tbh converts from my experience converted to a culture because of the good stuff they learned about it and connected with. A crazy strict bigoted Muslim man would probably force his non Muslim daughter to wear a hijab in his home and have more than 2 rules for the household. 

Instead of assuming the worst in people maybe try to be more understanding about others with different values."
1166,f215p95,"It's a strategy of the extreme right to paint those opposed to Law 21 as extreme. The law is discriminatory. Muslim women are already being turned away from teaching jobs because o their religion. At the same time, white, francophone police officers get away with sexually abusing aboriginal women in the North.  I bet Muslim women would not abuse minorities like this. It's clar where the problem lies here, and it's not Muslim, female police officers wearing a hijab."
1167,f25urg1,"1) Not all Muslim women everywhere aren’t treated as equals at all times.

2) The simple fact that Muslim women are treated oppressively systematically doesn’t make the hijab oppressive by association. Muslim women also do lots of other things - is everything work by said by or done by a Muslim woman now a symbol of oppression?

So what's your point? It still doesn't make wearing a symbol for oppression justified


&gt;2) The simple fact that Muslim women are treated oppressively systematically doesn’t make the hijab oppressive by association.

Well yeah it does because they're only wearing it because they're Muslim, and female.

No? Lol.

You seem to understand this when you say no lol derisively to a question worded in such a way to enable you to understand the fallacious error you’re making. Well done. My fault for not being more obvious.

You see - if the only criteria for the hijab being an oppressive symbol is that it’s worn by Muslim women and Muslim women are oppressed then anything at all that is exclusive to Muslim women is then a symbol of oppression. The argument is essentially tautological. It’s circular. Hence the nonsensical question I asked. The hijab itself is a symbol of the Muslim faith. The countries belonging to the Muslim faith posses sexist structures for reasons that aren’t intrinsic to Islam. Cleary women can wear the hijab and not be oppressed. So it’s not necessarily a symbol of oppression.

women in all countries are oppressed because women in all countries experience sexist structures. White women in NZ wear makeup and earrings. Are they symbols of oppression?

The article is talking about the hijab yes!! Well done! The point is that people don’t express these arguments in the analogous ways I drew. Which highlights either an inconsistency in application, or an inconsistency in thinking. It’s the latter."

I don't care if what they do is uniquely Muslim. From an outside perspective it's sexism/oppression plain and clear. It's important to stick up for what's right (i.e. basic human rights).

Correct, which openly concede to oppressive/sexist themes. 

&gt;The countries belonging to the Muslim faith posses sexist structures for reasons that aren’t intrinsic to Islam. 

Ok, very debatable , even though Islamic faith is what these people live and breathe by. To say it doesn't massively influence would be ridiculous. 

&gt;Cleary women can wear the hijab and not be oppressed. 

Ok don't bullshit. How many woman would willingly wear one (not born into islam). Maybe 0.005% of the Muslim populaton? 


&gt;women in all countries are oppressed because women in all countries experience sexist structures. White women in NZ wear makeup and earrings. Are they symbols of oppression?

Ok once again you're going off track, and again that oppression is not as sinister as Islam 

&gt;The article is talking about the hijab yes!! Well done! The point is that people don’t express these arguments in the analogous ways I drew. Which highlights either an inconsistency in application, or an inconsistency in thinking. It’s the latter.

1171,f31qncf,"I wasn’t denying that a lot of Muslim women are forced to wear it. Unfortunately, it happens. However, that is a result of people coming from a patriarchal culture and also don’t understand the religion correctly.

There is nothing in the Quran that states this, it is a completely societal choice."
1174,f338jah,"&gt;In recent times, the resurgence of the hijab along with various countries’ enforcement of it has led many to believe that Muslim women are required by their faith to wear the hijab. In this informative talk, novelist Samina Ali takes us on a journey back to Prophet Muhammad's time to reveal what the term “hijab” really means -- and it's not the Muslim woman's veil! So what does “hijab” actually mean, if not the veil, and how have fundamentalists conflated the term to deny women their rights? This surprising and unprecedented idea will not only challenge your assumptions about hijab but will change the way you see Muslim women.

1175,f3a3vem,Yes...Hundreds of millions of Muslim women are wearing the hijab and ALL of them are being forced to do so by religion and men...it is a well known fact that no Muslim women have the intellectual capacity to think for themselves and need big strong men like you guys to think for them and make decisions for them.
1176,f3jlcdv,"I love this post but I don’t think the women is a Muslim, Muslim women are required to wear the hijab (and I know some don’t) so i don’t think she is Muslim, upon this in Islam a Muslim man can be in a relationship with a non Muslim woman however a muslim woman cannot be with a nonmuslim man. Hope this clears everything up"
1177,f3q45l6,"On the one hand yes, on the other hand fuck off and let people have their religion. Most Muslim women are sincere believers and wear the hijab because they want to. Forcing people to behave the way *we* think progressivism looks is for the auth left."

That eternal hell fire awaits women who are ""promiscuous"". Not to mention how closely linked muslim circles are, a Muslim girl in a 1st world country can get into a lot of trouble if she is seen in public without a hijab by a family friend or relative. Im a closet ex-muslim in a Muslim family, but go ahead, tell me more about Islam"
1179,ex0ldc3,"this sub is so harsh thats for sure

1180,ex72ysk,"Burqas are not my country's culture, and we are a predominantly Muslim country. In all my years going to the gym, I've seen plenty of Muslim women wearing sports clothes, albeit long pants and long sleeves so they are covered up. They usually wear the hijab too. But this is the first time in my life seeing someone dressed like this at the gym, and since it's not forced her, then it's her own choice and it's a growing 'trend' to follow Arab style of dressing even though we are NOT Arabs. Don't be so innocent to think all Muslim women are forced. A good number of them do it freely, to become more 'pious' and then impose this style of dressing on other women who don't want it, and the trend to dress like Arabs is increasing her even though it was never our culture. Trust me, if she was being forced by anyone, it might be her own husband or male relatives who were nowhere to be seen at that gym. If she was alone and didn't like wearing that, then she would have changed. But she didn't.

Since it was likely to be her choice, to me, it is a stupid as women wear a long flowing dress to a gym. All she needs if got that thing to get caught in the treadmill resulting in a nasty fall and injury."
1181,exd8m20,"Hi. I noticed you're confused about some facts, and this seems or have led you to hatred and bigotry. Hijab is not a reminder of subservience to all men. Muslim women are not subservient to all men. Women are equal in Islam and in Indonesia l. Hijab is not compulsory in Indonesia and nobody gets beaten or arrested. Indonesia is a secular country. Men have even more strict requirements pertaining to dress. Hijab is not required by Islam. Indonesian women wear hijab because they want to. I hope that helps you empathize."
1182,exf7x7o,"I think this comes from several sources, though obviously this is all anecdotal and my own philosophising etc.

\- Native vs diaspora approaches to the issue. Especially with things like the hijab I think that for women who live in diasporas this can be a matter of cultural identity, while for women who live in countries with compulsory hijab it's the opposite, it's forced and cultural compulsion with real world and often violent consequences. You see a lot of this with so much of the ""cultural appropriation"" dialogue, like American-Japanese people condemning white people wearing kimono while Japanese people say they're happy for their culture to be brought abroad. Except here it seems to be the opposite, because I suppose a lot of women living in diasporas have never had hijab or other modesty garments forced upon them; to them it's just part of displaying/claiming/reclaiming their culture, for which they are shamed and Othered by white people/Westerners.

\- People don't want to be seen as bigoted. This also has an element of white saviour paternalism because mostly people on the left don't want to appear bigoted against ideas, cultures, religions &amp;c they unconsciously view as \~inferior or something. Foreign, exotic, whatever. Which ties to:

\- Misogyny, where people are just straight up unconcerned with women's suffering as long as it's not their suffering/the suffering of the women in their culture. Muslim women are subject to so much dehumanisation it's appalling.

\- Cultural relativism, which I guess during the British imperial expansion had a point (the idea of respecting the cultures your country's invaded is, like...the bare minimum I guess???) but now is being used to say absolutely absurd shit like ""FGM is a cultural practice and we shouldn't condemn it""."
1183,exftd6r,"Predictable reaction from a pseudo-leftists after getting caught in his own misogyny.  

&gt; All I'm saying is that you should try to be a bit more nuanced

Broflake, were you to care about nuance, you wouldn't have attacked me with your common misogynistic tactics and you wouldn't have brazenly promoted hijab as something majority of women love. It's laughable at best that you are now advising me to adopt a critical approach while you yourself is indulging in Islamobic misogyny against women. Do you think by claiming ""majority of Muslim women love hijab "" you are not promoting Islamophobia. People like you only care about Islamophobia when it involves Muslim men. Muslim women are sacrificial lambs to you people. You want other people to validate your misogyny, fetishisation, Islamophobia against women. 

Leveling women irrational and uncritical, is also an online misogynists tactics.  

Blocked."
1184,exgd1cx,"I’m gonna call bullshit on that first claim. There are plenty of people who are deeply religious and have committed violent acts in the name of their religion (9/11 for example). Also, multiple holy books, violence is actually encouraged in some circumstances. In the Bible it says a non-virgin should be stoned at her father’s doorstep on her wedding night. The Quran advocates that apostasy should be punished by death. I also never said god was at fault, I don’t even believe god(s) exist. People do use religion and their gods to justify atrocities though.

Secondly, in places like the United States, you are correct, Muslim women are not required to wear the hijab (by the law at least, I could still make the argument familial pressure forces many women to). However, in countries like Saudi Arabia, Islam is the law of the land and it is required for women to wear head coverings because some stupid book says it should be"
1185,exje9g9,"You made so many mistakes.

**Mistake 1**

&gt; They elected that thing out of spite, killed 100,000 people because 3000 of you died, created a counter culture due to a bunch of teenage girls that caused some fucks to go around shoot everything, and all in all, the worst part is that practically everything you use has been build on by the blood of tears of poor people in another continent.

* Accusing someone about something without actually _(a)_ naming it precisely, _(b)_ substantiating that accusation with facts.

As I see it the capitalist Western society isn't the most successful because it leeches from the rest of the world but because it has the _highest_ standard of ethics and thus the greatest support from its population and also the highest level of _work ethics_ known to mankind paired with a climate that rewards creativity and risk-taking propensity more than any other society precisely because it has the highest standard of ethics. /discuss!

-----

**Mistake 2**

&gt; it's basically accepted that you can't say anything [...]

* Generalizing an untrue statement.

You can always say anything, at least in the West. Whether someone else will consider it to be valuable or even true is another story.

----

**Mistake 3**

&gt; It's essentially that you use as abstract and subjective an argument as, ""It's a Symbol of oppression"" against a woman 

* Accusing the general population of an immoral action without evidence

In truth about 95% of the population in the West doesn't fucking care about cloth on anyone's head. I head that very discussion with a Turkish friend yesterday in our lunch break. He is (rightly) convinced that this issue is just something that's exaggerated by media alone and completely irrelevant to most people.

Wear whatever the fuck you want. Laissez faire is a principle of the West.

----

**Mistake 4**

&gt; even though your neighbor believes claims that their tech is created by poor children is ""SJW triggered lolz"".

* Repeating the accusation from mistake 1, pairing it with a strawmanned reaction, thereby accusing the general population of hypocrisy

... when it's really just immaturity.

Most people in an environment and situation in which they could take such criticism as their phones being built by exploiting children seriously would refute it seriously enough. You can expect that over at /r/ChangeMyView. You can't expect that in the floor of a school or the Youtube comments section.

----

**Mistake 5**

&gt; Is a Muslim woman who uses the same tech you do bad because she wears the hijab or bad because she uses everything you do?

* Asking a loaded question.

The vast majority simply doesn't think muslim women are bad, neithor for using tech from China nor from wearing cloth on their heads.

---

**Mistake 6**

&gt; I'm an atheist woman who lives in Pakistan and doesn't really like this place.

* Not enjoying the West as we do.

I live in Germany and frankly while I think the taxes are too goddamn high Europe, the US, Canada and AU+NZ are probably the best places on Earth that have ever existed in the history of mankind. Nothing ever came closer to Utopia and we don't even strife for Utopia."
1186,exke0b4,"I love how people in other threads/sites are saying that the forced hijab trope is a stereotype for a reason, proven by the statistics that they pulled out of their collective Asses which shows that the majority of Muslim women are forced or pressured to wear it. And when a hijabi is overly defensive and satisfied with her attire then she is of course brainwashed or speaking at gunpoint.

Unlike the *enlightened* west of course, where it's not like your skirt can be too long for school, your boss can force you to wear high heels at work, you're forced to undress or GTFO of the beach or like I've literally know dudes who pressure their girlfriends to wear skimpy clothing in the freezing winter. Nope, stuff like this never happens of course, fucking abysmal."
1187,exmkseu,"I apologize that this turned into a wall of text;

I watched the first season of Elite just out of general curiosity, because it was widely talked about, and honestly I think it did a decent job of portraying Nadia.

At the beginning of the series she is constantly mocked and harassed by another female student who insists Nadia thinks she’s so much better than non-Muslim women for being modest &amp; such an affront to women’s liberation, to which Nadia firmly responds that she does not judge any other women’s choices and that she has chosen to wear the hijab for God and under no pressure from anybody. The reason she has to stop wearing hijab at school is because the female classmate complains to the headmistress that it is a show of religion in a secular school and shouldn’t be allowed. If anything, I felt that her early plotline showed how difficult it is to be a religious hijabi in the West whilst facing constant accusations of being oppressed/needing to be liberated.

As for the progression of her storyline, I still think it did a decent job of portraying the conflict between religion and culture that many young Muslim women in the West face. As Nadia was rather sheltered before attending her new school, this is the first time she is really forced to question her own assumptions and values &amp; the clash between her religious convictions and her inner desires. In the last episode of the first season, when her father allows her to continue at the school next year, she informs her that she is not abandoning her faith, but that she is simply in the process of discovering her own identity independent of what her family might dictate for her. I feel like this entire struggle and journey is something myriad Muslim women in the West can attest to having endured.

I feel a bit frustrated reading these comments because it feels as though Muslim women are not allowed to have any independent narratives of our own, any struggles with religion and culture and such, without being accused of contributing to stereotypes of oppressed Muslim women. Why can’t we have complex inner lives and internal turmoil and conflict? Why can’t we struggle with questions of faith and culture and conformity? When most media made by Muslim men today focuses on the issues of young Muslim men struggling to conform in the West, whilst portraying Muslim women as bumbling boring one-dimensional nobodies, I felt it was rather interesting and relatable to have a show that featured a female Muslim character who struggled to reconcile her religious and cultural identities.

As a side note, Elite itself as a show really wasn’t great. But those are just my thoughts on Nadia’s character specifically."
1188,exwqke2,"Muslim women are told to cover their hair when in public. The whole point of the hijab is to reduce unwanted gazes or looks from men. Its not super important for children, and since Kamala is still a kid, I guess she gets a free pass. Besides, most Pakistani women don’t cover their hair anymore."
1189,exwx1ci,"aside from your ridiculous perceptions and generalizations (to say the least), the reality is Muslim women are supposed to tame down any beauty of theirs. so, the hijab is working! 

I find it funny you did just equate muslim women to brown desis, with few exceptions. 

realize when you marry, you will not be seeing a woman in hijab all the time, and she can look like a 'western woman' when you are home. 

in any case, you do seem to have a weird complex."
1190,ey1nai2,Hijab is a symbol of oppression and Islamic supremacism. Wearing a hijab voluntarily is similar to wearing a Nazi armband. So these Muslim women are anti- white supremacy but fine with Islamic supremacy.
1191,ey3s9lv,"I WAS ABOUT TO SAY THIS!!

I love how it ACCURATELY portrays a Muslim family. Like she says hijab is her choice, yet when Guzman comes over, her dad tells her to put it on. When he finds out she takes it off at school, he gets mad at her and disappointed. That was my experience with it too. I told everyone it was my choice even though it wasnt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Read the instagram comments though about Nadia. So many Muslim women are gatekeeping saying her relationship with Guzman is ""haram"" and in promotional posters of her without hijab are making Muslim women so mad saying that Muslim women HAVE to wear hijab. God Muslims are so annoying omg. Let people live holy shit."
1192,eyd82qu,"There is no such thing as a self-chosen hijab. That would be a head-scarf.

Muslim women are often required to wear articles of clothing that cover or obscure their bodies because they may be too attractive. Basically they have to suffer because men apparently can't control themselves."
1193,eyjovmi,"What do you mean the west is obsessed with the hijab? Why do you have this notion that Muslim women are being 'oppressed because of their compulsory prayers'. If you get hired to do a job and you are tasked with something, do you say you're oppressed? You honestly need to speak to more muslim people and ask them their perspective rather than getting your information from biased anti muslim news outlets. just go to /r/islam and ask your question there and get first hand response."
1194,eyl0kqx,"Not as many as you think, lol. Most Muslim women I know don't wear the hijab. The women who live in fundamental Islamic states are forced to wear it.  And even that number is not ""hundreds of million"" , lol. However, there is still a vast number who chose to wear it. Whether they are in a fundamental state or in the Western world. Ultimately, it's their choice. You can argue back and forth if you want. I know what I have seen personally. You don't get to live in the western world, being separated from Muslim-majority countries, and say something about the people who live over there. It's just not how it works. Ultimately, you are incorrect if you consider that ""all Muslim women are oppressed, or ""hijab is a sign of oppression"", lol

My experiences with Muslim women have taught me otherwise. So, excuse me if I'm not a bigot. You are entitled to your ignorance"

There are nearly 2 billions muslims, half of them women. o say that hundreds of millions of women are forced, or otherwise pressured to wear it by their environment is not a stretch. This is what happened when a muslim youtuber took her hijab off.

You absolutely are. In Saudi Arabia Muslim women are obligated to wear an ***[abaya](https://www.learnreligions.com/islamic-clothing-definition-abaya-2004279)***, not a hijab (tho many opt for niqabs). The punishment for refusing to do so is... [nothing](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/19/saudi-dress-code-debacle). In Iran, they are obligated to wear [hijabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOX9O_kVPeo). The punishment for refusing to do so is... also [statistically] [nothing](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/24/iran-stop-prosecuting-women-over-dress-code). 

&gt;You asked for examples. I am providing them.

I asked for examples of where women are being ***beaten and killed*** for not wearing them. You've been unable to do so. 

&gt;Now, when you're backed into a corner and can't accept that your support for hijabs is incompatible with your supposed ""feminist"" beliefs, your cognitive dissonance is resulting in you resorting to insults.

I support women being able to ***choose***. I don't support the enforcement of niqabs/hijabs ***nor*** the prevention thereof."
1197,eyq8blk,Muslim women are also forced/pressured to pray 5 times a day and fast for month in Ramadan. It's not just the hijab and their freedom to leave the house.
1198,eyzdgyn,"I’ve had many Saudi friends here in Australia studying at uni and all wore abaya and hijab. I have never seen a Saudi wear a black abaya in public though. I have also known Saudis who don’t cover and have permanent residence here. I have seen less face covering though and this is for safety reasons from Islamophobia. 

Can we move past ‘hijab = backward &amp; western-style clothing = enlightened’ please? We know that a woman gyrating around a pole in dental floss is not necessarily liberated, nor is a woman in ‘full ninja’ necessarily oppressed. 

Certainly some Muslim women are told by their family to cover but many women like covering up. And some women are told not to cover by their family. Sera common thread? In the west there is legal choice in many things that are haram but it’s up to us to choose what is good for us. And thank God we still have freedom in religion to say: Allah knows best what that is. 

People will respect you if you are confident and true to yourself. The Saudi women who are confident in who they are get a lot of respect, regardless of what they wear."
1199,ez659qq,"Woman here.

To be 100% honest with you, when I think back of my secondary school days (which is year 5 to 12 where I live)... I always WISHED I could have worn something like a burkini for swimming class, although I grew up in an atheist family and in a country, where body shaming is relatively rare compared to the United States. Germany has a huge nudist culture, we have a lot of nudist beaches and lakes, where both adults and children are just casually naked. 

Nevertheless, I personally would have just felt better if I could cover up more. Sure, this might have been a result of the little bit of body shaming that we do have, but still. 

Of course it is problematic when Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab. However, if they choose (!) to wear it themselves, they should be allowed to. I would be livid if people told me to wear less clothing than I want to, it is just as patronizing as telling women to cover up. Just leave those of us who choose for themselves be."
1200,ezceow9,"Paywalled. Title doesn't suggest Muslim women are opposed to Muslim women wearing the Hijab or Muslim feminists are against the Sims doing this.

Can we not erase Muslim women and Muslim feminist voices in these debates? Their concerns should be centered."
1201,ezdsqdx,"&gt;As American women, many of us have an idea of what feminists are; freelancing women with all the sexual freedom in the world. **But this is exactly the problem with American feminism; it is all about sex and the liberation of our bodies.** Certainly, things like abortion and contraception is a part of that freedom, but in today’s society the fight has taken on a much different tone. 

&gt;**Hip Feminist campaigns like Free the Nipple only encourage a gullible behavior of disrespect for our own bodies, leading to everyone else around us disrespecting our bodies as well.**If we want to be respected as women and taken seriously in all our endeavors we should look to a new source; Muslim women. . . .

&gt;A few weeks ago I went to a lecture about feminism- in Islam. . . . After a quick hour and a half, I could not help but think about all our Free the Nipple group representing a trendy feminism and how some trends need to die. I realized we have been conditioned to think that American women are the free and that Muslim women are the suppressed, but this is twisted to me. I finally understood who is really oppressed by a patriarchal society and it is us. Woman who wear hijab have freed themselves from a man’s and a society’s judgmental gaze; the Free the Nipplers have not. They have fallen deep into the man’s world, believing that this trend will garner respect. . . .

&gt;So I urge my Free the Nipple gal pals to take a look at your Muslim sisters and collaborate with them to create a feminism that treats the female body as a temple and not as a toy. Let us see feminism in a different light—through modesty. . . .

I have no words. What the hell is happening over at Huffpo these days?"
1202,ezw9u1q,"You do mention it by proxy though when you’re rationale for them being weak examples if that ‘no one is forced to wear them’, when they are though in a way (and this also is to suggest all Muslim women are forced to wear them); if you want to be a nun, you have to wear a habit. If you want to be a Sikh, you have to not cut your hair and wear a turban. 

Except Muslim women don’t *have* to wear a hijab to be Muslim. As non-compulsion is a key aspect of Islam in the Quran. It’s outlined very clearly. So there’s more freedom to not wear a hijab and still be Muslim than their is in being a nun or a Sikh. In addition Sikh women have been fighting for their right to wear a turban (as they are not supposed to), so if head coverings are themselves oppressive then what about being told you cannot wear one as with women in Sikhism. 

Bottom line is that it is people of compel things, not a text or faith. But people only go after one and politicise one set of people. It’s hypocritical. 
I don’t see anyone advocating for the freedoms of Jewish men and women not to cover their hair with a scarf or a kappa, literally ever. But hijabis cannot even exist without discussions about them being fundamentally oppressed and backwards starting up on every thread"
1203,ezwc0oa,"It's more of a modesty thing. No one has issues with nuns being modest but Muslim women are apparently oppressed when they wear it. Speaking as a brother and a son of 2 women who live in the west and choose to wear a hijab, they just feel more comfortable covered up. No one is forcing them. This is something carried from Mary, mother of Jesus as well. Most depictions of her show her covering her hair. Just because some women don't want to flaunt around uncovered( which isn't a problem either), doesn't mean all women are comfortable with that. 

My sister feels prettier in a hijab. She chooses to wear it. 

Also a plus my mother has avoided skin cancer."

1206,f03csin,"Just because she is not being written in the way you wish she was doesn't mean she is a negative representation of a Muslim woman.  

I've been there. I've been the teenage daughter of immigrants who has felt very torn between two cultures. At that age, it often felt like I wasn't ""devout enough"" for other Muslims kids, but I was ""too Muslim"" to fit in with the local kids. I was questioning whether I wanted to wear Hijab because I hated the way it made me ""feel different"". I had a thing where I really liked a boy that wasn't Muslim and he liked me back and there were times I compromised on principles to impress him. Because I was a lovestruck teenage girl. And that is what lovestruck teenage girls do sometimes. And sometimes young Muslim women rebel. Sometimes they go to a bar because their friends are. Sometimes they drink too. Because Muslims are people, not robots that always act ""perfectly Muslim"". 

Sometimes they choose to take off their Hijabs. And Nadia CHOSE to take it off Sometimes, Muslim women feel free when they take their Hijab off. Sometimes they don't feel free. Because Muslim women are individuals and have different experiences. 

Nadia's story will resonate with a lot of Muslims growing up in Western countries who have been that are or are that age now. And it is just as valid a story as the Muslim who never feels that identity crisis and doesn't get a crush on a non Muslim boy or doesn't ever question their beliefs. 

Again, I think people are asking too much when they want a 17 year old girl to be this perfect representation of Muslim women. Asking her to be so strong in her faith it never wavers and never gets compromised for a boy she likes is something that is difficult for women much older than her character."
1207,f07jjcn,"Muslim women are forced to wear it as they are seen as worthless by men. Nothing about the Muslim cult should be accepted, tolerated or celebrated.

1208,f0841rm,"The fact that you are getting so heavily offended and uncomfortable over a simple discussion that is about whether hairy legs are the main reason of women covering their bodies should tingle your mind a bit

You are heating up yourself, no one said anything offensive and no one attacked you directly. If you can't keep up with something as simple as a civil discussion then just quit replying

That being said:

&gt;  forced to wear more revealing dresses, make up, shaved legs. Heels etc then that is also oppression. **The point is to not tell woman what to do with their bodies** 

The main comment was claiming that the woman that wasn't wearing a hijab and excessive clothes was not free either because she was facing public expectations. Of course it's right, but it's still irrevelant to the photo  
So it means that both, you and OP are missing the whole message of the picture. It's not about whether if women in general are free or not. It's about the fact that many muslim women, are less free than nonmuslim (or non religious) women in general. Muslim women have to worry about bigger things than nonmuslim women.

Now, to answer your other questions:

""Where did I claim that""  
You got offended by me simply debating someone who claimed that, which means that you also share the the same points given in the previous comment.  
You are wondering where does it look like you suffer from mood swings

You quickly go from insulting and getting enraged to acting like if men don't have to worry about what parts they have to hide from other people within the span of 1 sentence as if you were caring

It literally states that islamic women are forced to wear the hijab in accordance with their faith, and those who resist this decree are punished by 55 years in prison. When you are raised under constantly oppression it becomes part of your identity and culture, this doesn't change just because a foreign government and culture tells you it's a choice. They have been conditioned to wear it, which means they will tell you they are very happy to wear it.

1211,etxylpz,"By ""here"" I assume you mean Canada/America. Yeah that's true. We don't really have ghettos or islamist groups.

Desi Muslim women are far less likely to wear hijab or burka, tend to be more educated, and more likely to be employed.

I feel like the UK often gives visas to lesser educated village and folk from Pakistan. That's why there's so many problems with British Pakistanis. The UK also lets Islamist groups roam freely. Canada and thr US don't allow for such a culture to exist."
1212,eu2l2bu,"""I don't want to be considered ugly, but I also don't want men to approach me even more often than usual. It's hard.""

I think we can all relate to this sentiment. 

I understand what you mean about feeling a sort of freedom when performing Western femininity when you come from a background that expects the extreme from the opposite side of the spectrum. Even though you didn't wear a hijab, the same socialization of being made to feel shamed of your exposed skin and female form was equally forced upon you. The hijab is merely a symbol of the control...one aspect of a larger misogynistic ""modesty"" sentiment. Growing up in Western ideology, I think one of our symbols of male control is the thong...it's a mark of womanhood that literally only exists to make us ""whores""...a mark of being under male control, even if they can't see it...we know it's there, and we're sexually available, waiting for one of them to see it. 

I think we as women tend to want to rebel to the extremes of our socialization, even when it's not healthy for us. I tend to notice a lot of privileged white females from religious or repressive ""modest"" backgrounds being the ones to speak out on behalf of sex work and kink (when they don't suffer real life consequences that less privileged women do)....obviously that's not what ex-Muslim women are doing in the slightest, but just acknowledging that there can be the flipping of unhealthy extremes when women rebel against one form of patriarchy and embrace another form. 

Unfortunately, Western society makes existing as a non-feminity conforming woman a brave choice, so of course you want to conform to the beauty standards of the West...we're all expected to and get treated like shit if we do otherwise. And of course, you having to exist in two opposite worlds at the same time is double the amount of oppression, I'm sure making life feel very impossible. 

I'm happy for ex-Muslim women to gain a sense of personal empowerment any way they can, even if by embracing Western feminity standards...women should do what they need to on a personal level to survive in their own way...but of course, on a class level concerning feminism, it will always be essential to fight against all aspects of patriarchy, even if it has some personal value in our lives for us as individuals (relationships with men, performing femininity, etc). For example, I see a lot of the body positivity movement for non-skinny women embracing women of all sizes being models and sex symbols...on one hand, I support it, but on the other hand, non-skinny women aren't going to find liberation through these means. It's a form of non-comforming conformity. 

So to sum it up, women should do whatever they want on a personal level to feel comfortable and survive...not everything we do is going to be feminist in a world built on patriarchy...we just have to make sure we don't lose sight of the ideology and end goal of liberation from all of patriarchy."

1214,eufi1j2,If all we have are these two tweets to go on then I would say theres a slight cause from the hijab comment because it is insensitive because not all Muslim women are forced to wear it. See definitley are and its definitley worth acknowledging that there some countries with really backwards laws where women are forced to wear hijabs. I totally understand and agree with people raising their eyebrows at that tweet.  What I'm saying is that I don't think the black on black crime tweet is racist and I dont think these tweets were severe enough to warrant stripping her of the title. It's the same problem I had with the roseanna fiasco. Why not give them a disciplinary warning first and then scorch earth them if they screw up again.
1215,eupr2ah,"&gt;they

So Muslim women are a cohesive lump, all the same and all lacking autonomy?

That would explain why one friend of mine didn't wear a hijab when I first met her and now chooses to wear one, but a different friend wore a hijab at first but has now chosen not to. 

It's almost like they are people. Yes, there is a definite and serious problem with treatment of women in many parts of Islam and I find that niqabs do make communication less easy, but there is more than one reason to wear an item of clothing it does not mean that you can just make assumptions about why any individual woman is wearing what she is wearing."

She isn't wrong on the cultural appropriation part, but the ""all Muslim women are being oppressed under Islam"" narrative is a bit too much."
1217,eva8t5y,"True. I have a Muslim friend who is also a black woman and she says people are essentially like ""you go girl"" when she speaks her mind while wearing a hijab because apparently Muslim women are supposed to be meek.

When she isn't wearing it and wears her afro out and presents as a black woman, people just think she's an angry black woman when she speaks her mind. 

So many people are just legitimately stupid and biased and don't even realize it."
1218,evb3lx6,"I was born in the US, but moved to and attended 4th to 9th grade in Sudan. Moved back to the US for high school.

The degree to which there is pressure to wear a hijab largely depends on the household. However most practicing Muslim women are going to wear it whether you pressure them to or not, for the same reason that most practicing Muslims won't eat pork or drink alcohol. I think this can lead to a false impression among Westerners about the prevalence of coercion, because in there minds, ""how could any woman possibly want to wear that?""

But no I would never want to dismiss the suffering of any person. I just think there are a lot of people who are not at all familiar with the concept of hijab, and who assume there are no women out there who choose to wear it."
1219,evcopf1,"All I am stating is it’s incorrect to assume the hijab strictly oppresses women. For many, it evokes pride in their ethnic heritage and is counter to the Western perception of beauty. For others, they may feel pressured, same as women of all cultures face varying degrees of societal controls. I just commented on that misconception because I think it’s wrong to assume all these Muslim women are controlled and powerless."
1220,evd36k6,"I choose to embrace the fact that Muslim women are more powerful than apparently a lot of people here choose to believe. As I’ve *already* stated, the purpose of my comment was to point out that the hijab should not be viewed solely as a symbol of oppression because, for many women, it’s not. I think it’s damaging to female empowerment to have such a narrow view on these issues. Never once did I deny some women are pressured into wearing them and even acknowledged it. I’m done following this page because this attitude does not promote female empowerment and, in fact, punishes the various forms it can take for women of different races, religions, and creeds."
1221,evfs69l,"&gt;How many more Muslim women would opt OUT of wearing a head scarf if it wasn't punishable by time in prison?

Do you have statistics on this? Sounds to me that your personal bias is speaking here, rather than hard facts. You are literally just *assuming* that a majority of muslim women are opressed into wearing a hijab.....because why? Maybe *you* can't personally comprehend why a woman would willingly do such a thing, which is understandable considering the MASSIVE differences in culture, however for you to assume your assumptions are true and therefore believe that the ""hijab is a symbol of opression"", is an idea lacking evidence.

I may also may not have any on hand statistics proving weather or not a majority if muslims women want to wear the hijab, but I do have some understanding of the history as well as my personal experiences.

However, it is onus on the *accuser* of a claim to come up with evidence to prove their accusation. Not on the defender.

From personal anecdotes, no woman in my mothers side was required to wear a scarf in Pakistan by their husbands. When my mother moved to live abroad in a non-muslim country, she literally had ZERO pressure from any external source telling her to wear the hijab. However, after she did some research in time and as her faith increased, she learned about the importance of the hijab. So she became a regular wearer of it. Following her lead and teachings, all her sisters in Pakistan decided then to also do the same.

This personal experience may not reflect whats happening in the entire muslim world population. But it does usefully highlight the folly in simply assuming that ""hijab=opression"".

Historically, accounts show that as soon as the decree was revealed that women must cover their hair, the arabian women in Medina were so strict in their observance of Islam that many immediately ripped some of their excess cloth/garments to cover their heads on the streets, ASAP after hearing the revelation. The first Muslim to accept Islam was a woman (iirc). What these historical accounts suggest is, that these women are hard to understand for a modern 21st century western observer. The early muslim women at least, definitely wore the hijab out of their free will. Logically theirs no reason this wouldn't then extend for throughout 1400 years of Islamic history."
1222,evfto33,"&gt;You are literally just assuming that a majority of muslim women are opressed into wearing a hijab.

I didn't assume anything, I posed a question and then continued on specifically disregarding the necessity of that question being answered.

Your reading comprehension leaves much to be desired. You managed a whole wall of text that is already addressed very directly and pointedly by something I've already said. 

&gt;Just because it appears that some amount of people are fine with doing something does not mean that said thing is okay to be dictated by law as a REQUIREMENT.

You seem to be lacking a fundamental understanding about what freedom and oppression are.. It doesn't matter if 99.99% of all Muslim women are 100% on board with a hijab.. If a single one is punished for opting out, that person is being oppressed. When a group of even modest size wants to opt out and is not allowed to, that is oppression, and the symbol of that oppression, in this case, is the headscarf."
1223,evjjybw,"I’m a Muslim.  I’ve worn a hijab for almost 30 years.  There is a reason why Muslim women are supposed to cover their hair.  It’s a sign of modesty.  Muslim women are not the only ones who are concerned about modesty.  I wish more women dressed modestly.  Seeing a woman with her side boobs hanging out and her cleavage down to her navel is kinda gross, IMO.

I think it’s kind of adorable that you cover your hair.  I assume you’re doing it for the same reason that I am -  because you want to be modest.  Your “friends” are being ridiculous.  The hijab isn’t really like the cross, which is purely a symbol.  The hijab has a functional purpose - to cover the hair.  How can you “culturally appropriate” covering your hair?  Billions of women who AREN’T Muslim cover their hair.

So maybe don’t call it hijab if you don’t want.  It wouldn’t bother me if you did - I think of “hijab” as the Arabic word for scarf.  And the word “scarf” isn’t owned by Muslims.  But it is true that the word “hijab” is associated with Islam.  So maybe just call it a scarf.

It seems like a lot of people in this thread aren’t Muslim, and are deciding for me what I should and shouldn’t be offended by.  Which is annoying.  It’s a type of “liberal racism” that implies I’m some sort of wilting flower that can’t speak up for myself.  

Hey, everyone?  I don’t need you to speak for me.  I can do it myself.

Definitely, DEFINITELY NTA.  And your friends need to chill out."
1224,evpf3kh,"I don't have a source, but just for context, there are very, VERY few women who actually wear full face coverings (burqa or niqab). Obviously many non-Muslims consider that behavior to be extreme; what's important to note is that most Muslims ALSO consider it to be extreme.

The most extreme Christians believe in burning prostitutes to death and slaughtering non-believers en masse, because the Bible tells them to. Most Christians don't believe in that/don't subscribe to those parts/claim they're not relevant/whatever, point is they consider those folks just as extreme as the average layperson does. Muslims are no different.

Most Muslim women are fine with banning the full veil because they consider it extreme anyway, and the subtext of banning the niqab/burqa - which barely anyone wears - is that practicing your religion in a reasonable way and wearing hijab if you prefer is totally cool."
1225,evvoohn,"Relevance: Sam's concern with the growth of fundamentalist Islam in the west as well as Islam's treatment of women and gays in muslim countries.

&gt; Three women held in custody for ""disrespecting compulsory hijab,"" or the so-called Islamic dress code, have been sentenced to a total of 55 years and six months.

&gt; A ""Revolutionary Court"" in the capital city of Tehran delivered the verdict to Monireh Arabshahi, Yasamin Ariany, and Mojgan Keshavarz who are behind bars in the notorious Qarchak prison.

&gt; Arabshahi and Ariany's legal counsel, Amir Raeesian, told Ensaf News website August 1 that if the verdict is upheld, his clients would be sentenced to ten years to serve, each.

&gt; The verdict was delivered to the prisoners in the absence of their lawyers, Human Rights Activists News Agency, HRANA, reported.

&gt; The three had been charged with **""assembly and collusion to act against national security,"" ""propaganda against the regime,"" as well as ""encouraging and preparing the grounds for corruption and prostitution.""**

&gt; However, Moqimi told Radio Farda that his client, Mojgan Keshavarz, had merely protested compulsory hijab and had nothing to do with other charges claimed by the prosecutor.

&gt; Ironically, none of the attorneys were allowed to represent their clients during different stages of issuing the indictment, interrogation, and trial.

&gt; Branch 28 of Tehran's Revolutionary Court that condemned the three is presided by a notorious judge, Mohammad Moqisseh, who is well known for issuing harsh verdicts totally based on the reports compiled by intelligence agents.

&gt; Reportedly, while delivering the verdict, Moqisseh told the three, **""I will make you suffer!""**

&gt; Moqisseh is the same judge who on March 11 sentenced the prominent Iranian lawyer and defender of women's rights **Nasrin Sotoudeh to nearly forty years.**

This is what modesty culture brings , thinking that a women is encouraging prostitution if she is not wearing the islamic headdress. I completely understand the left defending hijabi muslim women from the right wing bigots and saying that its a choice for them to wear that. But things have gone to the extreme , the left not only defends their right , which everyone regardless of being on the right or left does , but it goes a 100 step up to glorify the hijab and promote it like its some marvelous thing for women , constantly righting cringey articles on their leftist blogs and news websites about how ""hijab is empowering"" , "" how its a choice"" , "" its a smash against patriarchy"" "" its a symbol of defiance against white colonialism"" and other dumb stuff.

The far left doesnt realize that this kind of islamic propaganda that they promote in the Mainstream media  actually hurts muslim women , especially the one that do not wear the hijab (simply because they are too uncomfortable in it or dont deem it religiously mandatory) , so now these moderate muslim women are expected to wear one to show that they are muslim women , the left has made hijab a part of a muslim woman's identity. Its like if she isnt wearing a hijab then she isnt a ""true muslim"" ironically the same mentality that the islamic imams and bigots hold.

Would the left run this story in their web sites and msm news channels? Would Ilhan Omar tweet about how horrible Iran's regime is for doing this? And how oppressive and barbaric the sharia law of forcing a woman to wear hijab is? Would she tweet that? Fully condemning Iran? Would Rashida Talib or AOC talk about this ? Or is this too politically incorrect?

Its ironic isnt it , to imagine that a day will come when among leftists , feminist circles in the west , talking against a monarchy who force , beat and slut sham women into wearing a piece of cloth on their head (and if they protest they are put into jails and labelled as prostitutes by misogynistic males) would be considered taboo and too non-PC.















This is what modesty culture brings"
1226,evvsapc,"It literally confuse me that in Western countries, the Muslim women are protesting that they should be allowed to wear hijab and here it's the opposite."
1227,evxo4ji,"Hm , when did all the muslims in Iran ""signed up for it"" , did they sign papers to accept islam when they were born in muslim families and just babies?

Do they have a choice to ""un-accept"" islam and apostatize so that these savage rules dont apply to them?

And what about the non muslims of Iran? Non muslim women are also forced and beaten into wearing the hijab in Iran. When did they sign up for that? Why are they forced to comply with the savage morality of muslims when they are not even part of their cult?

By the same logic , do you think uighyur muslims should also comply with the morality forced upon them by the communist ruling part of China? Where they are forced to take of hijab , banned from going to mosques , forced to eat in ramadan and ""re-educated"" in the camps? Should they just accept it cause they ""signed up for it"". Should rohingya muslims of Mayanmar also just accept their genocide?"
1228,ew44kyh,"&gt;Then what happens in the Netherlands instead? 

Beats me. I'm not a Dutch lawyer.

&gt;Citing Wikipedia for a miscellaneous analysis. 

&gt;3 days ago a judge ruled that the killer should simply be fired.

So you're saying that when someone is killed, this is an exception that is faced with legal ramifications, and not standard protocol.

That's what I'm saying. You're not doing a good job defending your point.

&gt;Because it's a misapplied law when it comes to Muslim women and in no way are women harming others by wearing the burqa? 

How is it misapplied? When Muslim women are given the exact same treatment that other citizens are given without discrimination, it's misapplied?

If I wanted to wear a Balaclava, I'm not harming anyone. But I can't. Because of anti mask laws. Same with said Muslim women. They're being treated the same way other women are, with the exact same laws. This is because in the Netherlands, people don't get to break the law just because they want, and the law applies to everyone equally.

Sounds like the legal system doing what it's supposed to do.

As I said. Just as Judy can't wear a Balaclava, Maryam can't wear a Burqa. Equal laws, both are treated the same ways.

&gt;""Kinda arrogant"" no1curr.

Then similarly, ""no1 curr"" about Muslims women who want to break the law. You get treated the same way as other civilians, deal with it. 

&gt;Why does the law exist? Security purposes?

Pretty much. Anti mask laws trace their origins to the early 1900s, as a result of masked riots.

https://www.google.com.tr/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-mask_laws&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjr4fu4u-7jAhWYxMQBHSyfAp4QFjABegQIDRAG&amp;usg=AOvVaw2AmDmpC0nB3S3hltLRwUzP

Identification is a very important thing in Europe. The police and security cameras should be able to easily identify who you are.

&gt;KSA works perfectly despite the burqa

As you say, ""No1 curr""

Saudi Arabia =/= Europe.

&gt;and in no way is this not a stunt to get international attention because there's probably an extreme few of burqa-wearers in the Netherlands.

A law over a century old is not an international stunt because if Burqa wearers in the Netherlands. Yes. 

&gt;""Discrimination?"" No1curr.

The Netherlands cares. As does Europe. Everyone is treated equally by the law. Equality is a big thing in European culture, unlike Islam.

&gt;Want to ban the hijab? That's messed up. 

Banning the hijab, as I said, is stupid. It's basically an overglorified scarf/hat. If you're banning the Hijab, but not hats/scarfs, then it's discrimination. Which is a big no no.

If you want people to follow the law and not wear masks in public, then that's standard procedure.

&gt;Arabs who don't live in the West don't speak Arabic? 

They do. But most I met here on the sub live in Muslim countries.

&gt;Freedom of religion. 

How is freedom of religion being taken away from them? As long as you are not breaking rules, you can practice whatever religion. This applies to all religions. In Jain sects, priests are to go naked. This isn't allowed. In Incan, human sacrifices are standard, this would be illegal. As I said, the laws are applied equally to everyone. You can practice any religion, just don't break the law.

&gt;40 people were killed. A woman was killed. 10 other people were killed. The people in power don't believe in fucking science and the Earth is being destroyed.

Which is a load of problems that should be and are being worked on.

&gt;Thanks to the internet

Wait what? How is any of this caused by the internet?

&gt;Western men screech animalistically about ""Freedom of ideology"" whenever we suggest restrictions on content because they're narcissistic creatures, but the picture changes when a woman wears a burqa and freedom of ideology gets thrown out the window.

Because wearing masks is illegal. It's also illegal to go around naked. Are they oppressing Jains?

As I said, follow any ideology as long as you do not break the law. If your ideology includes robbery, then you're not allowed to do that. The law applies equally to all. If your ideology includes going vegan, then feel free, you're not doing anything illegal.

&gt;A tad bit narcissistic

Says the person who thinks that the law should not apply to a group of people and they should be allowed to break the law, but no one else should be allowed to, and they should be able to break the law because that's what they want to do.

Hypocritic much?"
1229,ewf4iyq,"Yeah I think it's because as a class, Muslim women have to contend with being objectified and oppressed in a way that nuns don't. As far as I know priests aren't a class that experience discrimination either, so bringing that up as a comparison makes you sound really dumb. 

Second, the world isn't just white people in America. Yeah I guess muslim women are pretty high up on my 'woke list'  being that I'm from a MUSLIM BACKGROUND. Did you know since she did that scene 'refugee' porn has soared in popularity in the west? Where desperate Muslims are raped in their hijab. She took money to debase an extremely vulnerable demographic. She's trash."
1230,ewl85zt,"You're doing exactly what she is doing. Are you she?

 Do I have to transcribe the whole video? Her speech is full of deceitful statements, like the one you just made.

""The Quran gives women a lot of rights"". Perhaps compared to pre-Islamic times but to suggest that Muslim women in Iran or other Muslim countries have rights per the standards of today's society is laughable. A couple of the rights that Muslim women have:  Muslim women have the right to have their testimony counted as half a man's. Muslim women have the right to inherit half of what their male siblings do. Muslim women are accused of adultery if they are raped, unless they have four male witnesses on her side.

""I am a young Muslim woman...I have voice...I sit before you... I can look you in the eye ... I can speak to you"". Sure. In the United States she can. Not so much in any Muslim majority country, or even within the walls of many mosques, Islamic community centers or homes in America.

Hitchens says ""I can see your hair...and I can see you in an audience with young gentlemen..."" She lies and says she can. She denies, and at the same time admits, she is required to wear a veil (Hijab).""In Iran my hair would be out."" and then she moves the goalpost ""the veil (that I am required to wear) would be little"".  See OP's link.

No I don't usually call women bitches - just one like this who, given an opportunity to ask a QUESTION, abuses the platform to spew a bunch of disingenuous rhetoric to defend or advance a vile, misogynistic, bigoted, anti-Semitic, homophobic ideology. She is a disgrace to women around the world - especially Muslim women."
1231,erp2246,"&gt; Why are you singling out a hijab? People working for the government shouldn't be wearing visible Christian crosses either.

Therein lies the problem. Christianity doesn't have any rules saying you have to wear a visible cross. Muslim women *are* supposed to wear a hijab, Sikh guys *do* have to wear turbans. So in effect this law only applies to any religion that has rules about clothing, most notably *not* Christianity. So as a result Christians are perfectly able to work for the government without having to change anything at all, whereas a Hindu or Muslim person would have to give up their religion or willingly violate its rules. So in effect this law just bans Hindus and Muslims (""brown people"" to the racists) from working for the government, and pretty much nobody else. Christians are fine, atheists are fine, Jews are fine if they're not orthodox, Buddhists are fine, Muslims and Hindus are not. That seems awfully specific to me."
1232,erxf6m8,They will even tell you that muslim women are free... And when you ask them how ? They either don't have an answer or they will tell you : because they wear the Hijab and hide there bodies. But... We were all born naked. How clothes give you Freedom exacly? That's not an argument.
1233,eryn7y5,"No, you’re arguing that I’m arguing that. If you’re gunna argue with me its better to do it with me than a person you made up.

Your entire argument its assuming these women are unable to informed decisions which they can. Many muslim women are aware of how the hijab has been used in the past and still choose to wear it because its there right.

People are capable of thinking for themselves and aren’t always brainwashed. That’s sociology 101."
1234,erytz2l,"Well when Saudia Arabia, the literal centre of the Muslim world, is also one of the most oppressive countries towards women, it's not hard to see why people think that way. It's easy for Muslims in the west to say ""oh but we don't oppress women, it's their CHOICE to wear the hijab!"" because it's true - it is indeed a choice. But in some countries that are known Muslim states, these women don't have a choice - they can be stoned for not wearing a hijab. They are blamed when they are sexually harassed or raped, because ""her skirt wasn't long enough, how can it be surprising that this happened, she should have covered herself to stop men treating her like that."" 

Actually that's another reason some people would say Muslim women are oppressed. Why do women have to cover up in order to avoid the gaze of a male? Are guys not able to control themselves after seeing a bit of leg, or maybe some forearm?"
1235,es3dww8,"&gt; Yet again you’re generalising. Firstly, not all Muslim women choose to wear the hijab and not all those who do are brainwashed 

OMG where did those women get the idea from to wear a hijab?

 It wasn't from millions of men spouting the idea was it?

 ""if you wear it we won't beat you? ..if you wear it we won't beat you? ...if you wear it we won't beat you? .if you wear it we won't beat you? . on and on and on.. and that is exactly how brainwashing works

so that in your reply is where I am going to stop you from misinforming people

 because those Muslim women are brainwashed into wearing them and the world choice is merely an anathema where there is no choice at all..

If you put a misogynist in power then he will use that power to forward his male goals and he probably won't suggest women for promotion, cos that is how the misogynists minds works

 women are not born good enough according to the misogynists and their many cults of manhood

and they say if triangles had gods they would be 3 sided but in man's case they are just two faced.

""Yes here is my wife and she cooks and cleans for me, she is a very good wife and she knows her place in our man's world and you know women are cooks but men are chefs, cos we men are always elevated to a higher position at least in our male minds we think we are."""
1236,es9648c,"that's a choice, you ignorant fuck. Muslim women are being oppressed every day. why, in the western world, is wearing a hijab ""bravery"" yet in the middle east ""brave"" women *take it off*? its oppression, plain and simple. people shouldnt be afraid to call out the shitty parts of a belief system. It isnt racist, if your beliefs are shitty your beliefs are shitty. Religion can be changed."
1237,es9fxw5,"A burkini is made out of swimsuit material, they are not just random clothes. The only difference with a bikini or swimsuit is that it covers more skin so I don't see what the problem is. France and oppressive regimes like Saudi Arabia are now two sides of the same coin. Forcing women to take off clothing and abandon a part of their identity is just as bad as forcing them to cover up. Either way the woman doesn't get to decide, the choice is taken from her. 

Additionally, many argue that the hijab and burkini ""oppresses"" Muslim women as if banning religious clothing will ""save"" those women. It won't. In fact, it makes it way worse. By banning the hijab or burkini you are restricting and denying public access to women at worst and making women abandon a very meaningful part of their identity at best. The reason many give for supporting the ban is that they believe many muslim women are forced to wear it by their spouse or family. Women who are being forced to wear the hijab won't magically be allowed to take off the hijab by their families if it's banned, they just won't be allowed to go into public. In families that FORCE their daughters or wives to wear the hijab (which is against Islam and more about control and culture) the ban will only mean that the women/girls will no longer be able to participate in the public sphere or  go anywhere where the hijab is banned. This means no school if it's banned there, and in this case not being able to go to the beach/pool and swim. You're not doing women in these toxic and controlling situations (which again is against Islam) any favors, you're just making their cage and access even smaller. So now that Muslim women who are actually being forced to wear the hijab are ironically forced out of the public sphere by a ban meant to ""liberate"" them, that leaves Muslim women who aren't being pressured by family members and instead CHOSE to wear the hijab/burkini despite the stares and islamaphobia they knew they would face because it's important to them. You're now forcing those women who made a personal, independent decision to take off a very meaningful part of their identity. How is forcing women to take clothing off in order to be allowed in public any different than forcing women to cover themselves to be allowed in public? Both don't denote freedom since choice is taken out of the equation. 

If a woman wants to wear a sexy bikini and feels empowered by it she should have the right to. If a woman wants to wear a burkini and feels empowered by it she should have the right to. Everyone's definition of empowerment differs and true freedom comes from the right to decide for yourself. I know Muslim women who want to wear the hijab because it makes them feel beautiful, close to God and is a part of their identity but are too scared to in the West. I know that France hails itself as being very secular but how is a Muslim woman joyfully swimming with her family while wearing a burkini negatively influencing others? Secularism doesn't mean intolerance, it doesn't mean ignoring the fact that other religions exist and forcing members of that minority religion to abandon their identity.  Doing daily activities in public such as swimming with your family/friends isn't forcing your religion down others' throats, it's just existing. Are Muslims to be penalized for existing in the public sphere in France? An actual free society would have a Muslim woman in a burkini, a sikh man in a Turban, and a Christian woman with a cross necklace all coexisting together and having fun at the beach."
1238,es9ht5c,"It is simplistic and naive to assume that most women wearing burkinis (or hijab more generally) do so because they are being forced to. I would like to see some statistics on this, but my gut feeling is that the vast majority of them would defend it as their own choice. They would feel genuinely uncomfortable showing too much skin to strangers. You might call it cultural conditioning, and I wouldn't disagree, but the fact remains that the government is trampling upon these women's right to dress as they wish, for no good reason. That is the moral side of the story, at least for me. From a practical perspective, the ban makes even less sense, as I tried to explain in my post: it does no damage at all to the ultra-conservative Islamist ideology it is supposedly targeting -- it actually bolsters it. You make a whole community angry and disenfranchised and ripe for exploitation by hateful imams because why? You don't like seeing covered women around. The more subtle approach would be to let those women wear whatever they want and instead focus on the next generation through education. It is not a coincidence that France has the most trouble with its Muslim minority. In the Netherlands, where I have spent some time, I see that younger Muslim women are much less likely to wear hijab than older ones, and they seem quite comfortable mingling with non-Muslims. That is what we should be striving for: inclusion, not confrontation."

France, to the Left, has always been one of those cities upon the hill which can guide us to some socialist glory hole, yet France bans the burka and the headscarf? Could you imagine the US having a similar ban? The feminists would be the first to erupt in protest. Now, what do these same feminists think of the other side of that spectrum, where women want to express their freedom by uncovering everything? Whose side do they take when it becomes combative, as it is in France, where Muslim women are protesting for their rights to wear the burka while some women are pushing for public nudity?

Yes, we have already ascertained that you need to reread things several times to understand them.

&gt;And it is. After reading it I've arrived to the conclusion that you dumbasses are suggesting that Muslim women who wear the hijab are oppressing Muslim women who wear the hijab by wearing the hijab

It's more like Muslim women by donning the hijab, are oppressing non-Muslim women as well as Muslim women who don't wear the hijab. How difficult is this to understand? Can't you honestly represent your opponents views instead of resorting to childishness? Ad homineums aside, you really are very bad at arguing your point. Cut the insults and get straight to the point. 

&gt;let's all stop wearing T-shirts because to some kid it represented the time her father raped her!

Women in the Muslim world get harrassed for not wearing the hijab. Women in the West don't get harrassed for wearing T shirts. Ergo, false equivalency. 

&gt;Still doesn't prove Muslim women are creating a virgin/whore dichotomy? 

Now you are just being wilfully ignorant of my argument. Do you even know what a modesty culture or rape culture is? You pretend to be a feminist but can't even grasp this simple concept. 

&gt;And that you got this out of your ass? And if the hijab, or the shirt in analogy, does symbolize the oppression women receive by men, I still don't see why non-associated women should be policed again? So the fuck what? Blame men, you idiot. 

Men and women are complicit in building patriarchal structures. Women have built modesty cultures supporting foot binding and FGM. The hijab is no different. It's like I am talking to a teenager at this point, who can't understand that women have agency. 

&gt;But then you show me your own mental gymnastics to tell me I should blame women (because donning attires oppress people, yo!)

I am blaming both men and women. But, let's be honest, reading comprehension and debating honestly is not your forte."
1247,eoao2t7,"&gt;Modesty cultures create a virgin/whore dichotomy. You can read manuals by Islamic scholars such as Maududi, or Noman Ali Khan which praise the hijab by demeaning non-hijabi women.

The women on your TV-screens aren't enforcing a modesty culture. 

I apologize if men are using everything women do to build the patriarchy. I'll dig out my uterus to show my solidarity in-fact, because men use preganancy to oppress women. And I'll screech at every pregnant women I'd see for embracing the patriarchy and help building it by being pregnant. 



&gt;Yes, we have already ascertained that you need to reread things several times to understand them.

I believe that understanding my opponents arguments instead of repeating my arguments of a misunderstanding of them like an inane fool is counter-productive. You, on the other hand. 

&gt;It's more like Muslim women by donning the hijab, are oppressing non-Muslim women as well as Muslim women who don't wear the hijab.

Every collective female American is oppressed by hijabis on their TV-screens. Everyone offended by Muslim women are oppressed because all of them claim oppression. Jews, right-wingers, men, feminists, non-Muslim women, Indians, exMuslims, even women from fucking Iran, are oppressed by hijabi women. 

I think, that if I were in your shoes, I wouldn't justify my screeching by claiming oppression. I'd find an actual reason to use for justification.  


&gt;How difficult is this to understand? Can't you honestly represent your opponents views instead of resorting to childishness? Ad homineums aside, you really are very bad at arguing your point. Cut the insults and get straight to the point.

Granted, I have no idea what you're shitting about. I said that Muslim women on your TV-screens who probably haven't enforced a lick of modesty culture aren't oppressing people who can just claim oppression. 

From what I've gathered, you're triggered and using Muslim women to *do enforce the hijab* synonymously with the women I support, and you're repeating it over and over again for some reason.

 You are also having this wacko freak theory pertaining to a conspiracy where Muslim women who wear the hijab support men who want to rape non-Muslim women, apparently because men respect hijabi women and not non-hijabi women (unsourced by the way, obviously enough). 

And you got this whole ""symbol of oppression"" spiel brewing on for you as seen by your OP-EDs which I don't bother to care or address because I don't care.  

So Muslim women are oppressing both non-Muslim women and other Muslim women because men oppress them.  Ergo, women on your TV-screens are oppressing you. 

 Granted, this could be your argument and I'm just having trouble believing anyone could actually believe this, so I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt. But admittedly, I have no fucking certainty what you're incohorently ratting out. I guess that instead of making a decent argument your pretentious format of quoting people and then accusing them of being liberal apologists, hijab apologists, Islam apologists or trying to stifle criticism of Islam might muddle the waters for the very confused other party trying to read through you being a dumbass. 

&gt;Women in the Muslim world get harrassed for not wearing the hijab. Women in the West don't get harrassed for wearing T shirts. Ergo, false equivalency.

I guess that everyone claiming to be oppressed, including non-Muslim women, might not be following the brightest of ideas then.  

&gt;Now you are just being wilfully ignorant of my argument. Do you even know what a modesty culture or rape culture is? You pretend to be a feminist but can't even grasp this simple concept.

Pregnancy is rape culture. BDSM and kinks are rape culture. Porn is rape culture. Sex work is rape culture. Men using women's choices or state of being is rape culture and women should stop if they don't want to be oppressed. 
The End.

1248,ep0g76k,Assimilating should be a choice it should not be forced upon you.  “Subjugating” I think there is a cultural prejudice where you are assuming that Muslim women are forced to wear a hijab or niqab when they’re living in a western country. Being a Muslim living in the US Muslim women are often discouraged from wearing it to not bring discrimination or unwanted attention upon themselves. What I’m saying is that a Muslim woman wearing a hijab or niqab in a country where she is not required to is a very conscious and personal choice. It’s done with the understanding that you will be getting looks all day and you will be subject to discrimination from a random person in the street making rude comments to the doctor seeing your sick child. I think that’s wrong. If a women makes a personal choice to wear a hijab the assumption should not be made that she is somehow forced to wear it or she is rejecting western culture or not assimilating enough. I never see people being up in arms about what nuns because it’s seen as a personal choice and part of the “culture”. I personally think the niqab is a bit much but I’ll defend whatever choice a women chooses to wear or not wear on her body.
1249,epbuuwj,"The thing is, I'd be less inclined to think its oppression if I knew with absolute certainty that there was no external force pressuring women in Islam to wear hijab and cover up. But speaking from my own experience (and i live in the West, so I can only imagine what its like for women living in Muslim majority countries), even if no one is threatening you with violence, there still exists a very real pressure to subscribe to Islam's version of modesty. And that fact makes me think hijab brainwashes people, or it forces people to wear it who otherwise wouldn't wear it if they had absolute freedom to choose. If, in another world, a woman would face no repercussions for not wearing hijab, and she had not been indoctrinated into Islamic views on modesty from an impressionable age, and she still wanted  to wear the hijab, then I could look at that and say, ""That's not oppression, that's freedom of expression"" but that's not the reality. I think Muslim women are the biggest group of victims when it comes to Islam. It's literal brainwashing. Muslims try so hard to get girls to wear hijab at an age young enough that the girl won't ask any questions, and eventually when she gets older, she'll just wear it out of habit, mindlessly. And then they grow up and do the same thing. It's an endless, vicious, sad cycle."
1250,epjv6fy,"From what I’ve learned with my friends, mainstream Muslims are no more “anti-woman” than Catholics are.  

The hijab gets a lot of hatred by Christians, and is used as “evidence” that Muslim women are subjugated.  But the hijab is kind of like rosary beads are to Catholics.  For most Muslim women, (in countries where women enjoy relative equality, that is) it is a choice to wear it and is done so as an outward expression of faith.  Mennonite women wear caps and skirts, as do Amish.  Traditional Mormon women wear a specific style of underwear that follows scriptural guidance.  Muslim women aren’t any different from women of other religions. Some choose to wear a hijab, some don’t."
1251,epk7x0t,"Wut?

In this story the woman complies with the request and it’s the father who wasn’t there who later makes the complaint because he was mad.  The woman was in complete control of herself at that time but her husband was offended.  The husband was the problem whether the woman had been brainwashed and coerced to wear restrictive clothing all of her life or not.

This is not at all about her uninspired and in all honest, false, modesty and everything about his misogyny and patriarchy.

Not all Muslim women are in favor of hijab.  Not all think it is right to let girls burn inside a school because mutawa won’t let them out without covering.  They have White Wednesday every week in Iran where they protest mandatory covering."

People came for Jackie Aina (and rightfully so) when she did that ill-advised halal/hijabi makeup video, so why isn't anyone allowed to question this?

She also complained that her 55+ year old son had never married and “refused to have grandkids for her.” So this customer was looney tunes on many levels."
1255,eqkd9h1,"&gt;We are not talking about Muslim states, though.

I am not, I am providing a point of reference. Key difference. 

&gt;To be clear, you are actually arguing that women who chose to wear the hijab in Sweden are somehow responsible for sexual assault.

Sounds like someone doesn't know what a Madonna/whore complex is, and what it means for women. Read up. Yes, women wearing the hijab contribute to a rape culture - I made it perfectly clear in the above argument. Alternatively, a quick google search reveals numerous videos about how Muslim preachers and imams, many of whom live in the West, extol hijabi wearing Muslim women to the detriment of non-hijabis and non Muslim women. Examples include. [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ1-vrLSe7Y) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AALgGKSnU2g)[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUpnXpoi6XM)

&gt;To clarify: You are promoting rape culture because instead of solely blaming the perpetrators of sexual violence, you chose to go out of your way and blame women who chose to not display their hair in public. You blame them for sexual violence that is inflicted on others.

You didn't understand what rape culture was two posts ago, and you are trying to school me on it? This is absurdly laughable. Please read up on what rape culture is, and then come back, otherwise you sound absurdly ignorant. 

&gt;Furthermore, you seem to be unaware that Sweden is pretty much the best place to be if you are a woman - on the planet. Not only can you find employment opportunities that are unheard of elsewhere (e.g. in the conservative parts of the USA where you shamed, mocked and denigrated if you chose to focus on your career instead of only breeding like an animal) but also have a huge amount of resources to support you, both private and governmental.

You are being a bit hypocritical here. For one thing this is moving the goalposts to discuss the U.S. Two, even in the conservative U.S, attitudes towards women are far more enlightened towards the role of women, than the *average* in the Muslim world. Three, many of the attitudes you bring up, about women being shamed mocked or denigrated if they focus on a career instead of ""breeding like an animal"" in your words, are more common in the Muslim world, and *even in Muslim communities in the West*. 

&gt;There is no better place to get rid of your hijab, if you so desire, than Sweden. None.

Except, as I mentioned, Muslim women are generally living in Muslim communities where the marketplace of choice is weighted. For a single Muslim woman, yeah sure living in the West is the best place to remove the hijab, and many do - but most Muslim women aren't single and unattached. That's still rare. 

&gt;We are not talking about ancient times, though. It's telling that you have to fall back to ancient time to make an attempt at an argument.

I am talking about the purpose of the hijab. Which I will be honest, you don't even know. Do you know the context of how the verse of the hijab was sent down? Or the circumstances? Or Umar's role? I doubt it. If anyone is ignorant it is you. At least, I don't pretend I am enlightened like some people. 

&gt;That, and blaming random Swedish women for any sexual violence occurring in their vicinity because they... cover their hair.

You are arguing in circles at this point. I already addressed this, and tbh it sounds like you barely read my argument nor could comprehend it. 

&gt;Go ahead and be offended now! Wild shit!

Grow up, you disturbingly ignorant man."
1256,ensf9z1,"It is oppression when they are not allowed to forgo wearing the item of clothing in question. Duh. Women in western society are allowed to forgo wearing skirts and dresses, and in fact, women who wear skirts and dresses often wear pants, too. Islamic women are not allowed to forgo wearing the hijab -- those who wear a headscarf generally do so daily without exception. Why? Duh. Because they have to under their religious rules."
1257,ensgouv,"&gt;  Islamic women are not allowed to forgo wearing the hijab 

They are though. It’s less a purely religious thing and much more of a hybrid religious-cultural thing. I’m sure you’re aware many Muslim women don’t wear hijabs. 

&gt; -- those who wear a headscarf generally do so daily without exception. Why? Duh. Because they have to under their religious rules.

Okay then, I’m going to need you to provide evidence of this. Just because they wear it most times doesn’t mean it’s oppressive. With other clothing as examples, most everyone wears a shirt and pants (or some similar variation) all the time. We don’t call those people oppressed. 

Again, we’re talking about headscarves. I’d be in closer agreement with you if it was niqabs or hajibs but it’s not. It’s a ban on women being able to wear a goddamn scarf."
1258,el5gc0h,"Muslim women are known to stick trash all up in their ~~hijab~~ [slave scarf](http://magaimg.net/img/7ac7.jpg) to make their [""hidden"" hair look bigger](http://magaimg.net/img/7j34.jpg), like [empty yogurt cups, toilet paper rolls, and even Pringles cans.](http://archive.is/QrqQO)"
1259,el8ee3w,"Symbols mean different things to different people. Just because to you, it's a symbol of oppression, it doesn't mean that that's the case for the ones that choose to wear it.

My point is, different people have different opinions on it. You might disagree because you felt personally affected by it. That's fine, and I guarantee that in some countries and families, it is forced upon women. But let's not generalize and pretend that all Muslim women are oppressed and forced to wear certain things.

At the end of the day, you're saying the hijab is oppressive because women are forced to wear it (which is true for some, but not all). Is it not equally oppressive to tell people that they cannot wear certain things of they hold certain government positions, despite the fact that those clothing items have absolutely no impact on their abilities to do their jobs professionally?"
1260,el913zy,"I kinda wish people would stop depicting all Muslim women as hijabis.

This is a little like depicting all Christian women as dressing [like this](https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/wkmBOspEycolS9zpEvYX9hb8OR8=/970x0/filters:quality\(85\)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WZNP5JB44NECVF4MSMWTQPQMZY.jpg), or depicting all Jewish women as dressing [like this](https://modli.co/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/found-on-pinterest-tichels-jewish-headcoverings.jpg). Most Muslim women don't wear the hijab. Islam doesn't require that women wear the hijab. It's true that more Muslim women wear the hijab than Jewish women wear the corresponding Jewish headcovering, but this is largely because more Muslim women are religious than Jewish women. (And of course, plenty of Christians wear a cross or other Christian symbol, but you rarely see them depicted like that unless that's the point.)"
1261,ely1qze,"&amp;#x200B;

So do you think it's ok and reasonable to call a stranger a postbox or a robber? 

Our muslim woman is not islamophobic, however she may be intolerant. It's the idea of forcing your views onto another, that's my issue. If she wants a sensible debate as to the pros and cons of the veil within a progressive societal structure, then she can fire away. If she wants to strip someone of their veil because *she wants to,* then that's patently wrong.  Extremism breeds extremism, breeds extremism. 

You seem to think that all muslim women are forced to wear the veil, which is just not the case. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2eLBYl-j0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2eLBYl-j0)

I agree there are may well be loads of cases women are forced to wear the burqa / hijab / niqab - please refer to my second sentence, above.

I say again, we need to be able to look at these issues with logic, not emotion."
1262,em14xsa,"**Hijab by country**

The word hijab refers to both the head-covering traditionally worn by some Muslim women and Islamic styles of dress in general.

The garment has different legal and cultural status in various countries. In the Indonesian Aceh province, Muslim women are required to wear the hijab and all women are required to do so in Iran.France has banned overt religious symbols, including many religious head coverings, in public schools and universities or government buildings. Kosovo (since 2009), Azerbaijan (since 2010), Tunisia (since 1981, partially lifted in 2011) and Turkey (gradually lifted) are the only Muslim-majority countries which have banned the hijab in public schools and universities or government buildings, while Syria banned face veils in universities from July 2010.

1264,em5rylt,"First off quit with the all caps, its ugly and and makes you look like an idiot. Second is that what Nuns are wearing on their head and what Muslim women are usually wearing (hijabs) are the same thing. Most hijabis traditionally just wear it like this woman here which is just like how Nuns wear theirs but maybe not as tight all the time. In other countries like Africa the style changes on how they wrap a hijab around thier head and honestly those look pretty cool but back to the point and purpose of the hijab is that as long as it covers all head hair its fine."
1265,em83410,"People should leave Muslim women the fuck alone. Ayaan Hirsi Ali wouldn't receive an ounce of contempt compared to this random model and the former *voluntarily* (indoctrination isn't a choice) supports Kavanaugh. We all can see there's bias against Muslim women in Western media. 

There is no inherent problem with the hijab; lots of cultures have scarves. It's the way Muslim women are socialized in oppressive manners that is the problem. This random lady isn't socialised that way and definitely isn't advocating for such socialization. Literally no one associated with her supports that socialization.  Leave her the fuck alone."
1266,em9i17c,"This doesn't bother me at all. I think it's important to be able to see a face in public. And face veiling is NOT required in Islam, at least according to most Muslim scholars. The hijab is fine and doesn't cover the face. What is often ignored is that a lot of Muslim women are oppressed by these types of policies. If ANY religion told me I had to cover my face so that members of the opposite sex aren't tempted I would be out so quick. But they can't leave. At least not with their lives. So yeah, ban niqabs. And in a show of solidarity with them I promise not to wear my ski mask to Wal-Mart anymore."
1267,emdo76e,"So you been with an Afghanistan girl. I could have probably said nuns are known for being celibate and you would retort with how you bedded one of them too.

I attended mosque with a lady from the Sudan and when her husband called for her, she cutoff mid-conversation and left. This woman almost literally jumped at his command when he looked at her and said ""time to go.""

I studied Arabic with another woman who would not let her daughter associate with any one outside of Islam, nor date. It was strictly school, home, mosque. Rinse and repeat. The only fun this girl had was at Eid.

I've also seen Iranian girls without hijab. But most of them are Shia if I'm not mistaken and the real crazy is with Sunni because most of Islam is Sunni and the fundamental wackos are Sunni.

But sure, let's pretend Islam is not the best option for a man who wants a wife he can control and one more likely to be faithful.

Seriously,  I think you are making things up. We now have multiple cases of honor killing in the west and websites for Muslim men looking for a second wife and imams performing nikah ceremonies for polygamist unions. All of this is in the west. It is a culture within a culture with its own laws.

So you can't sell me on the idea that Muslim women are just as slutty as Western women.

You can't guarantee anyone's fidelity. All you can do is go with the least likely to cheat."
1268,emgkg6b,"&gt; There is none. The reasoning behind this prohibition isn’t any more “scientific” than the reasoning behind requiring women to wear hijab.

Exactly. So Muslim women are simply expected to be more modest according to the teachings of Islam. In the West, it's keep at least your bra and panties on in the workplace and in the Middle East, it's keep only your face, hands and feet visible. Peterson is somewhere in the middle."
1269,emy07fg,"Ad hominems aside, your argument is really poorly made. Firstly, if you largely agree with me, why post? Secondly, I have given a list of hijab within the context of other rape cultures. The underlying logic is not too dissimilar. It creates a dichotomy between pure women who wear it and impure women who don't, and excuse Muslim men who assault the later. I don't know what more to expand on this for you, as if you don't think this is problematic, then you never will and are not really pushing for feminism. 

Moreover, your nonsensical ties to white people and exmuslims shows how clueless your argument is. White people and exmuslims aren't oppressing Muslim women, Muslim men and Muslim women are. 

What does teach your animals civility even mean? Or desperate from them? Really now? You know Muslim patriarchy is one of the strongest the world over, and segregating Muslim women and men doesn't stop assault. It never has.  Lets be honest here, you can't have gender equality within an Islamic framework, anymore than a bird in a gilded cage is free. If you want sources, I can add them, but it really doesn't get any simpler than this."
1270,en354oe,"The prohibition about cutting hair, at least in my denomination, had a rather insidious principle behind it. We're all familiar with how Muslim women are usually expected to don a hijab in order to be ""covered."" That same principle of being ""covered"" is why we had to grow our hair out in my church. Essentially, because women were considered lesser (read: second made, first fallen) they had to be under the authority of someone, usually the father, husband, or god himself. Therefore, instead of having a physical covering of cloth or a hat, the long hair served as a covering, as Paul admonished in his misogynistic letters. It makes me want to wretch just thinking about it."
1271,en4rxe3,"I have 2 answers.

1. No I am Pakistani-American Muslim. (my parents were born in Pakistan but I was born and bred in America.)

1281,ej1vv2p,"This occurred to me, too. Yes, the hijab is traditionally worn by women, but it's also traditionally worn by Muslims. If non-Muslim women are being asked to wear it in solidarity, there's no reason the same can't be asked of non-Muslim men."
1282,ej237mb," 

&gt;I don't normally do this but I couldn't help myself after seeing this[ 'movement' online where non-Muslim women are being encouraged to wear hijab/scarves](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-shooting/111411345/kiwis-encouraged-to-wear-headscarves-to-support-muslim-community.) to show 'solidarity' with Muslim women.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a Muslim woman myself, I think this is nothing but cheap tokenism. **It's a gimmick and pretty distasteful.  You can't help a Muslim woman with a photo**.  Many  people have also talked about men wearing scarves and others about  whether people can still go to the pub for a drink with their hijab on.  It is a mockery.  
&gt;  
&gt;Someone said: ""It's ok, let them help how they want, they want to make  us feel like we are one of them"". Why 'them'? We shouldn't have to be  'them'. Some Muslims have been in NZ longer than some Pākeha but yet  they're still not Kiwi enough.  
&gt;  
&gt;Muslims here have been so deprived of support that they are willing to  accept any and every kind, whether it is racist, culturally  appropriating or just misplaced and misinformed.  
&gt;  
&gt;**This also stinks of white saviour mentality, where Muslim women need to  be rescued by (largely) white folk. This type of ideology plays a part  in the pyramid of white supremacy** and must be acknowledged so people can  stop virtue signalling and understand the impact of their actions.  
&gt;  
&gt;We don't want to be turned into a caricature.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please do not support something as stupid as this.

Oh snap. Get called out as white supremacists, all you hijab wearers.

Kudos to Stuff for publishing this savage dressing-down of selfie activism."
1283,ej492s4,"I just read, all the non Muslim women are wearing hijab in honor of “Muslim call to prayer”....WHAT THE HELL?!?"
1284,ej4byhi,"What is your specific view of repression? You can't be judgy of certain things since there are more than a billion of us. 

Women repression? That is unheard of in my country(majority muslim) women are respected dearly we call them our sisters and the hijab thing is not a common thing and not a requirment, most don't wear it, and when they do it's just a full on scarf thing,Saudis whole ninja-face hijab is ridiculous it doesn't represent the idea of the hijab at all.

gay rights ( the quran considers gay acts only as a sin) what a state does to inforce it's power through religion like Saudia Arabia, it's totally incompatibile, if you wanna see modest islam views you can turn to Turkey, Albania, Bosnia, hell there is even a large majority of us in China where muslims are being repressed.

I advise you to go visit a mosque or at least talk to a muslim. There is a really huge difference from what you see in media and the reality itself. "
1285,ej6jqf6,"I would also like to add that I know that some Muslim women are not forced to wear hijabs. I am a girl student in high school (and living in Christchurch) and I know a schoolmate who's mother was shot and killed. Yesterday (Friday) I saw women wearing hijabs, including my fellow students, and I could not feel that they could be slightly naive to the true reasons why women wear hijabs (which is to keep ""modest""), and I know I might sound like some crazy woman here, but it seems like a form misogyny. If a woman wants to wear a hijab, go ahead, I'm all for freedom of choice &amp; speech. But the fact is, is that the Qur'an tells women to dress modestly, and that restricts women. I just wish more women (Muslim and non-Muslim) knew the true reason why the hijab exists. "
1286,ej7fxfn,"That’s the problem with you lot though isn’t it? You lot shoot each other up all the time and do nothing, this prime minister reached out to a global community and had an appropriate response to a horrible massacre, and you deride her for wearing a hijab. Pathetic. Also 1.5 billion Muslims, not all wear hijabs, and not all Muslim women are oppressed but ya you can look at that to make you feel better if you want whatever. "
1287,ej7ued0,"&gt; You lot shoot each other up all the time and do nothing

We do something which is not taking away rights to idiot proof our country.

&gt; you deride her for wearing a hijab. Pathetic.

Only because people have been all over Reddit comparing her decisions to what Trump would hypothetically do.  How the two things are connected, I don't know.  Trump is an idiot, but parading this woman around doesn't prove that.

&gt; Also 1.5 billion Muslims, not all wear hijabs, and not all Muslim women are oppressed but ya you can look at that to make you feel better if you want whatever.

Right, but the ones who do have to wear it can't leave their houses without it.  Of course, people in the privileged west aren't going to face consequences for wearing/not wearing them.  Why didn't all the men get circumcised to show solidarity?  "
1288,ej81mag,"&gt; Can we talk about how patronising it is to imply Muslim women don't have any choice regarding what they wear?

Most Muslim women do not wear it out of choice and are shamed into doing so. The few who do and are loud and proud about it are doing the bidding of their male overlords seeking to normalize a patriarchal religion in the minds of gullible Westerners.

&gt; Plenty of Muslim women do choose to wear hijab and openly talk about how proud they are, good thing you're here to put them down. 

Regardless of how proud these Muslim women are, the hijab is a form of Islamic modesty culture. They wear it not out of piety, but out of religious belief that men's boners will go haywire if they don't. This is rape culture plain and simple.

There are plenty of sex workers that are proud of doing what they do despite knowing full well that their ""sex worker activism"" is funded by pimps and sex traffickers. That doesn't make it okay."
1289,ej9qz2z,I love how in their minds Muslim women are both empowered by the left agenda and oppressed by their religion. It's Schrödinger's hijab.
1290,ejh1cch,"Why are you so low confident in your natural human morals (specifically about adoption). I personally don't care about scientific miracles bla bla bla. Because Quraan is Violent.  Islam says to kill ex muslims, islam says it's forbidden to be gay. Islam says women are less than men in so many ways. Islam says men can marry 4 women at the same. Mohammad married a child. Islam encourages enslaving women laterally and in the way even Muslim women are treated as ""free"" in Islam but in reality they are only submissive to their male guardians. Why should i worship a god that wants to burn me in hell for the little of little sin i make?? Why are the men in Muslim countries more monstrous when it comes to sexual related stuff than countries were women wear whatever the fuck they want. Isn't Hijab is supposed to prevent that??


Come on dude your human values and your morals are more important than the mind gymnastics you are playing with yourself with those so called miracles. "
1291,ejhzf0s,"Of course it does, not only because rules, but proper hijab actually makes you look older and uglier, there is also common stereotype that all muslim women are married. But, I was surprised when I actually found out there are ways to look pretty wearing it, check some fashion hijab accounts in instagram. I personally just wear an ugly version and glad that males ignore me, but it's more because my unfriendly behavior."
1292,ejnk2cq,"I keep seeing these nationalists talking about how ""anglos"" don't understand the principle of secularism.  We understand.  Lots of ""anglos"" probably agree with it.

The problem is, most of us see this ""secular"" law for what it is - a sop to people who can't stand the idea that their society might evolve and change.  It's a statement to religiously observant Quebeckers that this society does not belong to you, and you have no part to play in its power structure.  It tells them they are no longer allowed to see themselves reflected in that structure but must remain at the mercy of it.  You can go to school but you can't teach.  You can appear in court but you can't be a judge.  Don't like it?  Yank off that silly hat.

Obviously, the nationalists see it as a coincidence that the believers most affected will be Muslims, Jews and Sikhs, and not the observant among the white francophone majority.  That majority has decided for Muslim women that the hijab is a symbol of oppression, after all, so they're actually being helpful - just explaining how the views and practices of millions of Muslim women are backward.  Of course, any ""anglos"" who dare express their disgust over this policy, and attempt to explain their reasoning, are cultural supremacists.

The Charter, of course, is in place to prevent the tyranny of the majority, a majority that in this case will cast aside fundamental rights and basic dignity for the sake of political expedience.  S. 33 was Pierre Trudeau's greatest failure.

So when it comes to ""laïcité"", yes, we get it.  It's not that complicated.  We just don't like it."
1293,ejoi9ed,"My professor, a Yemeni ex-Muslim, is the one who told me it was borrowed from the Old Testament. So far as I recall from my Arabic minor, I can’t recall a phrase in the Quran which states that the hijab must be worn. 
If this is false information, then I apologize, but so far as I know, it is true. It may be in a Hadith and that’s where the confusion comes from?
Hijab is of course something Muslim women are expected to wear, but in my experience not all do and niqabs seem more region specific. I saw lots of niqabs in Saudi Arabia and saw much less in Morocco."
1294,ejpqi30,"They certainly have had rights taken away. Before, a Muslim woman had  the right to control what  was on her body and to express her religion freely at work (or not) with a hijab. The Quebec government has taken away that right from Muslim women. 
You have a right to think that Muslim women are silly and inferior to you and that your religious beliefs are superior. You are allowed to believe the same about blacks, gays, transgender people, and all women. People with those beliefs are the reason we need a Charter of Rights in case people with these beliefs wish to translate these prejudices into discriminatory action and get politicians, bureacrats, and the police to take them away from racial, ethnic, religious, and gendered individuals.  "
1295,ejqzalo,"&gt;Okay you didn't answer my question. 

Then I guess it’s even, because you still haven’t answered the question I asked you in my very first comment to you:

&gt;we have those laws for the same reason that Muslim women are required to wear hijab: to mandate female modesty in public. Why is it okay when we do it?

Are you having trouble thinking of a reason?

&gt;Take bras as a general term for breast covering. 

No, I’m not going to do that, because “bra” is not and never has been a “general term for breast covering”. "
1296,ejr0eab,"&gt;&gt;Okay you didn't answer my question. 
&gt;
&gt;Then I guess it’s even, because after two comments in response to mine, you *still* haven’t answered the question I asked you in my very first comment to you:

It's pretty obvious to me there's a huge difference between breast covering and hijab, burqa and others. It's political and historical context. I am curious if you don't see the difference or just like playing devil advocate.

&gt;&gt;we have those laws for the same reason that Muslim women are required to wear hijab: to mandate female modesty in public. Why is it okay when we do it?
&gt;
&gt;Is that because you are having trouble thinking of a reason? 

No. 

&gt;&gt;Take bras as a general term for breast covering. 
&gt;
&gt;No, I’m not going to do that, because “bra” is not and never has been a “general term for breast covering”.

Wow why are you being so rude and evasive? Either have a meaningful conversation or don't waste my time and yours. When I say ""take bra as a general term"" I mean for the sake of my argument. Obviously."
1297,ejsxwuz,"&gt;  I have lots of sympathy for all the beautiful Somaali girls forced to wear it, all that beautiful timo jilaac hair covered under the hijaab. 

I don't think the hijab is bad because women should have to show their ""beauty"" to please men like you the hijab is bad because it's justification is rooted in the control of women, rape culture and the objectification of them. I don't know why some people like criticise the hijab based on the idea that women should show their beauty I know one guy who said it's a shame muslim women are oppressed by hijab and that they can't show their beautiful sexy legs. It's ridiculous.

1299,ejuvyqw,"NONE of this discredits what I had already said to you. I've already said that some Muslim women are pressured. Again, that does not equate to it being a legal or religious requirement.

1301,ejwrac3,"It's rarely ever a real choice. If it were, Muslim women wouldn't wear them anymore than Christian women choose to be nuns. Muslim women don't have a special brown woman connection to a piece of fabric that they wear on their heads to avoid the male gaze. That is grooming. And not all Muslims are brown. The word ""Islamophobia"" is very weaponized. Islam is not a race or even a culture. You cannot be racist to Muslims, since Islam is not a race. And you absolutely can criticize Islam without being accused of being prejudiced to Muslims. It's the same as Christianity. People criticize Christianity but they are not being prejudiced to every single Christian. Either they take issue with the ideology itself, some aspect of it, or some specific people who align with the ideology. 

Muslim women are groomed to wear the hijab (at best), and at worst, they are forced to. But a hijab is the least of some Muslim women's problems..."
1302,ejyjro3,"But you're not the one who prescribed hijab. Islam did. Muslim women are wearing hijab for Islam. Islam's opinion on the matter obviously matters a whole lot more than yours does.

You mean facts.

1304,ek608oz,"You’re literally just homogenising all Muslim women as ‘forced’ to wear something and reducing them to passive subjects without any agency. Are you fucking serious? 

You’re literally a moron. There is 0 empirical validity to the claim that all Muslim women are forced to wear hijab and actual experience in Muslims communities would also have shown you how simply untrue that is. I love how you think you can speak for billions of people and have some supreme source of knowledge claims to the realities of other peoples lives when in reality you’re getting this stereotypical and homogenous view of an entire culture and its people from media and nothing else. "
1305,ek72wzf,"&gt;Her wearing a hijab was a statement of respect and solidarity. 

Many of my  Muslim friends consider bowing down to male power. They believe hizab police will get more strong. Hizab is not a statement of respect and solidarity. 
Muslim women are arginine against her performance.  
What did male politicians do to show that support? 

&gt;You are trying too hard, and you are in the wrong. 


No, I am not doing this too hard, and no I am not wrong.   If anything, you are shamelessness degrading that PM. Your desire to shamelessly support that PM demonstrates your lack of understanding .  Your PM gullible western mock Muslim feminists. 

Do you like to know what happened to my friends and acquaintances after her burkha debacle?"
1306,ek8clfd,"Yes it's a turban, but turbans worn by Muslim women are usually called hijabs, so it wouldn't be incorrect to refer to it as a hijab. "
1307,ek9y4md,"&gt; Other women choose to cover up - read, they have become complacent in their oppression and this is even worse.

Would you say the same thing about Christian women who choose to not to wear short dresses or skirts?  Or Orthodox Jewish women who choose to wear wigs.  Or even atheist women who choose to dress modestly?

&gt; If you don’t know who Stephen is in Django, he is a loyal house slave who enjoys serving his owners and is just as racist as them.

This comment reflects are really embarrassing level of unfamiliarity with not only Muslims, but Black people as well.  Congrats.

&gt; Women who choose to cover up go on to force their daughters too until they also choose to cover up.

I personally know multiple families where the mother wears a veil and the daughter does not, and two families where a daughter wears the hijab and their mother does not.

&gt; Everybody knows that Hijab is designed to hide beauty. 

It is designed to protect modesty, just like most items of clothing.

&gt; Dressing women up in black veils was done so their husbands didn’t have to worry about other men looking at them.

It’s also done independently by women who want to hide themselves from the male gaze.  You might know that if you actually took time to listen to the opinions of hijabis, but clearly you don’t care about them or their feelings, you just want to use them as weapon.

&gt; It’s the same as a western woman being told by her boyfriend she can’t show her cleavage but taken to the nth degree.

So would you also argue that any woman who chooses not to show her cleavage is complicit in her own oppression, or is there some reasons why non-Muslim women are allowed to choose to be modest, but Muslim women are not?"
1308,ekbt8mr,"Saying women shouldn't wear the Hijab is just as absurd as saying they should. It's a part of their culture, which is why even in the U.S. and Canada, and other first world countries, many women still opt to wear it; similarly, many women opt to take it off. I believe recognizing that many women choose to wear it just as important as recognizing many women are forced to. Third world patriarchy goes far beyond forcing women to wear a Hijab. I agree on that front, but the framing of this post really pushes the idea that all Muslim women are forced to wear the Hijab, when it is in fact part of their faith of choice."
1309,ekdxmqh,"A Hijab / veil is absolutely compulsory for all Muslim women to wear. The fundamental difference between a Hijab and a Habit is that to become a nun, it's a voluntary thing you 'apply' to become, and devote an incredible amount of time and effort to stay 'pure' for God, or whatever. If someone wants to, it's still entirely possible to stop being a nun, and it's all up to you -- your own decision. All Muslim women are *obligated* to wear a veil in accordance to what the Qur'an says, it's not something they can choose to dismiss."
1310,ekfh8js,"Because the topic of discussion is whether or not Muslim women are physically forced to wear a hijab in the US, which they are not in anyway. I am aware that it was originally formed as a concept to curb male sexual desire but it is quite clearly now a symbol of their religion and culture to most Muslim women and claiming ""argh it symbolizes oppression"" without being considerate of the opinion of the people you think are oppressed is a little ironic. 

Outrage against a woman willingly wearing a piece of cloth on their head and thinking it means US is gonna adopt sharia law and other nonsense is alarmist Islamophobic ridiculousness. Just let the lady wear the God damn headscarf."
1311,ekfhkpg,"&gt;...? No, that is not what I consider culture. The Quran states, 'there is no compulsion in Religion', meaning exactly the opposite of what you're saying here.

... But that is what happened and is happening? 

&gt;Yes, you think so you don't know for sure. I assume you're not Muslim, right? Or an ex Muslim. Or have any contact with Muslims, and if you did, asked the Muslim women about their opinion concerning hijabs. Yet here you are, ""defending"" them? Without even knowing their stance on this, you're imposing what you think they want on them?

I was not talking about what Muslim women think, I was talking about what the people that share my opinion think. We are not telling you what to wear, or that it should be the law. I'm saying I think what people dislike about western women wearing the hijab is that you are telling the millions of women still at risk of torture and death for wearing it to to fuck themselves. That you can still br controlled and oppressed simply by being brainwashed.

&gt;And no, Those women died for the ability to choose for themselves, yet here you are, denying the women who want to wear a hijab that choice.

Died implies they are donr dying. They are not. Millions of muslim women are still at risk of public humiliation, stoning, and death. You honor or respect them by wearing what they have to in a country thay will freely allow you not to?

&gt;Secondly, in Islam we respect Muslims and non-Muslims alike. One of the 5 pillars of Islam is Zakaat, (giving 2.5% of our income for the poor, I can be off on the percentage), and it should be given to the poor regardless of their religion.
&gt;
I'm not gonna start the topic of Islam and it's books meaning. 
A fraction of what size. The Sikh Turban is comparable to the Muslim headscarf as in it's put on their head and covers their hair. So I don't see how it's (much) different

It isn't mean to cover the mens face so that women that can't help themselves won't drag them out back and rape them. I will also say that one evil being overlooked doesn't mean another can't be focused on.

&gt;So, in your eyes women are helpless people? Don't you see how sexist you, yourself, are? Don't you see how your actions and words, you deem righteous, are being shaped by your opinion that women can't speak up for themselves and can't choose for themselves?

Pointing out history and ongoing mass oppression still occuring in many muslim areas doesn't say shit about what I think of women. I think women in America havr the freedom to choose hoe they dress. I simply believe, rather strongly, that ""choosing"" to wear a symbol of hatred and oppression towards women makes you an idiot.

&gt;One, I, as a Muslim, don't see it as stupid, nor hypocritical or ignorant. Why does wearing a piece of cloth on your head make you all these things? The people in the West wearing a hijab in protest are defending the Muslim women who are being targeted by far right lunatics. This a feminist movement defending women, and it just so happens that these women are Muslims who want to wear hijabs. That's what bothers you.

A feminst movement to wear a garb whose single purpose for countless generations, and still now in many countries was to hide and help own women? Yea makes sense until you realize your face is still hidden and those that forced it are still getting exactly what they wanted. It's the equivalent of an employee being told to sweep the floor by a boss, when said employee then jumps on a chair and declares to be sweeping simply because of choice, not because of what the boss demanded. The boss still gets her floor swept."
1312,ekmmzmu,"I cant stand those comments about how it isnt frocing people into anything. It most certainly is because now, a Muslim woman in hijab, will need to find a new job (and we all know we face discrimination when searching for employment), or take off hijab and most Muslim women are not goin to remove hijab it goes directly against our religion. It is shameful and appalling but I am not even surprised this is even a thing. Whats obvious is they just want people to conform and look a certain way in public because they know that it wont deter Muslims from Islam, we are still going to be Muslim, they just want to satisfy bigoted people in public smh."
1313,ekw9j63,"**Hijab by country**

The word hijab refers to both the head-covering traditionally worn by some Muslim women and Islamic styles of dress in general.

The garment has different legal and cultural status in various countries. In the Indonesian Aceh province, Muslim women are required to wear the hijab and all women are required to do so in Iran.France has banned overt religious symbols, including many religious head coverings, in public schools and universities or government buildings. Kosovo (since 2009), Azerbaijan (since 2010), Tunisia (since 1981, partially lifted in 2011) and Turkey (gradually lifted) are the only Muslim-majority countries which have banned the hijab in public schools and universities or government buildings, while Syria banned face veils in universities from July 2010.

1314,ekwk3pm,"I just think the headcovering is to prevent assimilation. Have you ever seen a non-muslim man (of any color, other/lack of religion, ethnicity) date a nijab/hijab/burqa wearing muslim women???? Even in the most liberal cities/universities, you dont see it. Muslims know that if muslim women marry non muslims, there is a chance shell leave islam. They made sure to set up rules that would prevent that. There is a reason why muslim women are killed in honor killings for dating non muslims."
1315,el0cp7f,"&gt; A lot of Muslim women in the US, for example wear a hijab because they want to,

No, they don't.  Muslim women are very tied to their families, and removing the hijab could get you disowned.  We had a couple of girls in a 7th grade where I student taught remove their head coverings in the bathroom because they couldn't at home.  That is oppressive, and if they were Christian, people would scream about cults, oppression, ignorance, etc.  I'm not a Christian, but the double standard is astonishing.,"
1316,el4bfel,"As a Muslim this is more of a case of just the Middle East tbh, in the UK most Muslim women are not looked down upon for wearing a hijab, and are usually treated equally, but of course there are also about 5% of really strict Muslims who do like to control women and treat them like shit. The next generation of Muslims will be totally diverse though that’s pretty clear as there are less and less religiously strict muslims anymore in the UK."
1317,egmpfy8,"This interaction reminds me of one my mom had once. A random lady asked my mom how she felt when my dad forced my mom to wear the hijab. My mom was stunned because.... Wearing the hijab was her choice, she was the first in both sides of the family to wear it. My dad had nothing to do with that. She tried telling the lady, but the lady kept interrupting her, saying she MUST be oppressed!! And my mom would never know she was oppressed, but this lady does!! Oh my poor mom!!

That was literally one of the most oppressing things Westerners do to Muslim women. They demand that all muslim women are oppressed, even as they are doing the oppressing, because they're not LISTENING, and they don't even want to, because it's not about helping the women that supposedly need their help, it's about elevating themselves morally. 

Can you tell me more about how oppressed I am though. 

"
1318,eguetp0,men don't demand that women to wear hijab. lol. it's usually their mothers starting to talk them into it after a certain age. this might not be the case for some girls but that's how it's usually like. stop trying to make it like all muslim women are being oppressed by men. we don't appreciate it. we're just following the rules of a religion we believe in. thanks
1319,egvnuxd,"No, here's why. In Iran and some other Islamic countries, it's compulsory. It is one of many means of Islamic governments use to oppress and control their citizenry. It's like if the fanatics in Handmaid's Tale - blessed be the fruit, by the way - declared that all men must wear beards. Despite the fact that beards were normal beforehand, they're now something the State has adopted as a means of control. This despite no specific rule is Islam that demands a particular form of clothing.  


Where Muslim women are ostensibly free, that is, here in the West and elsewhere, where they are not subjected to any State-enforced legal regime that compels them to wear particular clothes. A free society equates to the free practice of religion, and Muslim women in free societies who choose hijab are not oppressed in doing so because it is a choice, a choice to follow the precepts of Islam - which advises modesty - in a manner common to many Muslim societies, i.e. covering hair, loose clothing, etc. Are there certain situations where women in a free society feel forced into practices they'd rather not adopt? Of course, and sure, in that way in can be seen as repressive, but by and large - and I have known many Muslim women over the years and have discussed this topic many times - a great many Muslim women you'll encounter in your life in the West (presuming that's where you are) willingly and enthusiastically wear hijab, and would not characterize themselves as ""oppressed."" That's simply Western thinking at work, that we can and should determine for non-Western people what their political/cultural/ethical standards should be.  "
1320,eh4na9e,"Of course, but dismissing the hijab entirely even for women who choose to wear it voluntarily is a massive generalization. Many of us Muslim women are vehemently against pressure to wear the hijab. "
1321,ehmk0bl,"It's the taboo factor, muslim women are not permitted to show skin. Her wearing hijab during sex is a fetish for many. Her being Arab led many to think she is muslim so it was 'authentic' muslim porn."
1322,ehq3o3c,"At last, my time has come!

""Having sex with a Muslim"" is half the statement. You have to finish it with ""Muslim _____"" and fill in the blank with ""man or woman.""

In your case (and mine), it's a woman. Which means you're fucked. 

No, really. You're fucked. 

My experience with a Muslima:

She was wonderfully smart, drop dead gorgeous, and horribly shy, owing to the repression from her dad and brother. 

She was an early-20s woman. She didn't wear the hijab, and sometimes wore shorts - not the booty shorts common among Western women, think Bermuda shorts. Every once in a while, her brother would ""stop by"" her apartment (it was a **problem** that she lived on her own), telling her to start wearing the former and stop wearing the latter. She bravely said no.

He beat the shit out of her. Every time.

In steps me, Kafir, Despoiler of Muslim Virginity. My GF was a secret (it always has to be secret for them) freak. We really loved each other. 

But I saw snippets of her conditioning, indicative of her fear of being found out and her unhealthy relationship with sex. E.g.:

- After the first-ever session: ""Are we in a relationship?""
- After I told her it would take time to build into one: ""Why? We had sex, that's what that means""
- Wouldn't hold hands with me around town, ""in case someone saw""
- Told me I had to convert for us to be ""out in the open"", and pay the *mahr* to her family. I said no. She cried, but knew what she was asking was unfair.

Then her brother found out, through a cousin of a cousin. He threatened to cut my kafir balls off. I noped out of there.
_____________________________________________________

So, to summarize:

- Yes, you are headed into a ""complicated"" situation, to put it lightly. It will almost certainly end poorly.
- Does she have a father? A brother? An uncle? Etc.? If so, he is the ""guardian"" of her and her virtue, and he will make you pay for taking it, either by converting and marrying her or trying to kill you. 
- Don't be surprised if she tries to extract commitment, because Muslim women are conditioned to treat sex as currency and she is taking a **huge** risk by sleeping with you. It could get her ostracized from her community, which means social, sometimes real, death. 
- I wish the best for you two. Be honest and loving to each other, because you're in a really hard situation - it's like relationships on Legendary Difficulty in *Halo.* Be as patient as possible, and if you care for each other try to find a way forward. But accept that it might be impossible for you to be together without her entire social identity being destroyed, because that's how the community polices itself. 

Good luck. "
1323,ehshgn4,"Sorry, was typing from my phone and I'm not good at typing long comments on it. I wasn't really sure how to phrase what I meant and realised at the time I'd probably failed. What I mean by 'cultural policing' is how stringent a culture enforces certain ideas by virtue or peer pressure and expectation, rather than some literal mob of police or anything. If something is strongly looked down on or discouraged by the majority of people, that's the sort of thing I'm talking about.

It'll vary place to place and definitely isn't common across all of Islam, but there's certainly a lot of cultural expectation for women to cover their hair at all times when in public. There are also certain countries which are even more extreme, with the niqab or burqa. To say there's no cultural demand by the general populace in those places would be downright silly to me. To completely flout those social conventions is obviously more than a minor faux pas. But even in more moderate countries where it's more acceptable to see some amount of women choose to abstain from covering their hair, those that do choose to abide are likely to be fairly stringent about making sure hair is covered more totally.

But this? Most of the women still had some of their hair visible, it clearly wasn't considered immodest to have their hair seen at all. There's also clearly a lax enough cultural expectation that even in a couple of photos you're already seeing women who didn't decide to cover their heads.

Head coverings are common across all cultures, and widely accepted in Western cultures too. Obviously hats exist. Bonnets, while no longer really worn at all, were considered modest to my understanding. I think everyone in western society is familiar with the older generation of women wearing shawls to cover their hair. But that often wasn't a factor of ""It's immodest to show my hair"" as much as fashion or routine or simply a way to keep their head warm or their hairstyle safe from the elements. A hijab might also, to a degree, achieve those things but the majority of its presence is a result of Islamic views on modesty down to the gender of who you're with.

I didn't think anyone who has heard of a hat could possibly think women covering their heads or hair was solely a product of Muslim nations, so I can't see that video as anything other than an earnest comparison between cultural expectations of modesty and how those are expressed. Which I don't think is quite accurate. The video shows standards that are quite clearly far more lax, and may be driven by entirely different rationale. Without actual historical context for all I know, it was simply the fashion not to have a bare head (even the young boys, likely to be completely free of any expectations of modesty, wore caps) or, even more simply, it was simply cold.

It's certainly an interesting cultural artifact, especially given to how similar some of the items looked to the kind of items Muslim women wear across different cultures and regions, but it felt like that video was trying to say that the culture or social expectations were similar rather than just the fashion itself (after all, absolutely no one I've ever met has any objection to the practice based purely on the grounds of fashion or dress-code).

But yeah, my comment earlier did read like ""Muslim women are FORCED to wear this!!"" or some other Daily Mail drivel, so I apologise for that. I merely meant that there's, often, a stronger social expectation dependant on the community or region they're in, which I hope is a more reasonable phrasing."
1324,ehuhx1c,"Unpopular fact - Muslim women are not all poor terrified little babies under the cosh of their husbands, and despite it making little sense to us, actually wear a hijab out of choice. How patronising to speak for them all!"
1325,ei10bzc,"Well, nuns around the world choose to wear a habit whereas many Muslim women are forced to wear a hijab. "
1326,ei19r8l,"You do realize that modest fashion has been growing in popularity across every non-Muslim communities but was sparked in part by hijab wearing women wanting to be fashionable? 

Modesty is their whole jam when it comes to wearing hijab. That's not some sudden trigger word that was just made up. I think it's a weird billboard but no, lots of liberal and conservative non-Muslim women are all about modest fashion themselves. "
1327,ei1x6ob,"There's a huge difference between the Black community using a racial epithet and wearing a burqua.

1)  The use of the word was first used by Black people sarcastically and explicitly. There was literally no way to misinterpret the way they were using it.

2) It's a word. Language is communication. Symbols are concepts conveyed in a different way. If I hear some people joking around and using the term, I have *context* without interacting with them at all to understand how/why they're using it. If I see a woman wearing a hijab on the street, I have no context. A symbol cannot speak except for what it is known to convey, and that leads us to,

3) AGAIN, the hijab is, today, this very day, this very evening, being used to subjugate, to oppress, and to punish. I guarantee you that if I dig long enough I can find yet another news story about a woman who was caught outside without one being hurt, arrested, or tortured. TODAY.  The word you're referencing, being used by the Black community to empower itself, was only started AFTER the word took on a negative connotation and was rejected by many people. Rejected. As in, not used unless you were an asshole. White people using that word in the 60's and 70's and to this day, were shunned by those uncomfortable with the connotations of it. There was a penalty for using it in the majority of public places and even most private ones. The hijab is still PUBLICLY endorsed and forced upon millions of women worldwide. *Millions*. It's not an outlying concept. It's not like the majority of Muslims worldwide have taken a public stance and stated that it was a horrible practice that shouldn't have taken place. In fact, the majority of Muslims still truly believe that it is and should be used as a form of modesty because a woman *belongs* to her husband and should submit to him. The MAJORITY. 


There is literally no comparison here. The majority of the non-Christian world supports the hijab. Muslims make up 1.5 BILLION people. Over 50 countries report as being Muslim. And of those Muslims it's a very, very, very slim margin that *don't* wear the hijab as a requirement. How many fucking news stories about Muslims in Europe protesting because women can't get ID cards without taking it off? Do I actually have to google this stuff for you? There are fucking LAWS in France and Germany and other countries, that they had to pass, to force people to *show* themselves for an ID. 

The vast majority of Muslims, again, over 1 billion people on this planet, support hijabs and subjugation of women. No amount of women ""just wearing it in honor of my religion but totes don't support that other stuff"" is going to change that viewpoint and in fact only enforce the idea that Muslim women are forced to wear it.



"
1328,ei8956s,"You talk about how there is a reform where Christianity is separated from the state and I agree with that. Most muslim countries do the same. Egypt, Lebanon, and many other countries in the middle east don't have kings and don't rule with the religion and have it separated from the state. moreover, Muslim women are never ever punished by their governments for their decisions. Maybe they are stricter in countries like Saudi Arabia but they aren't thrown in jail if they don't wear the hijab. I feel like when you talk about Muslim countries you have a very narrow viewpoint of what Muslims look like and who they really are.

&amp;#x200B;"
1329,eib4tvj,"i don’t think it would have made any sense until she explained it to the judges, but honestly i don’t really see it being that controversial. i think most people think that wearing a hijab or something is offensive because it kinda ties into the western idea that muslim women are oppressed and forced to wear that. i think some muslim/modest fashion is very beautiful and i wouldn’t consider it to be problematic if someone wore something of that nature on the show but I bet a lot of people would be triggered by it. "
1330,eihfhg7,"I don’t completely disagree with you but you have to understand that “brainwashed since child” argument is very silly. We are all brainwashed into wearing clothes and shamed if walking around naked. It’s just called conforming and it’s not the worst thing in the world. We wear what people around us wear. The hijab isn’t some awful thing that hurts to wear, it is just a scarf.

Second, you start off by saying “[it’s] fucked up that people still defend the hijab”. What do you mean? Do you mean it’s fucked up that people still defend women’s right to wear whatever they want? The hijab itself does not symbolise oppression. Do you know the country with the largest Muslim population? You’d probably guess somewhere in the middle-east right? Well it’s Indonesia, and if you’ve ever been you know women there are not forced to wear hijab. Lots and lots do, but they are not forced to. And you can walk around Jakarta in shorts and a crop top if you want (although culturally it’s inappropriate in the same way walking around a city in just your boxers or swimming trunks is). Stop thinking of the Middle East every time you think of hijabi women, think of south east Asia.

Of course no one should be forced to wear a hijab, and that is a massive problem in some places, but in the western world islamophobia is a bigger problem, forcing women NOT to wear hijab is a bigger problem. Using the hijab as a symbol of oppression stems from a lack of understanding and generalisation, and that stigma hurts muslims everywhere.

Have you ever met a Muslim women? I think that your comment demonstrates that you know none or very few and briefly and base your opinion off how Muslim women are portrayed to you.

I grew up in a south East Asian country with a very large Muslim population and now live in Australia. My brother in law is Muslim, his and my sisters two kids are Muslim, I have many Muslim friends and after moving to Australia I now have Muslim friends from all over the world, not just south east Asia. None of them are forced to wear the hijab in a violent or oppressive way. Some choose to, some choose not to, and some choose to wear it sometimes. Other than my friend from Iran, none of them had any problems walking around their home countries with or without the hijab on, but here in Australia one of my friends got her hijab ripped off her head on public transport, another got followed home and cursed out. Many Muslim women in the western world are scared to wear their hijabs because there are so many people misunderstanding them and hating them for it. 

I’m not trying to have a go at you, just dissecting your comment and trying to show you that there’s nothing wrong with a head scarf just like there’s nothing wrong with a shirt. Problems like the one in this article come from a sickening culture of misogyny, not from muslims or the headscarf.

"
1331,eihqsve,"I'm happy that you've come here to clear you doubts by actually asking REAL Muslims, because we're being seriously misrepresented by the media and ignorant violent people.

There are many other people here who have MUCH more knowledge than I do, so this serves as a way for me to confirm my existing knowledge and also to answer some of your questions.

1) As far as I know, we're taught that Jesus was one of the BEST messengers of Allah and there's a reason he was chosen to be the one who defeats the Anti-Christ ( Dajjal, as we call him) and to unite the Muslims before the Day of Judgement. We, however, are  referred to as Muhammad's nation, so we explicitly follow his way of life and his teachings as given by Allah.

2) They way you suggest here ( the way Christian's pray) is done in Islam too, it's actually called 'Dua'. We pray 5 times a day, (more of a obligatory worship) and then we also make 'dua' to Allah when we want something or we wish for something to happen.

3)  [https://draxe.com/why-you-should-avoid-pork/](https://draxe.com/why-you-should-avoid-pork/) 

I'm pretty sure all Abrahamic faiths warn people not to eat pork, but Muslims seem to be the only ones following it today. This article shows why eating pork is bad for humans. Pigs are scavenger animals that eat literally anything they can find on a farm. They have very little sweat glands, and this leads to toxic build-up in their bodies.

4) Nah. Those people will not be forgiven for those sins unless they ACTUALLY regret them. This is just a blatant misuse of Allah's forgiveness. They're misguided people doing wrong things.

5) Contrary to belief, Muslims are not required to read the Quran in Arabic. They have to pray in Arabic, because it's an act of worship, but they're allowed to READ the Quran in any language of their preference. Most people are encouraged to learn Arabic and read it in Arabic because Arabic is a difficult language to translate and it becomes difficult to translate all meaning into other languages. 

Also, it becomes harder for someone to change things in the Quran if everyone is reading it in its original language. Muslims believe that the Bible and other holy scriptures were originally sent by Allah, but they were corrupted by humans down the line. The starting line of the Quran, Allah makes a promise where he says he will protect the Quran from adulteration till the end of time.

6) Naturally, we Muslims don't believe in denominations and there wasn't supposed to be any factions in the religion from early on. Somewhere down the line, there emerged a controversy and the whole Muslim nation split into two, Sunni and Shia. I don't know much about this, and I'm pretty sure someone else here can clear your and my doubts better.

7) Muslim women are required to wear hijab. Hijab here means 'dressing with modesty'. Muslim women aren't required to wear full head to toe covering all the time ( it's called abaya). They should simply wear clothes that are opaque, loose-fitting, and importantly, don't reveal the shape of their body at all. They're also required to cover their hair. 

Women are considered beautiful and respectful people in Islam; they shouldn't feel the need to show off their beauty to strangers. They should respect their beauty and keep it to them and their household only. This way, it allows for a cleaner society with less mistakes. Scientifically, men are more lustful than women, so having women cover themsleves up and not the other way around makes sense.

Generally Muslims are encouraged not to engage physical contact with the opposite sex if you're not considering them for marriage ( of if they're not immediate relation like father, mother ,sister, brother etc.) because the smallest touch may lead to a big domino effect. This may seem as harsh in western culture, but the Muslim world is more keen on preserving it's morals rather than punishing those who don't. People aren't absolutely barred form handshakes, although it is encourged to avoid them if you can."
1332,eiiue0r,"Thank you :)

&gt;Make hijab and modesty a social norm.

I am not sure about this. The social norm should reflect the society not enforced by the government.

&gt;Make hijabi models mainstream. Mandate hijab for high ranking Muslim-specific leadership roles. 

I agree with you here. 

&gt;Regulate clothing stores to sell clothes compliant with dress codes. Fine stores that sell clothes that do not comply.

I don't think this is realistic. First, Muslim women are mandated to wear hijab/modest clothes in public, but not in private. They are allowed to wear ""immodest"" clothes when being intimate with their husband, in the presence of their family and in the company of other women. In women-only parties or segregated parties like in weddings for example, they can wear pretty much all types of dresses, except clothes that show between the navel and the knee (rules of covering for women in presence of other women). Second, regulating clothes stores won't stop people from bringing them back when returning back from traveling abroad. So, I think the clothing stores should sell pretty much any type of clothes. It's the onus on the woman buying them to choose whether to wear them in public, in private, or in women-only segregated places. 

&gt;Ban going nude in public or exposing the breasts, cleavage / buttocks / upper thighs; make it punishable with a reprimand and a fine staggered to meet the degree of violation. Make these nudity rules apply to everyone.

OK, we agree on nude ban. On what basis do you justify covering the parts you mentioned and not others? (I noticed you left the stomach area, is it on purpose or just an error of omission?) "
1333,eioob1s,"It is more nuanced than that. It isnt exactly gender apartheid. And I am saying this as an atheist Turkish woman, living in NZ. 

Some muslim women are forced and the hijab is a symbol of oppression yes. But some wear it just because they want to. It is equally important to protect the rights of both these segments to do whatever they want. If they want to wear it, they should have a right to wear it. If they dont want to wear it, they should have a right to NOT wear it.

But in Jacinda's case, she is not condoning one or the other. She is just signalling ""your beliefs are welcome here"". 

In a separate issue, NZ is actually very good about helping immigrant women get out of abusive relationships, forced marriages, forced anything.

The problem is not the hijab. The problem is forcing people to live one way or the other."
1334,eip5mni,Just so that I understand your views a little better. Are you saying the hijab itself is oppressive and shouldn’t be worn by anyone or that a group of Muslim women are forced to wear it against their will? 
1335,eirrpu7,"You're kidding yourself if you think Muslim women are genuinely free to choose not to wear hijab or niqab today. The social cost, the harassment, the family harassment all make it not possible. Search for photos of Egyptian women or Afghan women before the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudis started spreading their poisonous ideology around the world and then compare them to today. "
1336,eel1lvj,"I’m actually doing this for a Women in Islam paper, and it started off as a joke, but... our prompt is to write about influential women in islam and I was like “haha i’m gonna write about Mia Khalifa” (porn star) but then I got to thinking....

Mia Khalifa wore a hijab in one of her porns and was banned from Lebanon (home country) and hitmen were sent for her. Like that was just crazy to me. So then I started thinking... I want to learn more about what other Muslim women are doing to challenge sexuality norms in the Muslim community!

There’s actually a hashtag called #mosquemetoo where girls are coming out about going to Mecca for haaj and are being groped! It’s the holiest place for Islam and women are being groped and harassed while trying to praise Allah. 

I also found a book called Mona Eltahawy “Headscarves and Hymens: Why the Middle East Needs a Sexual Revolution”

I haven’t done much research yet but I think it would be super cool to look into!!"
1337,eemxon9,"&gt;Let's be honest, the meaning behind the hijab (or the burka) is that it's to show how 'pure' the wearer is and how much of a whore any uncovered woman is.

Irrelevant to the contrast in attitudes towards both of these garbs. 

First, the burka is common in countries much more comparitively notorious for female oppression including Afghanistan or KSA.      
Secondly, few donners of burqa defend it compared to hijab, possibly because they aren't that literate in Western nations, but the more illiterate the more probability of abuse.

And the hijab doesn't defend sexual purity, it is enforced due to Umar's perversion. These garbs being a defense from sexual approaches is a modern apologetic, and if anything is sexual it constitutes the fact that it's a cover-up of male property from other men. Because Umar had to literally harass M's wife for him to comply.

And I still don't believe there is a structural pressure to wear the hijab beyond a few anecdotes which can attributed to alarm to growing irreligiousity in said victim. Which is why Western Muslims may feel pressurized to wear it.     
Muslim women are deluded and it's preferrable to grant them autonomy when criticising their beliefs. Wo"

Now I haven't followed it, but I was under the impression the hijab ban did get stayed by the court. Mind you, Quebec has overwhelming support for this. It's going to happen.”

Disinformation as always.

First of all, the hijab is not mandated in the Qu’ran, it’s a cultural garment. Muslim women are under no obligation to wear it. Banning a cultural garment doesn’t constitute a Muslim ban, your just being extreme with that. 

Second, they didn’t ban the hijab, they banned government employees from wearing any kind of religious garments in government buildings and institutions. That includes all religions, isn’t exclusive to muslims and cannot be enforced in the private sector. 

Also, your theory on the country breaking apart is ridiculously. "
1343,efd96hm,"&gt;Disinformation as always.

Disinformation? I provided a link from a few months ago. Quebec is going forward with the hijab ban. 

&gt;First of all, the hijab is not mandated in the Qu’ran, it’s a cultural garment. Muslim women are under no obligation to wear it. Banning a cultural garment doesn’t constitute a Muslim ban, your just being extreme with that.

Whether or not their religion tells them to wear it is irrelevant. They are wearing it because of their religion. I explained how it is a muslim ban. You can discuss my points I made if you like. 

&gt;Second, they didn’t ban the hijab, they banned government employees from wearing any kind of religious garments in government buildings and institutions. That includes all religions, isn’t exclusive to muslims and cannot be enforced in the private sector.

Still not seeing any 'disinformation' here. You're arguing about minor details. The CAQ are on the record saying the Liberals werent going far enough. And the liberals were banning more than just employees. Anyone who used any service, which means a muslim woman wearing a hijab could basically go nowhere and do nothing. 

Ironically, Trudeau is on the right side here. Trudeau opposes Quebec's hijab ban. Good on him for that. 

&gt;Also, your theory on the country breaking apart is ridiculously.

Have you seen the separatism polls in Alberta, Saskatch, and Ontario being over 40% each? 

I suspect the separatism will die out until October. No point using a big hammer like forming a new country without Quebec when you could just win the election and fix the issues like this racism from Quebec. "
1344,efm5ty9,"Source on ""many cases that Muslim women are not wearing hijab on their own wish"""
1345,efnhxxj,"I am an ex-muslim, and I absolutely despise the hijab. I think that it is an oppressive tool used to control women. I was forced to wear hijab and even later on the niqab. So I understand fully how oppressive hijab can be.

At the same time, my experience doesn't dictate other's experience when it comes to hijab. Some Muslim felt it liberating putting on hijab. Some Muslim were actually given a choice to wear it.

I think these women campaigning against hijab need to recognize that. But, at the same time hijabi women also need to acknowledge, that yes there are Muslim women are forced to wear hijab. It isn't a choice for everyone.

The Manon focus when it comes to hijab should be choice.


"
1346,efxrqun,"Yeah im gonna have to say this completely uncorroborated fact is entirely pulled out of your ass to support a position you already have. 

I've personally only ever known 1 American Muslim girl whose parents pressured here to wear the hijab out of tons of Muslims and Muslim families I've known. 

I've heard a lot more stories about religious harassment of girls in headscarves and even just racial harassment of middle eastern looking people in comparison. 

Maybe we need to listen to what Muslim women are saying about this and not white Christian Quebecois women. "

1348,eg5ye4r,"&gt;They lump faceveils and headscarves together. Next time, please cite credible studies that actually try to distinguish the two. Otherwise, you come off as someone who is arguing in poor faith. 

Yeah, I didn't put much work into this comment because I thought it was known that niqabs were banned (as you said) and hijabs are being banned from public schools (excluding most, if not all, colleges and universities), discriminated against in many workplaces and banned from public workplaces (government institutions and/or civil servants).

&gt;Who is? Which countries or companies have banned the hijab? Not the niqab, the hijab.   
&gt;  
&gt; All you have is anecdotal evidence if even. Maybe those hijabi women didn't get hired because they are simply unqualified. How do you know the hijab played a role in them not being hired? Were they told specifically you aren't being hired because you wear a hijab? 

[France bans veil in public schools](https://www.facinghistory.org/civic-dilemmas/france-bans-veil-public-schools)

This is also the case in other European countries.

[Employers can ban staff from wearing headscarves EU court rules](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/mar/14/employers-can-ban-staff-from-wearing-headscarves-european-court-rules)

&gt;The more plausible explanation is that these women, if they even properly applied, were passed over for some reason and then cried the hijab card. But we can never know because we don't have any systematic data on this, aside from your anecdotal evidence. 

Oh so when the employers asks them if it's possible for them to work without wearing a hijab which they decline to and afterwards don't get the job, they're just crying the ""hijab card"". But yeah, as you said, these are just anecdotes. Discrimination on the job market is difficult to document since there are very few studies on it and many people calling these discrimination just ""crying the race/religious card"", indirectly allowing these practices to continue. 

&gt;Yet, there is no country in Europe or anywhere for that matter that banned the hijab. There isn't a secular religious police that goes around beating women for wearing hijabs. So there is a difference. Unfortunately, you are not acknowledging it and just trying to excuse it. 

And in Muslim countries there is? As said, there's only a few Muslim countries (a fraction) that actually are forcing women to wear a hijab. By the way, with ""the West"" are you also including Eastern Europe? Because if so, this statement of yours can be debunked real quick. 

And where am I excusing this? I'm all for freedom of choice and against restrictions, it's sickening to see countries put in restrictions and bans on religious actions and clothing. But it seems like you know me better than I do.

&gt;On top of that, I already addressed how Muslim communities enforce the hijab through pressures. Your workplace won't beat you up or disown you for wearing a hijab, like many Muslim families will. These are all substantive differences. So I am sorry, your argument doesn't pass muster. 

In the same way I addressed how companies in the West discriminate against hijabis, how communities in the west harass woman and girls wearing hijabs ([Harassment in London](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11848780/Islamophobic-Britain-Muslim-women-are-spat-on-and-covered-in-faeces.html)), how in villages and cities vandalize mosques, [The Hague Mosque vandalized](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/hague-mosque-vandalized-180204084306933.html) (and even deny the adhan, [hungarian mayor bans Islamic call prayer](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4199610/Hungarian-mayor-bans-Islamic-call-prayer-face-veils.html)). Seems like your anecdotes are worth being seen as arguments, but mine are not.

I guess you don't know the difficulties of being a Muslim in the West, so I won't blame you for your ignorance. Sorry for the late answer."
1349,eg62fjs,"That's not true either, they are some households of course where every female is a hijabi or niqabi and there's strong pressure to adhere to such codes. There's only two places where the hijab is enforced: Iran and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. It was enforced in Saudi Arabia until recently when MbS stripped the religious police of their authority to do this. In practice, across the Muslim world families are a mix of hijabis and non-hijabis and there's cyclical waves of the hijab being more prominent (we're currently in one) and it being less popular. In a lot of Western countries, the hijab is more common among younger females than it is among older Muslim women, most older Muslim women in the UK for example don't wear it whereas younger ones do. 

The cultural thing doesn't run either, in every single Muslim country, the women in the media don't wear hijab, almost every billboard you'll see advertising something will have a non-hijabi female on it, the most famous Muslim women are non-hijabis, the exception is YouTubers where there's actual hijabi personalities. No doubt some individuals may feel an atmosphere of fear stemming from their families who follow Islam in a certain way but I regularly hear white people pretending to know what the atmosphere is like in these countries without knowing a single thing about what it's actually like living there."

Hijab is a must for women in Islam, however it is their choice if they want to follow it. No human can force or punish them but god can and it is considered a sin. Most Muslim women are pressured (not so much forced in the west) to wear it by parents and society. They wont be beaten for not wearing it, although some might be disowned or financially cut off, but most will suffer damaged relationships with their parents/family members. "

Her husband or father can ask or demand that she cover her face and she can choose to accept or not. It's that simple. It sounds to me that you think muslim women are meek. It's clear to me that you have based your opinions on muslim stereotypes.

Now, if she is forced to wear it against her will then it defeats the purpose of wearing it. This is because she is not wearing it out of piety but fear.  She might as well not wear it! These garments predate Islam and will not go away because people think they are oppressive.

I can tell you have ethnocentric views and will not accept anything I say. Have you even been to a muslim majority country? Have you spoken to a woman who covers her face? You are half a world away and you make assumptions based on what? CNN? BBC?

Muslim women are OBLIGATED to wear the hijab. Saying they ""choose"" it is just retroactive rationalization. How is it a choice if you HAVE to do it? The hijab cannot be divorced from its context .

There's a huge difference between saying ""I believe women should wear what they want"" and ""The hijab is a symbol of feminism"". What next, are burqas symbols of liberation now? 

Fuck no, it's a symbol of submission to MEN. Women wear it because they think their hair is seductive and will tempt men into raping/molesting them. Veils of all kinds place the burden on women to control the behaviour of men. It's no different to telling women to wear ankle length skirts to protect them from rape. Of course, women should be free to wear ankle length skirts if they so choose, but that reasoning is just fucking stupid.

Do you know how the hijab became mandatory in Islam? Umar, one of Mohammed's friends, spied on Mohammed's wife Sauda at night when she went to the field to shit/piss. She was obviously embarrassed and Mohammed later received a revelation from Allah saying that now all Muslim women have to wear veils. LOL!

&amp;#x200B;

**Narrated 'Aisha: The wives of the Prophet used to go to Al-Manasi, a vast open place (near Baqia at Medina) to answer the call of nature at night. 'Umar used to say to the Prophet ""Let your wives be veiled,"" but Allah's Apostle did not do so. One night Sauda bint Zam'a the wife of the Prophet went out at 'Isha' time and she was a tall lady. 'Umar addressed her and said, ""I have recognized you, O Sauda."" He said so, as he desired eagerly that the verses of Al-Hijab (the observing of veils by the Muslim women) may be revealed. So Allah revealed the verses of ""Al-Hijab"" (A complete body cover excluding the eyes). Sahih Bukhari 1:4:148**

حَدَّثَنَا يَحْيَى بْنُ بُكَيْرٍ، قَالَ حَدَّثَنَا اللَّيْثُ، قَالَ حَدَّثَنِي عُقَيْلٌ، عَنِ ابْنِ شِهَابٍ، عَنْ عُرْوَةَ، عَنْ عَائِشَةَ، أَنَّ أَزْوَاجَ النَّبِيِّ، صلى الله عليه وسلم كُنَّ يَخْرُجْنَ بِاللَّيْلِ إِذَا تَبَرَّزْنَ إِلَى الْمَنَاصِعِ ـ وَهُوَ صَعِيدٌ أَفْيَحُ ـ فَكَانَ عُمَرُ يَقُولُ لِلنَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم احْجُبْ نِسَاءَكَ‏.‏ فَلَمْ يَكُنْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَفْعَلُ، فَخَرَجَتْ سَوْدَةُ بِنْتُ زَمْعَةَ زَوْجُ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم لَيْلَةً مِنَ اللَّيَالِي عِشَاءً، وَكَانَتِ امْرَأَةً طَوِيلَةً، فَنَادَاهَا عُمَرُ أَلاَ قَدْ عَرَفْنَاكِ يَا سَوْدَةُ‏.‏ حِرْصًا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْزِلَ الْحِجَابُ، فَأَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ آيَةَ الْحِجَابِ‏.‏

The first Arab feminists viewed the hijab as a symbol of male oppression and took it off. The Muslim world has simply gone backwards.

&amp;#x200B;

**Consequences of taking off hijab:**

Prison (Iran/Saudi Arabia)

[Social rejection by other Muslims. Muslims are extremely hateful towards women who take it off. Dina Tokio received thousands of hateful comments calling her a slut/whore riding the cock carousel and that she should die etc. after she announced she was going to take it off.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3kIJd-_yiY&amp;t=699s) If that is how women get treated for doing something as innocent as showing their hair in public, then no wonder most Muslim women wear it!

Acid attacks. Imagine having your life ruined because you refused to wear a piece of cloth on your head.

Being called a slut/whore. A woman showing her hair in public is considered to be ""naked"" in Islam.

Death/Violence from family

Most Muslims believe they will go to hell if they don't wear hijab

I'm not angry at Muslim women for wearing hijab. I recognize that they are simply trying to live their lives as peacefully as possible and the hijab gives them social respectability, acceptance from their communities and a limited measure of safety. If I grew up in a conservative Muslim country, then I would most likely wear the hijab too to protect myself from being thrown in jail, harassed in public, disowned by my family, killed, beaten, having acid thrown on my face and being completely rejected by Muslims and not being able to find a job/place to rent.

&amp;#x200B;

And before you compare Muslim veils to Christian nun habits, NOPE. Apples and oranges.

Christian women aren't obligated to become nuns. Being a nun is a job and jobs are a matter of choice. Nun dress codes are far more liberal now too. ALL Muslim women have to cover every part of their aside from their hands, face and feet."

1365,edk11rw,"I was just joking on how some people on the Internet think Muslim women are oppressed because they are ""forced"" to wear the hijab or niqab among few other stuff."
1366,edlss9z,"I'm sorry you are forced to wear it (as many women are), all I was saying is that if Muslim women are freed from all other oppression the hijab will either be abandoned, or worn by their own choice. The issue is the culture and people around the habit of wearing a piece of cloth over the hair. You mention its religious significance, I know of that (isn't much of that talk from the hadiths, not from the Quran? Not that the Quran doesn't have loads of other examples of misogyny like any religious text) but some people don't wear hijab for religious reasons. I am not a libfem I am a radfem, I just don't believe an object (ie a headscarf) is the problem. I believe the culture and abuse of women to be the problem (which includes forcing them to wear certain clothing). I've seen violence committed in my country by non Muslims towards women wearing hijab, by demonizing it rather than the root causes of injustice and oppression, I think it creates further prejudice. A woman like yourself who is forced to wear hijab I think is less likely to move in circles that could free her from that oppression, if she is discriminated on sight by non muslims for wearing hijab. I am concerned that those kinds of women may retreat into those cultures even further, when they feel unwelcome and unsafe on the street. I have always wanted to set up some sort of safe place for women who deal with the forced wearing of hijab, I'd like to hear what you think about that, is it even possible? PM me if you like"
1367,ee1vk04,"&gt;In my Muslim family my mother wears precisely it for that reason, in her own opinion. So does my sister. Neither of them was forced into it.

Good for your family, if you are indeed telling the truth. 

&gt;So your preconceived ignorant notion about how if a Muslim woman wears a hijab, then she must be forced into it, is just that: ignorant.

The problem is, millions of Muslim women are coerced or forced to wear the hijab the world over. You can't honestly expect women to have freedom of choice in many Muslim countries, where the state mandates hijab ala Iran and Saudi. On top of that, you ignore familial pressure to don the hijab, undermining the idea that it is a free choice. If the option is getting disowned or beaten in the family, and taking off the hijab then you don't have free choice. And this is the case for many Muslim women the world over. Even in Canada. 

&gt;Each of us has made our own CHOICE. I don't deny the unethical tragedies in which some Muslim families bully their women into wearing a hijab, and such enforcement of religious views onto another person should be dealt with legally whenever applicable... but to use that as a blanket statement on all women with a hijab is extremely ill informed.

How do you propose we go about legislating against familial abuse surrounding the hijab?

1368,ea8djqu,There's always a top post on r/pics and r/OldSchoolCool on Iranian women every month. Most of them don't know that Muslim women are only recommended to wear the hijab while outside of ones home
1369,eacilnf,"Being an ex-muslim I 100% agree with this. I'm freaking 30 years and still told what to wear.

Islam is the most oppressive religion for women. Men have all the power and Muslim women are told that they always have to listen to a male. That they need a mahram (male guardian) to handle all of her affairs.

When I was Muslim I naively believed that Islam treated women with honor and it was the most feminist religion. I now look back at and cringe at how blind I was.

And btw the way, hijab isn't a choice for most Muslim women. There are few women who actually choose to wear it on their own. This is mostly converts that choose. 

But I would say 80% of born Muslim women are pressured or just forced to wear it."
1370,ean6q0u,"For Muslim women especially the ones living in the western Hemisphere, dressing modestly while still keeping it stylish can be a challenge due to the lack of hijab related fashion brands available in the market earlier. However, there are certainly some women fashion houses making a difference in this industry and they are not only aiming at designing beautiful and eye-catching clothes that can be worn by Muslim women, they are also supporting and empowering women all over the world. These are the likes of, [Bokitta](https://www.bokitta.com/) a contemporary hijab and clothing brand for modern and practical Muslim women who believe in the real sense of sisterhood. As a result they have always designed trendy hijab-friendly clothing that many Muslim women are proud to wear and as such they have become a source of inspiration. Recently, high fashion labels such as Nike and Dolce &amp; Gabbana have joined the booming trend of introducing hijabs to the world of fashion. It is such a welcomed gesture and it is certainly needed if Islamic fashion is going to make it big time in the land of glitz and glamour. It is also ironic that the fashion industry has only recently cottoned on about how important it is to start designing and creating edgy clothes for Muslim women. Well, according to the 2015-2016 State of the Global Islamic Economy Report, Muslim consumers spend $230 billion on clothing. 

People are going to stare at you regardless so why don't you give them something to stare at? 

 "
1371,eapbb0l,"True. 

What non-Muslims often do not realise that while they think that Muslim women are oppressed for wearing the hijab (the scarf), the Muslim women think that the non-Muslim women are oppressed for being forced to wear clothes that reveal their bodies in order to be accepted their peers and seen as attractive by their men. Thus, while non-Muslims think that the hijab is worn because men cannot control their desires, Muslims think that having to kowtow to those very desires to acceptable and deemed attractive is far far worse. It is even worse when some feminist movement try to use nudity as a shock tactic to make their point of being empowered yet their escapades are photographed and recorded then displayed in as a source of titillation and pornographic entertainment. "
1372,eazzxc5,"I'm not a woman and i don't wear a niqab, hijab or other similar headwears. However, muslim women are allowed to take it off when they are in the company of only women. In most muslim countries this isn't a problem since there are plenty of women-only salons. Muslim women in western countries usually have their friends do it or simply explain the situation to their hairdresser who will then try to find a more private location."
1373,ebo0nnd,"Indonesia is the largest Muslim majority country, with over 200 million Muslims. But it is NOT law in Indonesia, Muslim women are free to choose to wear the hijab or not. "
1374,ebq5dx0,"&gt;The exact same reason, I imagine (modesty?) but nuns are restricting their attire to profession only. 

This has not always been the case, however.

&gt;but nuns are a small percentage of the population as opposed to every Muslim female on the planet. 

Outside of nations controlled by extreme islamic sects muslim women are not forced by law; the vast majority of adult women in the faith choose to wear it willingly.

There are conservative muslims who would look down on and use familial pressure to enforce wearing a hijab, niqab, or burqa, but this is just as true of amish or mormon christians. Yet we look on them as wacky jesus hobos and underwear cults to chuckle along with.

1378,ebyw3rr,"&gt;And while I realise you are a Quranist, and it is possible that your extended family may be as well, please realise that the vast majority of Muslims do not follow the ""Quranist"" sect.

To be honest my whole family is Sunni. My mother leans more to Shia, and I'm more to Quranism.

&gt;It is never her own choice; if you are wearing something to avoid being punished, it is a ""choice"" made via blackmail. Furthermore, even *if* her family would be accepting of her if she took it off, she also has to worry about the general community. 

Then nothing in a religion is a 'choice'. People go to Church/Mosque/Synagogues because God, women wear hijabs/Tichels because of God, ... 

You say you live in the West, then how would the general community, which is usually mixed, even care about it? Yes some may be condescending but to use this, usually, minority group within a community as a reason to keep wearing a hijab seems a bit far fetched. I comparing this with the Benelux, I'm not sure how the communities outside of here in France and Germany are but I don't think they differ that much.

&gt;They have decided to include hijab in that list. That is not the same as ""refusing to hire someone because they are wearing hijab"". 

*""Although they apply to all beliefs, the ECJ said it was “not inconceivable” that such rules could be deemed indirect discrimination for  targeting Islam over other religions and referred the issue back to the Belgian Court of Cassation.""*

It is not in Christian belief necessary for a person to be wearing a crucifix in order to practice their religion, but it is for (some) Muslim women to wear a hijab, for some Sikhs to wear a turban, for some Jews to wear Kippas, ... This ban is indirectly discriminating against them.

*""The Luxembourg-based court found that a headscarf ban may also constitute “indirect discrimination” if people adhering to a particular religion or belief, such as Muslims, are put at a particular disadvantage.""*

It is easy to put away a necklace with a crucifix or put it under your clothes, still wearing it and not breaking the ban. Bans like these sounds reasonably on paper, but leads to totally different situations in practice.

&gt;The burka ban is simply an extension of the face cover ban and is the same for everyone, non Muslim or not.   
&gt;  
&gt;I am not informed on the burqini band and I will have to do more research on that, but the ban I was referring to is more along the lines of [this](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/31/615758652/denmark-bans-the-burqa-and-niqab). 

Oh, and then referring to what you previous said; do you really believe this ban wasn't purposely issued because of Muslims? Do you really think the people behind this ban were thinking of the whole population and not of Muslims specifically? I don't think you believe this. 

I'm against niqabs and burkas, it's more of a traditional/cultural aspect that seeped into Islam slowly over time because Saudi Arabia is the country that's on the fore front with exporting their variant of Islam (wahabism) to the world. But this ban is still a restriction on ones freedom in my opinion. If we all started banning things because we don't feel comfortable with it, where does it end? Some people don't feel comfortable with people who tattoos, are we going to ban it too? Others don't feel comfortable with some youths walking around with their hood on, are we banning this too? Yes you can say those women were forced into it, but that's speculations. There was a woman in the Netherlands going to a controversial (and quite known too) talk show to defend her right to wear a niqab/burqa, if she can't wear what she want, which isn't offense to any race (like wearing a nazi symbol is to Jews). 

&gt;Sorry, my phrasing was ... being a ""half-ass Muslim"" with the retort that due to hostility towards hijab, you feel safer not wearing it. But if that were to disappear, it would be easier to put the hijab back on than try battling ideas that you don't want to follow Islam. 

Once again, in the Benelux, France and Germany there are many, many Muslim, women not wearing a hijab, what hostility are they facing? And if the hostility (or being called a half Muslim) from the community is this prominent, as you make it look like, then how come so many Muslim women are not wearing one? 

&gt;which, if you don't mind, I would like an idea of what you mean by restricted 

Harassment for wearing a hijab on the streets, discrimination when going to public places (f.e. not being served, being rudely treated, ...), difficulty finding a job, hijabs being banned on schools (high school, not universities), ... these kind of restrictions. 

I'm not a female and still I have my share of discrimination, for hijabis it's much worse unfortunately. It's not that prominent (it doesn't happen every week), but it exists.

&gt;Though, if you don't mind my asking, what sect of Islam does your family follow? 

They're Sunni.

&gt;In others you'll be harassed or assaulted for removing it, and despite not being encoded in law, there is nothing against punishment for removing it. 

This is mostly speculation, or is it not?

&gt;This is not true. ""hijab being forced"" is not a meme reserved for Islamic countries. It holds just as true in the West, which is where I live. 

I also live in the West and I really, really don't see this happening except in the really extreme cases. It isn't even easy to force a woman to wear a hijab in the West, if the worst that can happen is the woman being kicked out of her family or community (which is even less likely) then there're numerous instances that'll help her and numerous legal actions she can take and will protect her. It being not easy doesn't it isn't possible but just unlikely.

&gt;How realistic do you think that law would be? Do you honestly think that's a provable offense or that any of them will be like ""yes i'm very oppressed please arrest my father there's totally no repercussions for that"" 

You are right, it isn't realistic but a national ban on a piece of clothing that's necessary for person to practice their religion also isn't fair. Especially if it's directed towards women, they already have to deal with sexism why make it more difficult for them? 

&gt;Let's say someone did get independent then accused family of doing it. It's just her word against theirs. 

We still live in the West so her word against theirs is more than enough for legal actions to be taken.

&gt;The downvoting people because they disagree could have given you a bad impression of the community, I agree. If you find my comments to be distasteful, let me know. 

I don't find them distasteful, they're respectful in my opinion. As long as one doesn't unnecessarily insult people (whether it be Muslims or not), I have no issue with him/her. "

1385,e8w9q2o,"I'm a feminist and I don't consider Islam to be incompatible with feminism.  I have heard of (White, western) feminists claiming, in a general and ill-informed way, that Muslim women are oppressed because of things that are percieved as oppressive fixtures of Islam in the West, such as burqa and hijab.  However, my sense is that these claims are usually discredited as signifiers of white supremacy, of colonizing muslim women with Western feminist ideals, and of denying agency to Muslim women.  You might want to read works by Chandra Talpade Mohanty or Sherene Razack.  "
1386,e910ul9,"Muhammad was not a feminist, not from his ""historical POV"" either. That's blatant anachronism, because the values of equity and women empowerment imbued in feminist simply didn't exist that time

Muslim WOMEN are true feminists. MUSLIMS (any of them) are not.

Hijab might have been a symbol of resistance in some communist countries, but unless you're living at their successors, it's not a symbol of resistance/empowerment. It's just a religious scarf.

And I must say I'm interested in bbcs article, but the fact they need to discuss whether or not there should be crimes against blasphemy is quite absurd. Really tells how society they're aimed towards, or that they are talking about, has absolutely no respect or notion of religious freedom of speech and whatsoever.

Other than that, I'm quite happy to see American Muslims more progressive than American cons. Maybe next generation, Europe born Muslims are prone of being more progressive? "
1387,e9123fu,"I don't ignore similar behaviors in Christianity and Judaism, where are you getting this from??? I think religion in general is brainwashing because it teaches kids to blindly believe something before they are old enough to question it. In the case of the hijab, Muslim women are taught at a young age that they should wear it to cover their appearance in the presence of any male outside the immediate family as not to incite harassment, and to show modesty. So, cover yourself up from head to toe so you don't tempt men. Very ""feminist"" religion you got there. Some more """"""feminist"""""" things about the Quran: “When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are. If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.” – Surah 21: 7-8

As for what the Koran says about the hijab, the scriptures write that women should wear the veil to stop the unwanted looks and comments from men. I saw this on a YouTube video about the hijab.

1391,e999p9c,You clearly do not understand the history of the hijab and other religious garments to cover the woman's body. The Muslim religious believes that an uncovered woman is tempting men into raping her and if she doesnt cover up it isnt the man's fault but the woman's for being slutty. The hijab is all about control and muslim women are so brainwashed or afraid to not wear one. This is why we should never celebrate it. And islam is not a race. And all religions are patriarchal bullshit.

Also no, tattoos aren’t a health risk to anyone else and very rarely will it actually become a problem to someone who’s getting tattooed. "
1393,e9a5em6,"Here's the thing: Most people don't view the headscarf as a symbol of specific Arabic countries. They view it as a symbol of being Muslim. And when Muslim women outside of those countries, who don't feel pressured to wear headscarves, and won't be punished for not wearing them, decide to do so, they aren't doing so to affirm support for those countries.

However, those women *will* feel pressure against them for being Muslim, hearing people say things like ""Islamic ideas are very misogynistic in every aspect"" or worse. So wearing the Hijab can be as much a symbol of defiance against anti-Muslim and bigoted sentiment as it is a religious practice.

In this situation, Muslim women are pressured to dress a certain way far more by people like you and others who want to police them and tell them what their religion means and what they think than they are by countries they do not reside in and may not have any connection to."
1394,e9afhit,"Adding on to this, although slightly off-topic, Hijab essentially means a veil, or a covering. The women that do hijab mostly do it out of faith, and most Muslims do not see it as oppressive considering the fact that Allah ( i.e. God) has also taken a hijab (this is not to be taken word for word, I'd be glad to properly explain it just pm me). 

Though it is highly desirable and expected of a Muslim woman to wear the hijab, no one can, through physical, mental or psychological force can compel her to wear it. As far as the concept of hijab or 'Pardah' goes, even males have to cover themselves except that the boundings of their covering is less. 

A nun too covers herself the same way a woman wearing hijab does, the only difference being that ( I may be wrong over here) a nun practices a form of  monasticism, while all muslim women are expected to do hijab."
1395,e9g7ixl,"One of the main reasons of the hijab is to preserve the beauty for the husband and avoid being “checked out” by every man walking by, so its kind of contradicting for the woman to hide the beauty of her hair but then put makeup on to make her face more beautiful. So yes the Muslim women are encouraged to not put any of their beauty out for the world to see and that includes make up. "
1396,e9mbdpo,"&gt; Really? You compare muslim women dressing modestly to having pants at your knees? 

no, im not comparing anyone to anyone else, im saying many muslim women dress in medieval ways that signify their lack of freedom

&gt; If muslim women are dressing like that voluntarily, I have no problem with how they're dressing. 

i have much less of a problem with women freely electing to dress like that than i do with women being forced to dress like that, but that doesnt change the fact that hundreds of millions of women are being forced to dress in hijab or niqab or burka for doctrinal islamic reasons. i still think theyre putting on the insignia of an ideology that holds them to be inferior and deserving of much less freedom than men, because that is what theyre doing, but like anyone humiliating themselves without harming anyone else, i think they should be free to do so"
1397,e7zs139,"The area has the highest Islamic population in Cardiff, the women who were raped were all white, non-Muslims who did not wear a veil or any coverings more than anyone else would on a night out, to say this isn't to do with Islam is bordering on silly.

Now let me be clear, because I know this will be misconstrued as be being against all Muslims or something... This is NOT because they are black, nor is it because all Muslims are automatically like this, that is not the case. However, when young Islamic men are told that women should be covered up (be it Niqab, hijab or other similar coverings), that women are lesser than men, that non-Muslims are inferior, there is a clear correlation between rigid Islam and these instances.

Let me give the flip side of that to be fair, I know Muslims through where I went to school, who were absolutely great, but the difference is they did not live in these areas which are hyper-inclusive and don't tend to meet with non-muslims, they also saw Islam as more of a cultural thing and followed it as loosely as most Anglicans do, while speaking to people in these areas take it far more rigidly and literally (like how the Catholics and puritans used to be)

Muslim women do exist is professional roles.  Maybe it’s a localized thing though? I live in Montreal and I see Muslim women in every facet of role but especially in childcare, healthcare and education.  All public roles.  My sons educatrice wears hijab.  She even wears a burkini to the pool on trips to the pool with the kids.  The kids don’t care. My son has never once even asked me about it let alone ask to start attending Mosque. 


Also to add: Quebec is in an extreme crisis in regards to nursing shortages.  We have the largest nursing shortage in the country.  There are definitively more than one hijab sporting nurses in Quebec but even if there was only one, losing her would be a huge loss.

I think some Muslim women are concerned about being modest at the gym. But honestly, ppl don't *care*. Like, at all. Everyone is doing their own thing, most likely with music in their ears, so they're focused on just themselves. Wear loose-fitting workout clothes, a one-piece hijab, and you're good. Granted, I'm sure this is more difficult for larger women. Being modest as a whole is more difficult for larger women. And you don't wanna wear super loose clothes at the gym for safety reasons.

Many Muslim women are scared to wear their hijab because they live in the south and have seen/experienced/heard of hijabis being assaulted for just being out in public.

If you are alone at home (and there is no one who could look at you), you can take off your hijab.
If you are alone with your husband (and there is no one else who could look at you), you can take your hijab off. Husbands and wives can see each other’s body completely. No restrictions.

1409,e7xlq9u,"**TLDR; It's complicated.**

It's heavily debated and there are loads of influences from politics, pre-existing cultures and interpretation of religious books. 

One interesting topic is how the modern **hijab, niqab and burqa** became so prevalent. It's particularly related to politics in the middle east following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire along with the influence of Saudi Arabian interpretation of the Qur'an commonly known as **Wahhabism/Salafism**. 

Link to r/askhistorians on this topic:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4xnkl8/did_majority_of_women_in_medieval_islam_not_wear/] 


As others mentioned, modesty in action, dress and speech is highly praised in Islam. However, the specificity of how a man and woman are to dress comes from secondary sources in **Hadith** (records of companions near Muhammad^pbuh ). The authenticity of Hadith are the mostly highly debated topic in modern Islam and are also the driving force of Sunni/Shi'a divide. 

One particular verse from the Qur'an is often interpreted as meaning Muslim women are required to cover their head, 24:31 (Qur'an). 
You will find many, many different interpretations of that verse and there are still debates as to what the word **khimar** represents. 



You might be able to say a woman is required to wear a head covering using only the Qur'an (debated) but in my opinion it is not up for debate whether a woman is required to wear niqab (face covering) and burqa (loose shapeless garment) inside the Qur'an only. The latter come solely from Hadith. 


This is only the tip of the iceberg and I may have confused you more than you were earlier. 



"
1410,e7xo7qt,"Exactly! but the seer hypocrisy in this post is too much. First of all men and women both has to wear modest clothes and secondly men in Islam are not even allowed to look at the women.( because non-muslim women are not bound to dress modestly). Finally hijab is a religious obligation to every muslim women, it's not a social construct or ""a conspiracy of men oppress women."" So, even talking about this violets the 'Freedom of religion'."
1411,e7xpph4,"A nun joins the nunnery (nunhood?) by choice. Typically Muslim women are forced to cover themselves, be shamed and are told they are less than a man from childhood. There are actual laws in Muslim countries that say a woman must cover herself or be justifiably raped. There are laws that say a woman's testimony, especially towards rape, is worth half that of a man's. It is typically the woman's fault in these countries that she was raped because she didn't resist hard enough or was being provocative and therefore women are often shamed for being raped.

None of these instances the woman had a choice in making. Maybe in the US where a woman has an actual choice in being Muslim (aside from family pressure and violence) I can see hijabs and burkas okay because it's her choice. However, don't you dare tell me it's women empowerment. The hijab and burka is rooted in misogyny and sexism and always will be. Wear one if you want, but just know you are voluntarily wearing the chains that historically have kept women down in a large part of the world. And you're celebrating it..."
1412,e4sdp0t,"Aha see here comes the reductive argument, not taking anything I’ve said to justify what I’ve said previously, but instead prescribing motive and deciding where you classify the argument as stupid. Thanks mate but I don’t see another way forward, but I’ll recap for you.

&gt;No, I asked if you are justifying honour killings

&gt;No? How on earth did you came to that conclusion? You said ""honor killings are justified in the Qur'an"", and provided a verse. I pointed out that the verse didn't talk anything about killing anyone at all. I further pointed out if honor killings are actually mandated in the Scriptures, then there would not be a disparity of treatment on the issue across the globe.

Okay so here you’ve said that the verse says nothing about killing anyone, which is verifiably false, namely because -

&gt; Surah 4:15: “If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, take the evidence of four (reliable) witness from amongst you against them; **if they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them**. Or God ordain for them some (other) way.”

Do you remember when you said...

&gt;I pointed out that the verse didn’t talk anything about killing anyone at all

That? Because it specifically mentions killing someone because of lewdness.

&gt; The definition of lewdness is the quality of being very sexual or lustful in an offensive way. An example of lewdness is asking people for sexual favors on the streets

I’m gonna take a few liberties with this and assume that adultery likely comes under this also. Offence can take many forms, I’d assume a husband would likely take offence to a cheating spouse.

&gt;Let me outline how this travesty of a conversation came about.

&gt;1.	⁠You: ""we should ban head coverings to free Muslim women""

Yes, because it is culturally enforced by their husband. Those in Iran right now will tell you they are still forced to wear it despite it not being law, which points to it being a cultural thing. Women who do wear it by choice are absolutely free to do so there but the minority who would wear it are likely in a privileged position compared to the millions that are forced to wear it in the name of their husband’s force, which is derived through Islam and the Quran’s, leading to the country’s interpretation of obeying a man, whichever country that may be. That simple fact means any hijab, burqa, niqab, whatever, is a tool of oppression for a majority. We should remove severe oppression from a majority. The only way that I can see that happening is to initially remove it from all until the ideology is universally agreed to be wrong to force, which it currently is not. Once that has been achieved we can look at removing any ban. It’s the same concept as Trump’s travel ban.

&gt;2.	⁠Me: ""no, that's a horrible thing. If you care about Muslim women you will want to create an environment where they can freely choose what they want, rather than forcing them like their oppressive menfolk""

You haven’t condemned honour killings which typically happens to women. Other freedom infractions include but are not limited to: Bacha bazi, stoning gays, marrying young children to adults, the mere ideology of women’s rights in the most extreme countries like Saudi. Something tells me that this is not the biggest hill that Muslim women have to deal with, but it seems that many are coming out to condemn the allegation that they’re forced. Is it even possible they would be forced by their husband to say they condemn the allegations? I think it’s extremely likely.

&gt;3.	⁠You: ""no, all Muslim women are oppressed and can't make decision by themselves"" &lt;--- **this is where things are starting to get stupid**

I didn’t say they couldn’t make decisions for themselves, I said their husband’s make the choices for them. I seek to give women the agency to do whatever they want to.

&gt;4.	⁠Me: ""that's ridiculous. Muslim women, like any others, have their own agency. Some freely choose to don the scarf for their reasons. Why not respect that?""

That’s just a lie man. Women couldn’t drive in Saudi until very recently. You’re telling me that Saudi law doesn’t have deep roots in religious values provided by the Quran?

&gt;I am not an expert in Qur'anic interpretation (there are actual university degrees for that), but it's clear that you know even less than I am. How about you not quote that to support your arguments? ""We need to take away the freedom of Muslim women (to wear headscarves) in order to give them freedom"" - you can justify that secularly, without trying to quote the Qur'an.

I’ve quoted everything that has been said in the reply other than what I’ve said unless it’s needed for context. Regardless of your pedigree in said interpretation, you are able to discuss it. I don’t need to justify it secularly because it’s a Muslim issue. Nowhere in the rest of the world other than the Middle East are these types of issues a thing and it’s why critique is so difficult to defend. If it were an issue elsewhere then I would argue that also, but I would look at the culture of said country and question why it has come to pass.

I have read the Quran, your sentence...

&gt; but it's clear that you know even less than I am

1. Shows you’re calling me ignorant to the Quran, which I’ve already said I’m clearly not as I provided a quote to support my argument which you cannot refute without twisting it as you’ve done in this comment.

2. Says I cannot critique without being a scholar, which I definitely can. You can’t bring a sustainable defendable position, which isn’t my fault.

3. Is attempting to shut down an argument due to lack of education.

You haven’t shown me how, for example, the Saudi’s have reached a point where honour killings have come to pass and have been an issue for so long.

In your next comment I request that you condemn the following that I’ve mentioned in this comment -

&gt; Bacha bazi, stoning gays, marrying young children to adults, the mere ideology of women’s rights in the most extreme countries like Saudi

And others, that may come about due to memory, that infringes upon the safety and rights of anyone who lives in a culture with Muslim **based** values."
1413,e4tklah,"Assalamu alaykum

This is a frequently asked question. I remember answering a similar question before, so I'll paste my answer below.

Muslims must remain modest. The Qur'an says,

&gt;Say to the believers, that they cast down their eyes and guard their private parts; that is purer for them. God is aware of the things they work. (30) And say to the believing women, that they cast down their eyes' and guard their private parts, and reveal not their adornment save such as is outward; and **let them cast their veils over their bosoms**... (31) (Surah 24)

The last part of the second verse uses the word *khimar*. This refers to a cloth that covers the head. So, Muslim women are commanded to cover their **head** and **chest**.

The Qur'an also says,

&gt;O Prophet, say to thy wives and daughters and the believing women, **that they draw their veils close to them**; so it is likelier they will be known, and not hurt. God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate. (59) (Surah 33)

The word used in this verse is *jalabib*. This refers to a **loose outer garment**. This is why many Muslim women were loose dresses, to cover the rest of their body. They are not allowed to wear tight or figure-revealing clothing, because that is against the ruling in this verse.

Now, there are some women who cover the face. Many contemporary scholars say that it does not need to be covered. There's a difference of opinion regarding the face and hands being *awrah*. In Tafsir Jalalayn and Tafhim al-Qur'an, the interpretation of the part ""and reveal not their adornment save such as is outward"" is that it refers to the face and hands.

So, wearing a headscarf is mandatory according to the Qur'an. The minimum requirements from the Qur'an are to: cover the head, cover the neck and bosom, and to wear loose-fitting clothing. For the women who wear the niqab or burqa, this is simply a spiritual and personal choice and something that might help them feel closer to Allah; this is more than what is required. 

I hope this clarified the issue of hijab. Let me know if you have any questions!

*Allahu a'lam*"
1414,e5cq211,"On the Nuns, they do it out of their own will though. They're not forced to be Nuns. I can agree on the rest of the examples though.

1415,e5hko8t,"Lmao. Don't you understand that you are parroting old racist tropes? Yes many Muslim women (and non Muslim women) are oppressed around the world, including America. But to say hijab or islam is the main reason is simpleminded and naive.

1417,e5sid76,"&gt;Are you suggesting AfD is incapable of disseminating propaganda, or staging false flag attacks? 

No because everyone is capable of creating propaganda or false flag attacks, as we've seen from both the right and left.

&gt;And what culture, exactly, are you talking about? I ask because a fair amount of AfD propaganda invokes the burka, and that's not exactly a Syrian thing.


The culture of which the burka and hijab is forced upon women, to which the west has a disgusting fetish for. Even in Europe, Muslim women are harassed and attacked by other Muslims for not wearing a hijab. I've seen it personally happen many times to my friends while we were out in the city.

&gt;I'm sure it is a cultural thing, in that they disapprove of any culture that is Muslim, in the way German culture is Christian.

Countries like Germany is open to many cultures, except those who are bigoted and cause harm to other people.

&gt;I'm not sure how that's a defense, since Nazis weren't exactly culturally open.

Fun fact, the Nazis allied with Muslims to help them exterminate Jews because they both have a deep hatred for them. Even better is how Muslims still possess that deep hatred and has infiltrated schools where Jewish children are getting attacked for their religion by Muslims."

1423,e69hnej,"“Try not wearing one as a woman in those countries where it isn’t such a statement of feminism”

Hence the *need* for feminism, and the whole point of the graphic.

Again. This isn’t anti-Mormon. Or even anti-religion. It’s a cartoon that visualizes the need for feminism and progression *within* religion. 

Regardless of the religion, the symbol, the region it dominates, or the consequence of noncompliance, oppression of women is wrong. *That* is the point of this post. Not to argue that hijabs are non religious, that they are equal to crosses, that all Muslim women are empowered by taking off their hijab, or even that I think everyone should get naked. 

Just, only, purely, entirely, that we need feminism. religion especially needs feminism, because religious freedom and feminism is a woman’s right to choose to worship (or not) in a way that is empowering to *her* , and not at the mercy of men. 

Specifically Mormon women, because this is, after all, r/exmormon, and discussion of garment-based modesty and recovering from damage done by shoulder-shaming is part of the purpose of this sub. "
1424,e31fdor,"&gt; How can Muslim men tolerate that their Hijab-wearing female family members are prone to be attacked when they go out and not attempt to immigrate from this country?

Ok... So the women should leave for a country that may or may not be better for them. What about their families and connections here? Jobs? School? Dreams?

&gt; In the case of USA, didn’t they immigrate to it and left back in their original countries commitments and responsibilities for assumingely better country? 

Are you really saying that no Muslim women are born in the USA? Regardless, it is incredibly difficult for those who do uproot themselves and attempt to make a life in the US, and few people would want to throw away all that effort unless there is a very good reason to do so.

&gt; They need to do that again if they care about their personal safety and obeying Allah’s orders by wearing the hijab.

You are describing this in very black and white terms that lack the nuances of reality."
1425,e3lkgow,"&gt; Wow your a tough guy who doesn't have feelings for sisters.

I said I don't care about the feelings of SHAMELESS immodestly dressed sisters. I made a main post on here about just what types of immodest sisters there are. You seriously expect me to care or have feelings for immodest sisters who could best be described as, and I dislike using this word, a ""thot"" who wears the tightest pants she can find, uploads duckface and or inappropriate selfies on the internet, wears Kim Kardashian levels of makeup, and all around wears seductive levels of perfume, etc? Most people don't understand, but mercy is earned, not merely given on account of being a female. In my post I explained that one category of immodest sister deserves mercy (as they have shame about their actions and don't exceed their limits) while the other category don't (as they have zero shame about their actions and constantly exceed their limits). 

I suggest you learn to demarcate the difference between the two, otherwise you are insulting the struggle of the better category of sisters by insinuating that the other worse category of sisters are ""struggling"". 

&gt; I am sure you have a mother and possibly a sister . Hey I am sure you want to get married someday as well. Think about your words before you speak because someday someone may hurt your mother's feelings or your sisters feelings with that same attitude you are presenting now.

Actually my mother and sister are full blown misandrists who blame all the world's woes (literally) on men. They constantly blame men (and by extension my father) for every problem in their life, without reflecting on their own inabilities and they constantly say that they don't need men in their life. And them being misandrists has zero to do with any actual experience with bad men. My mother was pampered by her father and never was hit by either her father or my father. My father is a kind and hard-working soul whose only real character issues are that he is stingy with money and is a bit unfiltered in his manners, not that he is offensive but you get what I mean (I blame it on him growing up in a poor family and having to penny pinch and not really learning proper social etiquette) She had 0.00000% experience with any form of sexual harassment both when she was young and when she was older. My sister is the same, never dealt with any sexual harassment before, never was once hit by my father, and all around was fairly privileged as far as things go no less due to my father giving his all for her to grow up successful. There is also the fact that my mother cares a lot more about her career and as such when we were young she hardly spend time with my sister and I, and so my father had to not only work but he had to become a househusband, with everything a housewife typically does (including showing love) and still does. My mother also demeans him for being a househusband and not making more money. Also my mother also constantly demeans me and my flaws and tends to mock me ever since I was a young teenager, but if my father so much as points out that she loves to go around mocking and criticising others but herself doesn't wear hijab then she gets all mad. My sister also mocks me to a point where she degrades my dignity in front of our relatives and others due to once again some issues that I have like being slightly forgetful, etc.  

So yeah, I could care less about hurting the feelings of sisters (of whom most are misandrists even though they deny it). Why is it that sisters can so casually be man-haters (being married to a man doesn't mean you can't be a misandrist) but when guys so much as generally criticise sisters all of a sudden we are the bad guys? And please, don't tell me that its because most sisters are exposed to ""bad men"" and that's why they are misandrists. Most haven't been truly exposed to bad men and have been very much sheltered/protected by good men they owe more thanks to. Your other point reminds of how many sisters will say such hateful/spiteful things against men in general that I always ask ""would you say that to your father? Your brother?"" To which their response is ""No, but I will say it to bad men. My father/brother are good men and I wouldn't say this to them"". So kind of similar to what I am saying, that is there are ""good sisters"" and ""bad sisters"". harshly advise the bad, afford mercy to the good. 


&gt; Hey you could even hurt your future wife's feelings with that attitude. I am sure you will have really tough conditions in your house.

Depends, if she shows me the self same misandrist attitude. Well I would firstly seek a divorce and not be married to such a she-witch. You seem to think I treat all women like this, when I keep telling you it is toward women who themselves are hateful and misandrists and or whose actions cause a fitna for the ummah and they are shameless/selfish and don't care about that. Which is why I won't make the same mistake my father warned me about, and that is to not marry a misandrist/selfish woman in the first place. 

&gt;What do they call it a Lion in the House a Sheep in the Street.

More like I treat others the way they treat me and by extension others. If she gonna be a rapid man-hater/public cause for fitna, then she gonna recieve a dose of her own medicine. 


&gt;That is why I will pray for you and others like you. May Allah Guide us all. We all could use some guidance and blessings.

You know, you remind me of my father. When he was young he was just like you, as his mother and sister were blessings to him and helped him to become the man he eventually became. Until he married my misandrist mother, of whom it is a shame that she gave him a rude awakening about the reality of how some muslim women are nowadays. Funnily enough, my father still tells me that not all women are like my mother and sister, and that most other women are deserving of kindness and mercy. I want to believe that so bad, but my personal experiences tell me that such muslim women are an ever decreasing minority. 

"
1426,e3rhwxm,"First, some data to prove that Muslim women are indeed wearing the hijab more, even in Western countries. The Canadian polling firm Environics made surveys of Muslim Canadian attitudes and values in 2006 and 2016. Here are the relevant results:

As to women's relationship to religion and ""oppression"", I think historically speaking, women tend to be more religious, more socially conformist and desire more social control of individual behavior than men. (Note: from here on I'll talk about statistical trends, claims made are not to be assumed true of all individuals, but to be about noticeable trends in groups) Remember that the first female politician elected in the US was elected on a Prohibition Party ticket, and women were the main force behind Prohibition. In Mexico, the liberal secularist revolutionaries of the early 20th century waited a long time to give women the vote because they thought they were more religious and conservative and would vote in more pro-Catholic parties, undermining the Mexican Revolution. And considering the crucial support Mexican women gave to the Cristeros uprising, they seemed to have been right.

 [Pew Study: Women More Religious Than Men](https://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/faith-and-values/civil-religion/pew-study-women-more-religious-than-men/article_a7946196-59b1-562a-b6d3-4fc09bb4038f.html)

Yes, right now women vote for the left, but that's a recent development since the 70s or 80s. Meaning that as progressives became culturally dominant, women became more progressive. And progressives moved away from ideas of personal freedom to ideas of social control of individual behavior for the ""common good"". After all, do feminists not say ""the personal is political""? Puritanical women of the 19th century couldn't agree more.

Anyway, that aside, why do Muslim women wear the veil more? I'd say there are two main factors:

First, in a world where countries and communities are ever more diverse due to mass migration, there is a tendency among cultural groups to want to claim some identity marker to broadcast their difference and belonging to a particular group. Belonging is a human need, in a modern world that is ever more atomized, people are likely to latch on to visible signs of their belonging to a social identity.

Second, societies in the West and in the Muslim world have shifted. Secular nationalism is weakening, the West adopting multiculturalism instead, promoting diversity rather than a shared identity. Many people in the West are openly advocating for Muslim women to wear the veil and celebrate it as a sign of ""diversity"" and inclusion. And much of the Muslim world is turning its back on modernist nationalism and going back to more traditional religious values."
1427,e3tif8m,"As a Muslim woman observing Islam, I am fully supportive of Boris Johnson’s rejection of the niqab. And I wonder how many of the former Foreign Secretary’s critics understand my religion, what this form of dress represents and the subjugation it implies. To defend the niqab and to defend Muslim women are, I can assure you, two very different things indeed.

Growing up Muslim in Britain, not once was I compelled to cover my hair. This changed when I moved to Saudi Arabia to practice medicine. Arriving in the Kingdom, by Saudi Arabia’s Sharia law, I could not go out into public without concealing my entire body, save face and hands, in a flowing, black abayya. This was my first experience of enforced veiling. And my last.

But even there, in the pre-9/11 Saudi Kingdom, the epicenter of Islam, the niqab (which covers most of the face) was not adopted by most women. Only the ultra-orthodox ones following Wahabisim or, perhaps, tribal Bedouins. And even these women, the most rural Bedouin women I treated while working there as a doctor, bore serious facial sun damage and tribal tattoos to their faces – indicating their faces were not veiled from sight or light for whole lifetimes.

Twenty years later, while Saudi Arabia is itself liberalizing, the niqab is increasingly adopted by Muslim women living in the West, often as an anti-Western pro-Islamist political statement opposing secularism. For this reason, Denmark has legalized the ban on the niqab – a move I strongly supported in Denmark’s leading newspaper Politiken. Women wearing a niqab in public in Denmark are now in violation of the law and can be forcibly removed from the public space. Most commendably, Danish law now prosecutes any individual compelling a Muslim woman or girl to wear the niqab.

This ban follows other bans on the niqab first initiated in 2011 by then French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel in December 2016 supported legalizing a niqab ban ‘by all means’. In Bavaria, the full-face veil is now legally banned. Austria followed suit in January 2017. Belgium has had a full-face veil ban in effect since 2011. We can expect more European states to follow suit.

When Boris Johnson mocks the niqab, he is emphatically not mocking Muslim women because – and this is a point that we Muslims seem to be unable to get across to non-Muslims – there is no basis in Islam for the niqab. Claiming otherwise is a profound distortion of Islamic belief. That’s why Muslim nations are themselves regulating and banning the niqab and burqa – as in both Morocco and Turkey where these coverings are seen as an invasion of Salafist affinities and a risk to national security and societal integrity.

My religion certainly does mandate modesty. In the early Islamic period, the word khimar, ‘veil,’ did not connote face or even head covering. In the Quran, Sura 24:31, the reference to ‘khimar’ reminds Muslim women of the need to ‘draw…[it] over their bosoms’ as integral to female modesty. Similarly, the verse of the veil commanded only the prophet Muhammad’s wives, to speak from behind a ‘hijab,’ meaning a curtain within the Prophet’s home (Quran Sura 33:53), their privacy being a mark of their high distinction.

Later traditions asserting khimar to specifically mean ‘niqab’ may have been fabricated. Records show Aisha – known to Muslims as the Mother of the Faithful in recognition of both her eminence among Prophet Muhammed’s wives as a great scholar and as the foremost teacher of early Muslims – provided great detail on the color and fabric of the khimars in her day. Aisha was known as the ‘One with Red Hair’ as the Prophet himself referred to her, suggesting her head and hair were uncovered in public. Nonetheless, no record exists as to how exactly khimars were worn and which parts of the body were to be covered with these elaborate cloths.

This convenient vacuum has allowed some to insert their own interpretation of veiling, for their own motives, including enforcing gender segregation and even gender apartheid, while also portraying Muslims in Europe as besieged by the false construct of Islamophobia which capitalizes on a false victimhood that so empowers Islamists as the persecuted darlings of blind liberalism. It is this blind liberalism that is now baying for Boris Johnson’s blood unaware that their indignation and calls of ‘Islamophobia’ do not protect Muslims but instead empower an Islamism that further dominates pluralist Islam.

Literal interpretations of the veil, derived largely by Muslims ignorant of the true dictates of our own religion, are derived from cultural misogyny. Thus, with their bans on the niqab, neither France, nor Germany nor Denmark are impinging on religious freedom. Instead they are legislating anti-democratic cultural mores that do indeed repress women living within their societies.

In the holiest sanctuary of Islam, in Mecca at the Ka’aba, facial covering is forbidden by Islam. There is no evidence in Islam that veiling of the face is either religious or required. In fact, it is actively discouraged at the time of a Muslim’s greatest act of religious devotion – during Hajj.

Today the adoption of the full-face veil, particularly in the modern secular world is far worse than looking like a letterbox. It’s both a symbol of cultural misogyny and a political marker for Islamist sympathies. The detractors of Mr Johnson would do better to consider their own role in marginalizing true, civil, pluralist Islam in favor of its anti-secular anti-democratic variant, Islamism.

The jihadis want to present their bizarre dress code as the face of Islam, and for that they need useful (non-Islamic) idiots in the West to help them do so. I will not be the only British Muslim woman who is thankful that Boris Johnson is not playing along."
1428,e40n9w6,"I don't mean to imply most Muslim women are wearing Niqab but I think hijab's are hardly that much better because the implication behind them is still the same.
I'm glad to see Muslims become more liberal but it's dishonest to say people freely choose to wear a hijab. Unless they're converts, it's a 'choice' that often comes from social pressure and shaming. I do actually know some Muslim women who don't wear hijab's but they're culturally Muslim more than actually religious. 

As a feminist I really dislike the concept of women covering their hair in order to be modest and protect themselves from the male gaze and worse. Hijabs and head-covering exists because of misogyny so even if a woman is thrilled to wear one she is still engaging in a misogynistic practice and I don't like it. I can't force anyone to do anything neither would I want to but I wish they didn't feel like they have to behave any differently than men. I bet if you asked most Muslim girls they would say their brothers were treated very differently growing up. Muslim women are perpetrating strict gender roles that harm themselves and harm society as a whole. "
1429,e47z0ks,"Do you face any social pressure to wear a hijab? If so, I don't believe it's free will. Why don't Muslim men cover themselves in the same way as Muslim women are often expected to?

I can't see it as anything other than a display of misogyny. Wear what you want but you do not get to dictate whether you'll receive criticism for wearing clothing that many associate with the religious oppression of women. I feel the same about any religious modesty women are expected to follow within ANY religion. "
1430,e4f1yj5,"Anyone who knows ANYTHING about Islam knows that the very premise of an observant Muslima leaving the home unchaperoned (let alone being employed as a cop!) **is absurd.** But increasingly, many ""moderate"" (read *lax*) Muslim women are wearing the hijab as a statement of social-political identity (whereas its actual intent is to keep strange eyes off one's womenfolk.)

This is why ""moderate"" Muslims are problematic. Due to their community loyalties and lack of influence upon actual (as practiced and preached in mosques) Islam, they just wind up becoming a ""beard"" for the unreformed majority of Imams to hide behind when convenient (since deceiving kafirs in the waging of jihad isn't a sin.)"
1431,e14ipf1,"Sometimes it is not even the niqabis, I had an Egyptian teacher (1 on 1 class at her house) that always wore the hijab in front of me even though I am a female, had no cameras or phones in my hands and have lived in Muslims majority countries so I am familiar with the rules of modesty.

Her husband who is a convert then told me on one occasion that his wife was in the belief that no Muslim women are to be treated as men when it comes to how you dress in front of them since they don't have the same sense of shame that Muslim women have and cannot be trusted when it comes to telling others how the Muslim lady looks like. To me this was hilarious."
1432,e1clxy0,"&gt; It's wrong to think that women do not defend the hijab as much as men, though. Muslim women are some of the strongest firebrands in the entire religion, and often times in the West they're the ones at the forefront of Islamization.

Just like the overrepresentation of lesbians in supposed ""women's"" organizations, it's the loudest that get heard. My guess is those women are also likely a minority, and just like the dykes, they probably bully others into compliance."
1433,e1dhhm9,"Spent 6 months deployed in Saudi Arabia.  Muslim women are covered up, period.  Less than 20 years ago not wearing a Hijab would result in quite the beating in public.  I've never been to a place in my life that was more restrictive of women and non-muslims.  Stepping foot alone in many stores in Riyadh (a place seemingly more progressive than the rest of the country) as a woman can result in harm..."
1434,e1dljz4,"&gt; Doesn't matter if it's in Saudi Arabia or USA. Patriarchal societal standards become ingrained,

The difference is that Saudia Arabia has laws about adhering to religious standards, while the United States does not. You don't get sent to jail because you refuse to wear a hijab in the United States like they do in Iran and other countries currently. The choice is able to be made - the government should not be making it for anyone. That's my point.

Oppression works both ways.

&gt; I don't understand feminist one minute women have no choice due to how ingrained society patriarchy teaches women to be diminutive bores and the next second Muslim women are actually somehow able to overcome the harshest forms of a sexist patriarchal society and freely choose a veil?

I don't recall being a feminist. I just disagree with the Netherlands and other countries banning clothing for stupid reasons. Also, I am entirely sure what you're saying if you could explain the comment a bit more."
1435,e1dq8nk,"Muslim women are the only ones covering themselves up like this . For Denmark, it was decided in parlament that this was not very danish at all and it should be included in the already-in-place masking law.

Since youre pushing this to be an islamophobia discussion,it should be worth noting that the hijab is not banned, and the garments like the burka that will be banned is worn by only a couple of hundred of women in denmark (0.002% of the population)"
1436,e1fdkmq,"*Any* religious text varies in degree of interpretation and how much that particular interpretation is enforced under  a specific areas laws if at all. 

Islam receives a lot of attention regarding laws on what women may wear and certainly there are several counties with very specific and very restrictive clothing with the [burqa probably being the most well known in that capacity](https://www.unilad.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/8812UNILAD-imageoptim-22_niqabgraphic2-channel-4.jpg) 

However- Christian, Jewish, and even atheist women are also subject to varying amounts of covering due to either cultural/religious traditions or laws originally based in religion, but are now seen as a cultural norm. 

Consider Mennonite and Amish attire. Look at the requirements for 7th day adventist and Mormon modesty. There's memes about babushkas in russia, but the women aren't wearing them because their hair is going grey. 

You know how in most of the US women can't be topless but men can? that comes directly from modesty laws. Even many public schools will not allow girls to have a hemline above the knee in their dress code books (even if they don't enforce it anymore) or spaghetti strap tank tops and dresses. There are laws regarding how much percentage of the ass must be covered by bikinis. However, in many European countries, women may go topless on the beach or even be naked. So can men. 

Did you know that ion many state houses (within the chambers), men must remove their hats but women may keep them on? The same thing with many court houses. 

In certain Jewish sects, women's hair must always be covered. Women will often wear wigs which, imo, is more of a letter than spirit of the law sort of thing. Women can't tour certain buildings in Italy (Probably other places too, but I had this experience) if they're wearing shorts or tank tops. 

Historically speaking, in the US, women didn't even wear pants on TV until Mary Tyler-Moore did it and it *blew people's minds* Leaving the house without a hat would be immodest, having your hair *down* or cut short was unnacceptable, dresses must cover xyz. This stuff really isn't that long ago.

And keep in mind- much of this is *not* restricted to women. Men in much of the world and under many religions have dress codes as well. People so frequently talk about hijab and chandor without bringing up beards or head coverings or other modesty restrictions with men. 

This is not to say that these are equally enforced (they're not) or even equal in severity (they're not) but just to point out that Islam is not the only culture that has them. Almost *all* cultures have them to varying degrees even if we don't notice them- and we do tend to not notice things that are part of our own cultural norm. 

Last thing- keep in mind that many, many, many muslim women are not *forced* to participate in this. Some choose not to at all. Some only do it for certain occasions or visiting certain relatives. Some opt to do it as a show of faith despite the fact no one else in their family does. Some are brought up that way and feel more comfortable that way or are too worried about displeasing those they love (and that's a longer conversation about upbringing and tradition that also has parallels in every other culture)

If you want more on how religion impacts dress I highly suggest /r/askhistorians or /r/askanthropology. A lot of people in either place could probably give you enough info to write a term paper. 
"
1437,e1fey5k,"&gt; Muslim women are the only ones covering themselves up like this . For Denmark, it was decided in parlament that this was not very danish at all and it should be included in the already-in-place masking law.

That's exactly my point. This change isn't about ""men and women in Denmark should not hide their faces"". It's a very clear law targeted at Muslim women wearing burqas.

But way to go to put ""being danish"" into your law. So much for being a free country. ""Free"" as long the citizens behave exactly as you want.

&gt; Since youre pushing this to be an islamophobia discussion,it should be worth noting that the hijab is not banned

Do you want praise for that? But don't worry, I have no worry that the hijab will be targeted in the near future as well.

&gt; and the garments like the burka that will be banned is worn by only a couple of hundred of women in denmark (0.002% of the population)

Which makes this even more of an non issue and shows that this is mostly about ""looking strong against Islam"". How pathetic."
1438,e1gakzd,"Wow, you are much braver than me!! Im not even there yet with the clothes, my mom would probably lock in my room if I dared do something like that.

And yes, muslim women are the worst. My mom gives me shit just for wearing a bit of make-up, as if Im whoring myself out. I avoid to go in front of her if Im wearinf foundation and put lipstick on when Im out. This is the least I do to feel good about myself. I absolutely despise the hijab and how I have to wear long ass shirts to cover my ass. 

Like what is the deal with these women, they cant stand others’ freedom and suffocate their own freedom?!!!! 

Cant wait to graduate and be out of there. I feel like throughout my whole journey as an exmuslim (in the closet) my mom gave me the most shit. And havent even done anything agaisnt their stupid rules or their fucked up religion. I feel like if she didnt abuse me so much verbally and also did physically (in the past), I probably wouldnt have hated the religion or culture so much.

1439,e1jouwb,"&gt;I am a 20-year-old student at a liberal college.

Ah, this explains everything... ^^/s

But jokes aside, this article is kinda troubling.

&gt;I am automatically held to a different standard, assumed to be deeply religious rather than secular — an assumption that works the opposite way for just about everyone else.

Isn't that kind of how it's supposed to work for both Muslim men and women? Maybe not being presumed deeply religious but at least not being secular. What's the point of being a secular (nonreligious) Muslim? *How* can one even be a secular Muslim? 

&gt;There is a practical problem posed by virtue of your environment: Where are the Muslim boys? What happens when you develop a crush on, say, Mike from your Politics of the Middle East class? How does one convert beer-guzzling, Patriots-watching, frat-partying, flag-waving Mike to Islam? Does Mike even like you, or does he just want your notes from last week?

Does she not think this is an issue for Muslim men too? Also we live in the 21st century, if people before the Internet living far apart could make halal choices then, we can surely make them now.

&gt;For me, “hoejabi” symbolizes the way that Muslim women are never granted that middle ground — the word itself is a bridge. It’s empowering, and more important, it’s hilarious. (If you’re not a Muslim woman, don’t even think about using it.)

Again, if you're a Muslim man or woman, the reason you're not granted a middle ground isn't defined by other people, it's defined by your faith and religion. If you want to be assumed to be secular and non-practising you might as well stop calling yourself Muslim. It's very obvious from this article that she doesn't really like her faith and she feels forced in it. I don't see how any woman who wears a hijab could find the term ""hoejabi"" empowering, a ""hoejabi"" is an oxymoron. (I don't even want to talk about the gatekeeping and ""muh culture"" sentence lmao)

&gt;The way that she has been made to wear the shame of an industry out of her control is unacceptable.

But she chose to go into adult entertainment knowing that it's wrong? Don't want to be that guy but I doubt she's a practising Muslim, hijab might just be her gimmick or something. I agree that she shouldn't receive death threats or violence, and that we should just ignore her

&gt;It’s not a Muslim girl thing; it’s a Romaissaa thing.

This should have been the first line of the article. This article shouldn't be taken as the belief of all hijabis, and I'm sure it infuriates some women out there as well. 

And honestly, the feeling I get from most of the article is that she's lacking in her faith and that she doesn't really wanna be Muslim or perceived as religious. She's grasping at straws and other issues to hide her main issue, she probably just wants her own version of Islam or to leave it all together but keep the Muslim demonym. I say to her, and all the ""cultural Muslims"" out there, what's the point of calling yourself Muslims if you don't even believe in Allah?"

Male Muslims shouldn't be looked to as a domestic abuser while walking down a street beside a mother and a sister wearing a Hijab.

Also modern Muslim societies (Unless it's in Iran or Saudi Arabia) clearly accepts a woman without a Hijab nowadays."
1441,e1prhmh,"Most likely ""liberal open-minded"" westerners that don't like any opinion that goes against what they personally believe. If one woman is forced into wearing the hijab, all Muslim women are. If they meet a woman that genuinely wants to wear it, she must be brainwashed. I've seen this a million times. "
1442,e1vvke2,"&gt;Most Muslim women don't choose to wear Burka's

Firstly, it's a hijab, burka covers the face, secondly, most Muslim women are living in Asia instead of the middle East and are wearing them by choice"
1443,e1ydwhn,"I agree that most Muslims are uneducated on their religion. It was that reason that lead to my leaving Islam.
I’ve read the entire Quran - in english. And boy it held some revelations on the unauthenticity of most Islamic practices. 

Before, like many others, only in arabic. I realized there was no point to that.

And then I became disillusioned with Islam. I already did not like hadith because many were not so great, like killing black dogs because they were devils. 


The first caliphs held the same view. They wanted Islam to be Quran based, which I agreed with. “You are transmitting conflicting hadiths that clash with the sayings of the Prophet. The persons to come after you will be in a worse predicament. Transmit no hadiths from God’s messenger. Speak to those who would like you to transmit hadiths in the following way: “Behold! God’s book is with us, abide by what has been made lawful for you therein and avoid what has been prohibited.” this is from Abu Bakr.

There’s even a Hadith that says to kill renegades. Even though there is supposedly no coercion in religion.  The Hadith are full of awful things, like stoning a man to death for illegal sexual intercourse, torture(holding heated nails over eyes). However, in another Hadith (all sahih, btw) the prophet just orders lashings of adulterers. 

Hell, even in the Quran it says the only people who stone others to death are disbelievers.

There is the law of qisas/equivalence in the Quran as well. But there is a hadith where it says a Muslim shall not be killed in equivalence for killing a disbeliever. 

Now, I find this one absolutely awful. Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: Once, the messenger of Allah (PBUH) went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) of `Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by a women and said, “O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women).” They asked, “Why is it so, O messenger of Allah (PBUH) ?” He replied, “You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you (women). A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you.” The women asked, “O messenger of Allah (PBUH)! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?” He said, “Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?” They replied in the affirmative. He said, “This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?” The women replied in the affirmative. He said, “This is the deficiency in her religion.”

“The parchment on which the verse about stoning to death for adultery was written, was eaten and abrogated by a goat.” This is sahih.

But- this is clearly contradictory to the Quran.
“nothing can abrogate His words” (6:115)

As you can see, there’s a reason I abandoned Hadith. It’s contradictory and despicable at times.

Hell, in Egypt women are still circumcised due to a Hadith saying for women to be!



And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith (9:3)

But the Quran says NO COMPULSION in religion!?

 The Quran also, as mentioned previously, says it can never be changed throughout time. But in my experience, with different translations, this is untrue. 

One verse I was torn on (morally) was 4:34. Basically, if your wife doesn’t want to smash you, you can BEAT her.
Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

However, in another translation I had read it said only to shun the wife, not beat. Which is better, so that made me happier at the time I was reading the Quran. 


I’ll talk about something else now. Muslim practices versus Islam. 

The Quran says it by itself is the only source of Islam, and to reject other sources (even uses the word hadith for sources!)

And nowhere in the Quran does it mention hijab. Only that women cover their privates and not draw attention. In fact, hijab did start as a judeo Christian tradition. Yet we see almost all Muslim women wear hijab or niqab. It’s no secret Muslim women are oppressed. 


There’s a reason I’m no longer Muslim. Islam’s practices are unbased, the people are fractured over meaningless historical conflict, the Quran and Hadith are contradictory internally and to each other.  Most of Islam, as you said, is cultural silliness. Like the five prayers or hijab. There’s only 3 daily mentioned in the Quran.

Practice as you will, but don’t assume I am uneducated. My research only made me more disillusioned. It’s sad many Muslims don’t truly read their own holy book in a language they understand.

Viktig å være presentabel når man bikker tosifra alder. Neida, men det er fortsatt helt latterlig. Det kan vell sies at det brukes for å uttrykke kulturell identitet, men hvilket behov har et barn for dette? Det er da i all hovedsak påtvunget av foreldrene og å påstå annet er svada. "
1445,e28zuvw,"Most of your assumptions seems to be based on a western idea of what feminism should be about. Muslim women in large are not given any platform within that cause feminism in western nations are largely white. There is no use criticising the hijab or niqab if you do not include women who actually do wear it freely to be involved in that discussion. Nobody questions a nun wearing what is technically a hijab-like dress cause we assume that they are devoting themselves to religion yet its fine that we assume all muslim women are oppressed?? This is where your ignorence and to be honest xenophobia shows. You are brushing all the women of a particular religion into one group and feel the need to ""rescue"" them. That is peak arrogance. Yes there is a lot of muslim women who are oppressed, be it for religion or cultural reasons but stop pretending that you are some sort of uber feminist. Anybody who thinks what another person needs whilst that person is already is being controlled, os no different than the bully."
1446,e293en0,"&gt; Muslim women are legally required to wear hijab in public in Saudi Arabia [1] and the Indonesian Aceh province,[2] and all women are required to do so in Iran.[3]

I had a moment of confusion and was thinking about the hijab, not the niqab. 

The fact that the hijab is legally required in some areas does still pertain to the difference between high heels and the niqab. In the western world, the niqab is seen as an extension of the hijab. A more extreme version of the same thing. So while the niqab itself isn't mandatory, the fact that Westerners consider it to be an extreme version of the hijab which is required puts those two on similar ground. 

I'd also argue that high-heels have literally no religious connotation, which cannot be said for the niqab. Another difference. Also, one is footwear and the other obscures the face. There's plenty of differences between the two."
1447,e299xl1,"First off I love Texas, Lovelady just outside Crockett in East Texas was a second home as a kid :) 

Religion is just a hard subject to be direct about with getting jumped on immediately.. I think we can safely say they are not that strict or if Sex In The City 2 is anything to go by all Muslim women are apparently wearing designer clothing under their hijabs and burkhas anyways.

I have a muslim brother in law from Abu Dhabi after the first year he got less strict on the hijab stuff with my sis so im not sure if its a cultural shift to, there are 3 main branches of Islam that all want to kill or dominate eachother (Shia/Sunni/Wahabi) so it would also make sense for some to be less strict unlike the Wahabi Saudis.

1448,e2gseb6,"First of all, as a Muslim woman, I personally do not wear burka but I wear the hijab. 

I think that the Netherlands has every right to ban the burka for reasons such as it covers people’s faces as that shouldn’t be happening on public transport, in hospitals, etc. 

What I do NOT agree with is people in this thread acting as if Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab and as if the hijab is a oppressive piece of clothing that silences women and controls them. 

Yes, there are certain countries that force their women to wear hijab, and yes, there are certain cultures associated with Islam that oppress their women in the name of religion. But this is not true for every culture and this is not true for every Muslim woman. 

Please try to understand that not everyone is forced to wear the hijab and it is in fact a personal choice, not a forced one. "

LOL. I disagree, Islam is not like communism. And Islam has worked many times before to govern a state. 

&gt;It just doesn't, Islam is directly against democracy and liberty

What do you mean by ""democracy"" and ""liberty""? and please show me proof of this claim after you explain what those words mean? 

&gt;Muslims either want to go full Islamic state or everyone cherry picks according to their own beliefs which creates a vague state like ours. 

And what is wrong with ***Muslims in Muslim countries wanting their country to be ruled by Islam?*** 

IF the majority of Muslims in Tunisia or other Muslim countries want to have an Islamic government then that's their right and there's nothing wrong with it. And you still don't like it EVEN when people cherry pick according to their own beliefs? that's what many Muslims living in Muslim countries do. And how does that make Tunisia a ""vague state""?  

&gt;Imo if we want to improve, we make Tunisia secular

So do you want Tunisia to have a secular system like the one in France where Muslim women are banned from wearing hijab in public schools?

1452,dzvnw4i,"The right to not cover their own bodies if they please? I get it if Muslim women are being forced to wear the hijab/niqab in Middle Eastern countries, that’s horrible and a violation of their rights. But it should go the other way too."
1453,dzvqn6b,"I genuinely do not like the belief that ALL Muslim women are forced to wear the niqab or hijab. Yes, there are some who are forced but there are also some who are not. But assuming that ALL are forced doesn't bring a balance between freedom and religion"
1454,dzxrq6n,"Unless you're arguing that Islamic jurisprudence, both in the past and the present, is nothing more than a bourgeois infested field, I honestly don't see the logic of that statement. Though I would argue that I'm not fully convinced that wearing the Niqab is somehow obligatory, as many of these women believe, it is nevertheless imposed on many women on *religious* grounds and is simply an extreme version of the hijab. If anybody knows anything about Hijab, it's that you can find if unambiguously in the Quran and the reasons why 'God' chooses to impose this on women is made clear. 

However, telling us that we can't tell women what to wear, though I agree with that, might as well be like saying ""don't tell women what they can and can't wear, but I'll ignore that Muslim women are forced to wear this symbol of male dominance on religious grounds which Muslim communities reinforce by shaming those who don't wear it."" It's almost like, they're being forced to wear it...

Ah, tis the glory of being a social libertarian. "

1456,e01bmaq,"That sounds a lot like what people used to say about Kennedy: He couldn't be trusted because, as a Catholic, he took guidance from the Vatican. As a Catholic-raised Irish-American, I'm glad those anti-Irish/anti-Catholic sentiments have mostly gone away in America. As a teacher of students who wear the Hijab, I'm hopeful that the same will happen to anti-Muslim/anti-Arab (or, in my city, anti-Somali) prejudice. 

People who wear the Hijab are individuals. While it's obviously a religious symbol, cultural, political, and personal factors also affect whether a person covers or not. Some of my students take off their Hijab at school, and others modify it to make it more like a hair wrap. I have students who fast for Ramadan and are very religious who take off or modify their Hijab at school. I have students who don't fast and don't seem to be very religious who are strict about wearing the Hijab for cultural reasons. I know someone who's from a Muslim family that doesn't cover (not all Muslim women do), but started covering mostly as a political statement against Donald Trump. 

When people live in countries that control women's choice, like Denmark or Saudi Arabia, Muslim women are not allowed to make the choice to cover or not their own, but have it legislated by others. "
1457,e02ocmh,"I read it. All (but one) of the scholarly opinions are entirely consistent with each other - the author thinks there's a difference because he doesn't take into account that they are addressing slight differences in the same issue (e.g. 18-20 hour fasts vs. the sun never setting) 

The author, from his flawed understanding of the issue, (he leaves out evidence, such as his failure to consider ayat and hadith that clarify the concept of hardship) then manufactures a disagreement that doesn't exist. There may be a small number of people who are so inflexible that they would disagree, but not even Islamqa.info (a site restrictive enough that most people on this sub don't like it) has any disagreement with the consensus view. 

Let's get to that one inconsistent opinion, now. That is the opinion of ""Ibn Yusuf Khalil,"" whose opinion is outside of the consensus. His article takes you to a site with articles by people like Asra Nomani, and ones that claim hijab is not required. This is not a place to go for guidance, especially not when there are many other, more reputable sources.

Meanwhile, the author of the original piece apparently thinks he knows better than 1400+ years of Islamic scholarship in claiming that, by his interpretation of words like ""Kafir"" and ""mushrik,"" (which is somehow a superior understanding than that of 1400+ years of scholarship) Muslim women are permitted to marry non-Muslim men, an issue that is absolutely settled. 

If I were you, I wouldn't be getting my guidance from people who think they alone have figured out the truth, and thousands of scholars throughout the centuries all got it wrong.  

I'm reminded of [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zab5sSmOHqc) by Adbul Hakim Murad, in which he explains that the overly restrictive ISIS-types and the overly permissive ""progressive"" types have the same fundamental flaw in their reasoning. "

My mother wears the hijab and covers her hair in public, as is her right by the constitution of the United States. You should educate yourself about how normal Muslims live their lives instead of taking what the media portrays as fact. The majority of Muslims living in the West do in fact adapt to the customs of the country they are living in, but still adhere to aspects of their religion depending on their individual religiosity. 

If you want to ban covering yourself in public, then you will have to ban the way Catholic nuns and orthodox Jewish women dress as well. Catholic nuns have the exact same dress code as observant Muslim women. Are you willing to ban Christian traditions as well?

I have been to Saudi Arabia and have seen Western women walking around wearing only abaya and no burqa or hijab. You can research the law of the country, which only imposes the hijab on Muslim women, although it is still better to wear the hijab in some conservative areas such as Riyadh. Just because you read something in the news doesn't mean it is fact.

1464,e0lejw5,"Hope, I try my level best to explain my point as far as I came to know
Islam allows women to cover the head and for men up to the knee. But not for force if Muslim women don't want to wear hijab, according to Islam don't force them to wear, same goes for the men, According to Quran whenever you see opposite sex, just lower your gaze from his/her  for both. Arabs men having biceps and revealing their figure, so whenever Muslim look people of opposite gender lower their gaze, this is the command of Islam if they don't do, they don't practice Islam. If you visit another country like India here if you reveal your belly navel people will look at you in an inappropriate way.""What a disgusting woman showing her navel"". So cultural difference also plays an important part here. Muslim men keep their beard long and Indian start judging them for the basis of his beard. 

Prophet Muhammad said, ""your heaven lies in your mother feet"". Once a man asked whom we loved more in this world after Allah and prophet. The prophet said
Your mother
He asked then,
your mother,
He asked and then,
Your mother.
He asked again,
Your father,
So according to islam 75% love of children goes to mother and 25% to father.
Gold silver bronze goes to mother and father have to satisfy with just naming price.
If a man treated his wife as a sex object then he will be asked a question on the day of judgement. Men should treat their women as a princess if he does not that his fault he is just name sake Muslim. Look at the scripture nowhere god says you should treat your wife as a sex object.
The time when a girl child is born,it is a duty of her father to look after,when she marries,it is the duty of her husband to look after,if the husband dies it's her son/daughter to look after her.

Everyone will go to her according to his/her deeds
When I was in school, my teacher used to say 60% student in this class will going fail in the exam and most of them are from girls,girls why don't you study hard and pass the exam.

Here Muslim women are free to work if they want but under the condition of modesty. Men are not allowed to beat their wives. Not at all not at all. Yes I am also aware wife are afraid of her husband, but it her husband fault, then the husband needs to read the Quran to how to treat a wife
Wearing bikini, sex with boyfriend, drinking alcohol, eating pork that all prohibited in islam and that not a women empowerment in islam.
Women participated in sports, driving, work study ,join politics etc  that all a women empowerment in islam.

1472,dy8o41s,"It's quite ironic that they are celebrating the hijab. The hijab is a symbol of the position in society Muslim women are in. It shows that in some countries, they must wear this piece of clothing or will face severe consequences. Not sure what they're trying to celebrate about that. "
1473,dyaiz6i,"Speaking from experience, most Muslim women are forced to wear a hijab. Even if they claim it's a choice, it really isn't for most. They know that if they take it off they have to deal with the social repercussions."
1474,dysx1j3,"the hijab doesn't represent cleanliness and purity. 'modesty' is the more used term, whereas the former words imply that there's something dirty with non-hijabi muslim/non-muslim women. some more conservative muslims may definitely attach those purity symbols to the garb through a madonna/whore complex, and there may be societal assumptions - for instance, in middle eastern states or the gulf arab states where i live - where a hijab-covered woman is a respectable, religious woman hailing from a good, well-mannered family, but these are also known to be easily disproved generalizations, particularly when the hijab is common among family members, coworkers, friends, strangers, people at the grocery store, without all these magical qualities of ethereal grace.

you may be talking about the head-to-toe (but not face-covering) robes muslim women wear during prayer, which is different from the social attires of the hijab because those robes are worn only in prayer times, but even then, its acceptable to wear simple long-sleeved shirts and jeans or long skirts, if, for example, you're a muslim woman dressed for an outing but hear the call to prayer, so you want to make a stop at the nearest mosque or manage to locate a little prayer room in the building. but yeah, muslim women are urged to cover their hair, arms and legs only during prayers. its believed that you should be decently dressed if you're to humble yourself in prayer before god.

i'm not super religious or anything, but i am a muslim woman, so i hope this helps."
1475,dyuyuxl,"&gt;If a hijab does't have any message, and is indeed regarded as just any other piece of clothing, than what is the controversial about putting it off for eight hours a day? If people don't make a fuss about putting off their hat or cap at work or in school, than why make a fuss about a headscarve, if it's just the same. In fact, many hijab wearing women think this way and put off their scarf at work, even if it isn't required by the employer.

You admit that the message that the piece of clothing conveys is so ambiguous that it doesn't matter. Then why force women to not wear them? Why have the state meddle at all, if it indeed doesn't matter? (Or even if it does matter, but the UDHR is [controversial](https://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/8hvm4e/allochtonen_blijven_het_moeilijk_hebben_met/dymyqrd/) on this sub so I won't call upon it.) There isn't any more or any less reason to ban a hat or a cap or any piece of clothing than there is to ban a hijab. And yes, caps and hats are banned in many schools. One could wonder why.  
I hope you realize that the ""it's just a piece of clothing so why object to being forced"" can be used to justify **forcing** women to wear a hijab. ""Well, it's just a piece of clothing. I don't understand why women object to to having to wear a hijab.""  
IMHO the state using its significant means to force women to adhere to a dress code is a huge problem.  
  
  
As for why some women choose what they do or do not want to wear... Why do we care *why* certain women will avoid companies that [""suggest"" wearing high heels](https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20160512_02285571), even if that means these women will have less access to said jobs? Why is that our business? Why do we even have to consider all the possible motives, which we deem valid and which we don't if at the end of the day the only sure way to know is to ask various individuals why they do what they do?  
The answer is that it shouldn't matter what people's motives are in cases of ambigiuty. What matters is that there is no advantage to the state telling women what to wear.

&gt;There's a huge in between group who're pressured into covering up but are still allowed to work by their husbands.

I never, ever suggested otherwise. The ""not allowed to work""-example was to illustrate that a hijab isn't the only way to oppress women and that it makes no sense to, one by one, ban every possible means of oppression rather than tackling the oppression itself. It's not uncommon that non-muslim women are prohibited from working by their husband. The solution to this isn't to force women to go out of the house or to force them to get a job. That would just be tackling the symbol/means of the oppression.  
  
The solution is to tackle the oppression itself.  

&gt;This really is your favourite argument, isn't it?

Don't generalize, it doesn't serve a purpose.

&gt;And much of the things you listed at the end are things that leftwing parties want to do, so imo they have enough credit to stay true to secularism imo.

Your view on what secularism means is arbitrarily limited. Western countries in which civil servants are allowed to wear a dastaar at work aren't any more and any less secular than Belgium. There are various valid ways to deal with secularism. I think the passive-assertive secularism spectrum is a useful tool in this.  
The state telling people what to wear can indeed break the separation between church and state, which was also instituted to protect religion from the influence of the state. Not just the other way around. That doesn't seem very secular to me...  But I promised not to call upon the UDHR.   
And the neutrality argument makes little sense. Since we don't know (and hopefully don't care) why someone wears something we also don't know what they're trying to convey, if anything. Not only that, but there's no relationship between what they're wearing and what they do within the context of their job. The color T-shirt of a civil servant doesn't alter their actions and thus their neutrality. The standard reply is ""But people might think that someone wearing a rainbow shirt might prioritize helping LGBTQ+ people over other people."" Sure, and people might also think that female civil servants will favor women (or that they're less capable). Or that older civil servants will be more inclined to help older civil servants, at the expense of younger clients. People will imagine a whole slew of different things. But not the state nor the civil servants themselves can be held responsible for all the various things clients might imagine. Nor can the state or the civil servant possibly account for all of them. Besides, people who imagine these things are genuinely being obtuse. They should know how our institutions work and that the service they get is designed to be neutral, no matter whether or not a women is helping them at that particular moment.  
There isn't any indication that women who wear a hijab are less neutral. Antwerp's civil servants are allowed to wear a hijab when they work in back office, although they do have contact with clients through mail and telephone. So far I haven't heard of any indication of problems, although I might be mistaken in this.  
The best way to deal with threats to neutrality is to establish a service allowing both members of the public to make complaints. Whistle blowers should be protected. This way threats to neutrality and other issues could be snuffed out. Even when the client didn't actually have front-office contact with a civil servant but after any contact. If it is indeed true that civil servants wearing a hijab aren't neutral then this will become apparent quickly.  
As a former-ish civil servant I take these kinds of things very seriously.  
     
I realize that the right with its infinite obsession over identity issues often glosses over proposals to make an actual tangible difference in the lives of oppressed women and in stead chooses to focus on very selectively tackling symbols. But IMHO banning hijabs in any context won't mean any positive difference in the lives of these women. The measures I listed would actually mean a difference. To me that's not an afterthought in this discussion."
1476,dyyjoqk,"That “garbage bag” is called a niqab who actually, aren’t supposed to wear. Just like nuns in Christianity, Muslim women are supposed to wear a head scarf called a hijab and wear long sleeves and long pants. Your information is wrong, try again "
1477,dyzey9k,I find that insulting. You think Muslim women are choosing not to wear the hijab simply because of fashion/looking hot and sexy? 
1478,dz28m2g,"I lived in Morocco for 9 months and Lebanon for a month...also spent time in Egypt, Jordan, and Dubai. I would much rather be a woman in America than in pretty much any Muslim country. At the same time, some of the most independent and strong women I met are Muslim. I know strong women who chose the hijab and strong women who chose no hijab. It is true that many women are culturally pushed into their choices, and I don't doubt that there are many, many women who would prefer not to wear the hijab or niqab, but do so to avoid negative consequences, but you can't know that just by looking at them. If you judge them for their clothing, you are being ignorant and outright denying what free agency they might have. If you know, on the other hand, that they are beaten and held captive and are not choosing their clothing, then of course you are right to disapprove. My point is that not all Muslim women are covering their body in shame and oppression. For many or most of them it is for modesty and self respect. "

In the rural areas, there would be musical programmes, but due to islam, these programmes have reduced to the least. We used to celebrate our new year few years back(not the English one), but due to this religion, a lot of people have stopped participating in these kind of programmes.

That's how this religion is slowly destroying our culture, as it destroyed many cultures, including my neighbour countries. So yes, this has a lot of things to do with islam, not the culture."
1482,dwe0f8w,"This is quite reasonable, and a good thing, honestly. Notice, they're not proposing banning the hijab. So Muslim women are still completely free to cover their hair if they wish to. However, now, nobody is completely shut off and basically masked from everyone, especially their teachers. It's hard to read students and classmates effectively and give them an appropriate classroom environment when you can't see their face."
1483,dwjv5r5,"Far from baseless. Fundamentalist Islam is violent and inherently misogynistic, homophobic, and anti-Semitic. Muslim women are correspondingly statistically more likely to experience domestic violence. Islamic countries are generally and literally shitholes and even when developed (eg: Saudi Arabia) violate basic principal human rights.

The burqa and hijab are both some of the most public and disgusting examples of that stated above.

That said, the core tenants of Islam and other religions such as Christianity have merit but they need not be tied to outdated ""laws"" and theology. "
1484,dwuap9b,"What a stupid comparison. Even though a lot of middle Eastern and Muslim women are coerced to use the hijab a part of them also use them willingly. 
Islam might be quite backwards in various ways but it's principles don't got against human rights or advocate for ethnic cleansing. 

Measures like this is pure identity politics by the nativist right. I wonder if now nuns will be forced to drop using their habit. "

Even if hijab isn't implimented by law, not wearing one can mean you are met with huge social punishments in your community if you dont wear one.

Im of the veiw that if something exists it will show itself and everyone will see. If muslim women were really happy and free all over the world people will see that and recognise that. Its hard for me to explain i wear my hijab out of choice and defend myself when millions of muslim women are being oppressed all over the world and treated as less than human. Just in a previous thread a woman was talkinf about imams encouraging her friend to stay with her abusive husband, incidents like this are very common. Have you read/watched handmaids tale. Very eyeopening, sadly what we see depicted there is reality for many muslim women all over the world. Instead of defending ourselves we should show our goodness as a community by being commited to change for the better.....that being said many of these anti hijab people dont actually care about women. Sadly, society is obssesed with trying to control women and deny us our agency and bodily autonomy. Being muslim you get it from both sides from muslims and non Muslims alike."
1490,dvw5e5l,"Because a nun, by wearing the habit, is married to *God.*  They aren't supposed to be having sex with anybody, because they are *His* wife.  They also wear the habit when they're alone, and with other nuns, which I think is different than what happens in all but the most fundamental of Islamic sects.  Islamic women are still married to mortal men, still expected to perform earthly duties.  It's a glaring inconsistency; why would *God* punish your immodesty (not wearing the hijab/burqa) but decree that you have sex with your husband whenever he demands it, in whatever way he demands it?  Why doesn't the modesty also extend to men (which it does, they are not supposed to lust after women, they ""solved"" this by making women cover up)?"
1491,duu75nd,"I shall try to answer you concerning the POV you are coming from. Insha'Allah the answer will be satisfactory.

&gt; I personally do not understand the purpose and benefits of the hijab,

Hijab is the concealment of the body of the woman. You mention you are American. The USA is known to be a hyper-sexualized society. From selling lingerie to selling burgers or spare-parts for vehicles, using attractive women to draw in customers is common. You may also think that this advertising is for ""men"", but ask yourself why adverts for makeup products feature thin, skinny European women with flawless skin and lush hair?

Now when a woman puts on clothing that conceals her physical appearance, can a man or other women judge her by that? They are forced to look beyond how you appear, which is why they struggle to grasp it initially.

I have come across articles on Western media outlets that discuss topics like ""impossible standards of beauty"" and it mentions how young female women are driven to extremes to meet these standards (or take their own lives sometimes).

Can you now (somewhat) see the wisdom behind hijab?

&gt; As an American who reads a lot about feminism

You must be careful about buying into the agenda of the kufaar my sister. If you want to follow the ideals of great women, look to Islam. The Sahaabiyah (RA) are great examples to emulate.

Although these feminists bring up the same concerns about not being treated like sexual objects, they create their own theories concerning how to address these issues. Some of their extremes include ""free the nipple"". 

We already have our answers and they will stand the test of time.

&gt; but feel like it's a bit unfair

Many pious Ulama have given lengthy explanations about how men and women differ in many aspects. The conclusion they always reach is that Muslim women are given rights that no non-Muslim are yet to have until these modern times.

You shouldn't see it as a one-to-one comparison, but evaluate the situation entirely.

-----

As far as the rulings go (your other questions), my advice on this sub will always be that you should seek an answer from a pious scholar.

Instead, I will make a duaa for you (and all other striving sisters in such difficult times):

Aameen."

Let me ask you a genuine question, do you have hijabi friends? Have you engaged with one in how they actually feel let alone their insights. Look man, the hijab is not about putting women in a mandatory uniform like you are saying. Muslim women are not a monolith and each and every one observing the hijab has their own personal reasons and it can be empowering. My friend says that it helps people especially men see her for who she is on the inside, that the hijab is a mark of her worship doing something strictly for God to manifest the many ways she is in awe for everything He has done for her. She also has a wonderful self esteem and manages to make my days brighter so I don't get it when you say that it will negatively impede how you value and view yourself.

Very slight anxiety. I did worry if she'd say ""Tie me up and fuck me?? Are you an insane husband or what??""

But after explaining and showing pictures to her, she agreed to try it out and ended up loving it. We've since never had vanilla sex, never at all.

&gt; Do you think it's harder in your culture to fulfill sexual desires?

I honestly doubt so. Let me share with you the most common fetish among Muslim males in my country. It's to fuck a woman who is entirely naked BUT wearing a hijab. 

&gt; Or at least to find someone else willing to admit they want them too?

This is hard to answer. But since Muslim women are generally (not all) very obedient to their husbands, and disobeying the husbands' requests would be rewarded with a place in hell (try not to laugh), they generally consent to sexual ideas as long as it doesn't hurt them"

Do you worry at all that with this obedience there could be things Muslim wives would feel forced to pretend to like? I guess more specifically, does it ever make you second guess or check if your wife enjoys everything as much as she seems to, seeing as it's a cultural norm to be obedient? 

The reason I ask is I sometimes have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that my girlfriend enjoys anal as much as I do when the common joke or taboo is that it's always painful and terrible for the girl so I find myself checking in with her a little too often. "

Once off I noticed I got a lot more attention, wanted and unwanted kinds. I realised I didnt like this added level of exposure. I walked in to a world where my hair, body, ass were public property. I hated it. It took me a few months to decide to go back to hijab and modesty and people were not happy. 

For some reason, it is those people who go round telling me that oppression had me put it back on, my family would disown me (lol wut?).

For sure some are required and some are forced but others choose to wear them.

Besides, anyone looking for empowerment should supported and guided, not shunned as it's that empowerment that degrades problematic systems IMO.

And if you're just now getting a red head because the nature of the Hijab in the Qur'an is oppressive: at its core probably yeah. But religions evolve. Muslim women are not bound to seeing the headscarf only in the most archaic ways of interpreting their religious texts and allowing Muslim women to find their own way of dealing with the controversy without judgment from the outside may very well be a good step to help reform the Islam from within. Muslim women aren't even allowed to enter a Mosque while menstruating. It's time they are shown the respect that they can read their own religious text and decide for themselves whether they want to wear the Hijab and what it means for them. "
1512,dtkhh7w,"&gt; Are you seriously advocating for the oppression of women on the sole basis that the 'white man' opposes said oppression?

This assumes that all Muslim women are forced to wear Hijab, this is simply not the case.

Do you not think telling a woman she is not allowed to wear something is just as oppressive as telling her she must wear something. Or is patriarchy ok, as long as its coming from you?

Some Muslim women find that wearing the hijab allows them better social mobility as some men in a Muslim society will give them more respect.

The problem I see is when Muslim women are not free to make that choice for themselves but instead have this religious garment forced upon them. As we surely must stand with the freedom to wear religious garments, we must also stand with the freedom to not wear such clothing."

I think the general support for the theocratic regime and its trimmings has a lot to do with the view of the previous regime as corrupt. Many people equate ""religious"" with ""moral"". The belief is if people are good Muslims (or Christians, Buddhists, Jains or whatever else), then society will be better, safer, more moral.

So then the hijab becomes part of this same view. Good Muslim women are moral people, and they show they are good Muslims by this outward expression, and the logic is turned back in on itself so that wearing the hijab is for the good of society.

People are idiots despite their good intentions."
1517,dtubaek,"Yes, but this really is a fucking terrible symbol for it. We should fight oppression but attacking the hijab is not a good way to do it. 

Countries where it's a forced law are few and far between. If [this map is accurate](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-db098384ddfe7ee92241a8fe81c89ef8) there are actually more countries that prevent you from wearing it than make you wear it. 

The simple fact is that in almost every country on the planet, it's a choice. When you can choose whether to do something or not, that is literally the opposite of oppression.

Edit: Judging by downvotes, people seem to be pissed that I brought fact and truth to this discussion. It's not my fault that the world isn't how you imagine it to be.

Edit 2: Removed the apology for giving people facts and also, found more! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab_by_country

&gt;Muslim women are legally required to wear hijab in public in Saudi Arabia [1] and the Indonesian Aceh province,[2] and all women are required to do so in Iran.

2 countries and a single province require it. I guess if someone wants to prove my sources wrong instead of simply downvoting the truth, they can. 

Or they can just perpetuate ignorance so we can further restrict the choice of women by targetting a piece of clothing they choose to wear, rather than tackle the actual oppression that happens in the world. You know, treat the disease rather than imagined symptoms? 

Prove me wrong. Go on, I'm waiting."
1518,dtvprje,"because women, especially muslim women, are so helpless that they cannot choose to wear hijab. amirite"
1519,dtzqdz7,"I’m with the American feminist on this one. At least she acknowledged that Islam does oppress women and that there are Islamic countries like Iran where it is a clear symbol of oppression since women are standing up against it. In the West, it’s not a symbol of oppression since many women find it a symbol of their connection to God (even though, yes, many are still forced to take it and they should have voices too) However, in the West contrary to in Eastern cultures, hijab is rejected and Muslim women are disproportionately targeted when it comes to islamaphobic sentiments taken out on someone.

The news anchor is pretty disrespectful and doesn’t have many good point like... comparing hijab (in the west) to FGM and Chinese foot binding? Cmon bro .. Those things do permanent damage to your body and affect your life in every step (literally) whereas hijab is something you can liberate yourself from if you want in the west. 
He’s right that there should be more done in Islamic cultures to prevent women from being forced to wear hijab but that isn’t the American feminist’s job. Like she said her job is to care about reproductive rights in America and how Muslim women in America feel rather than fight a world wide cause."
1520,du31c3j,"Do you know about the mandatory hijab in Iran? Muslims definitely care about what other muslims are doing. More pointedly, what muslim women are doing. I'm athiest myself, but I really like wearing my shorts and wouldn't want to give it up.

Before you accuse me of racism, know that I am Indian."
1521,du8r85c,"Isn’t it funny how feminists are always talking about things like coercion, exploitation, power imbalances, social conditioning, objectification, etc,  when talking about behaviors/expectations related to Western women...

But when it comes to Muslim women wearing the hijab, burqa and Niqab, none of those things get mentioned and they all pretend wearing those items is completely voluntary. 

They don’t talk about how Muslim women are pressured and conditioned from childhood by their families, churches and communities to wear those. (Social conditioning, gender norms)

The don’t talk about how Muslim women are required to wear those so the men aren’t tempted by the flesh and don’t rape or assault them . (Sexual Objectification, victim blaming)

They don’t talk about how many Muslim women in conservative households are often shamed and ostracized by their families if they refuse to wear them. They don’t talk about how Muslim women in majority Islamic countries are often attacked, beaten and imprisoned if they go out in public without them. 

They don’t talk about the internalized misogyny and backwards views many Muslim women have towards the female gender from being raised in regressive, backwards cultures/communities. 

All of those things are irrelevant, huh? There aren’t any outside factors or expectations that influence Muslim women’s “choice” to wear the burqa, hijab, and niqab. They don’t have to worry about any negative consequences or repercussions when deciding whether or not to wear those items.... It’s completely optional and their *choice* to wear them is definitely a matter of empowerment! 

You guys are fucking hypocrites... It really feels like modern lib feminists are more concerned with virtue signaling and appearing to be “tolerant” rather than fighting for women’s rights and actually speaking out against the oppression women face in other cultures. They are willing to betray their own liberal, secular values for the sake of political correctness and the appearance of tolerance. 

EDIT: You know... after thinking about this more, I think you can actually draw some parallels between this issue and the MeToo movement regarding the sexual exploitation of women in Hollywood. 

Most of those cases involve women who **chose** to go along with whatever sexual acts those wealthy powerful men wanted to do to them... but most people agree that they didn’t truly have a choice in the matter. 

Feminists argue that those women were exploited and forced to go along with it because they were **afraid of the repercussions** that would happen if they didn’t. There were major **power imbalances** because these men had a lot of power and influence over their careers. These women *feared* that if they refused to go along with it, they would lose their jobs and get blacklisted... in other words, they would be **ostracized and kicked out of their community.** In some of these case, the women even **feared physical violence and harm**. Other women felt **“conditioned”** to go along with it because this was “part of Hollywood **culture”. **

That’s an interesting thing to consider, isn’t it? "
1522,du9s27f,"I mean..she may be right. We may clearly need to take some lessons from Islam here. Maybe that's what we've been missing.

EDIT: Posted on recommendation:
&gt;As American women, many of us have an idea of what feminists are; freelancing women with all the sexual freedom in the world. But this is exactly the problem with American feminism; it is all about sex and the liberation of our bodies. Certainly, things like abortion and contraception is a part of that freedom, but in today’s society the fight has taken on a much different tone.

&gt;Hip Feminist campaigns like Free the Nipple only encourage a gullible behavior of disrespect for our own bodies, leading to everyone else around us disrespecting our bodies as well. If we want to be respected as women and taken seriously in all our endeavors we should look to a new source; Muslim women. Muslim women, as well as Muslim men, see every body as a sacred temple, especially the female body. Opposed to exposing themselves, it is through modesty. When we think of modern feminists we should stray away from the new American trends and start looking to what we have always thought as a contradiction; Muslim feminists.

&gt;Contrary to American popular belief, Islam has a culture and history of women empowerment. In the Qur’an, which is believed to be God’s word told to Prophet Muhammad, women and men are described as equals in everyday actions and responsibilities. When it comes to family, charity, children, sex, and much more, a man and a woman have the same duties and that is to continue on the straight path.

&gt;Early Islamic women kept this idea alive. The first Muslim woman was Khadija, Mohammed’s first wife. Without her influence, Islam might not have emerged as successfully as it did. Khadija was a business woman and a land owner in the lands of Arabia. When Mohammed was given revelations, it was Khadija that ensured him that he was not going insane, but that he was a chosen one. It was Khadija that pushed Mohammed to listen to God and the angels that were trying to communicate with him and to not run in fear. It was Khadija that gave Muhammad the support and confidence in his development as becoming God’s last prophet. Khadija, a woman, was the strength that allowed Islam to fully bloom. Just this one example gives us a view on how true Muslim women are; outspoken, driven, certain and courageous, the epitome of a feminist.

&gt;So it’s no surprise to see Muslim woman today modeling themselves after these prominent female figures. Muslim girls look towards these instances of strength for guidance in this scary, patriarchal society. These modern women are not afraid to go against the grain in the name of their belief like wearing the hijab to covey their religious devotion. Hijab is the headscarf that is worn by Muslim woman and no; it is not supposed to be forced on them by their fathers and husbands. Wearing or not wearing the Hijab reflects a Muslim woman’s own a personal choice.

&gt;For me, this idea especially showcases feminism in America. With all of the pressures in our American society to have a certain physical allure; to have long, luscious hair, a skinny yet curvy body, flawless facial beauty, woman go through hell. With this, we succumb to the pressures that we generally think we are free of; we oppress our natural womanhood with constant worry about how we look to others around us. We do not have the courage to stand up to this societal critique and say ‘my body is not to be ogled at’.

&gt;For many Muslim women however, they strive to achieve just that. In this way, they liberate themselves from these everyday pressures. They actually have the courage to say hey, I am not an object of pleasure, I am a woman that commands only respect for who I am and not how I look. They have the power to self-liberate as well as the courage to diverge from the American norms. And they do not get attention from showing off their figure, but they get attention by how they present themselves. Muslim woman get respect and are looked at beyond aesthetics; they are actually taken seriously in their communities.

&gt;Isn’t this what feminism should be? Don’t women deserve consistent respect and to actually be listened to without drools or criticisms over our bodies and looks? I believe the answer is yes. In the Muslim-American community, and even in parts of the greater Muslim world, modest woman, whether they wear hijab or not, are respected and called upon, despite what our mainstream media feeds to us.

&gt;A few weeks ago I went to a lecture about feminism- in Islam. That is what got all these thoughts stirring in my head once again. The lecturer was a Muslim woman in hijab; she spoke so passionately that every person in the room, guy and girl, had no choice but to immerse themselves in her words. After a quick hour and a half, I could not help but think about all our Free the Nipple group representing a trendy feminism and how some trends need to die. I realized we have been conditioned to think that American women are the free and that Muslim women are the suppressed, but this is twisted to me. I finally understood who is really oppressed by a patriarchal society and it is us. Woman who wear hijab have freed themselves from a man’s and a society’s judgmental gaze; the Free the Nipplers have not. They have fallen deep into the man’s world, believing that this trend will garner respect.

&gt;So I urge my Free the Nipple gal pals to take a look at your Muslim sisters and collaborate with them to create a feminism that treats the female body as a temple and not as a toy. Let us see feminism in a different light—through modesty and the courage to savor our sugar. Let us call on the Muslim feminists of the world.

"
1523,duclc06,"She just legit confirmed what i just said , she went on different articles talking about how some women are forced to wear hijab without actually looking at the picture from both sides. New's flash, there will always be those people who will force their religion on others. Don't use that as an excuse to make it seem like all muslim women are forced to wear hijab. The vast majority are very happy with their culture. My sister for example started wearing hijab when she was 16 and no one forced her. If only, my mother actually told her that it's a huge commitment (My mom does not wear hijab). I don't know here you are from but you should really look at what Feminism is doing to some countries at the moment. Did you know that Middle-eastern women are the most sought after women in the world? or how western women are actually becoming unhappier due to feminism. And how Middle-eastern women and women from a fairly conservatice countries are much happier than their western counterpart?. There are countries like Saudi Arabia who actually do need feminism but a lot of muslim countries don't need that shit.
Edit: There are some muslim countries who are suffering from all kinds of issues due to ignorance and poverty. Both men and women are suffering so a person like would would not understand how hard it is unless you live it."
1524,duggftl,"It's odd OP says that since in Islam we're under no obligation to have children, or have sex only for procreation. More so, the issues she has are due to conservative culture, not per se religion. If it wasn't hijab, it'd be about cutting her hair (sikh) or wearing pants (Christian). Her story isn't unique. More so, Muslim women are under no obligation to live at home. Many live alone or with roommates for education and careers. One of the main roles of the Muslim student groups is finding a roommate... 


Her family sucks, but she's an adult. She's not a teen nor is she in Saudi. She can simply not return. Like I and many other women have done. I also find it severely insulting to be told wearing hijab is forced on nearly all women. That isn't the case, at all. Unless do we say wearing a shirt in public is forced on all men and women? I wore hijab for 4 years. Out of the 100s of Muslim women I meant, none were forced. This is US and Canada FFS, not Iran. "
1525,druksmh,"Freedom is for you. When you curb someone else's freedom then it is no longer freedom and the system steps in to prevent that. 

In this case, muslim women are subjugated and brainwashed to believe that wearing an all black abaya or a hijab in 100F weather is their freedom. No it is not. It is stupid and oppressive and the systems job is to step in and kick these stupid 16th century beliefs out even if it means you need to send back those who believe in that nonsense back to the middle east. 


"
1526,druusz3,"Normally yes, but from my experience most exMuslims sensationalize hijab.. I mean look at your post:

&gt; It makes me feel like their husband should be walking them around on a leash.

I find this to be the general sentiment shared by exMuslim, at least on this sub. It's a bit silly to most practicing Muslims and the whole 'Muslim women are victims' mentality is too common."
1527,drv5pup,"Uncovered as in not wearing niqab+burqa, not stripping in the streets of Aleppo, Einstein.

Everywhere in the world, including Muslim majority countries like Kuwait, Turkey, Azerbaijan and my home Malaysia, women have the choice to wear the hijab or be free-hair. 

(Well, the Southern bits and East Malaysia are cool with free-hair, but in the conservative Northeast Muslim women are required to wear hijab or face fines.) 

That's what is meant by uncovered, genius. Non-hijabi. If you know nothing of the topic, why try to but in with your preconceived Yank notions? Typical American."
1528,drxqzwx,"Would it occur to you that the former muslim women who speak against the hijab are most likely to be particularly the women who were forced by their families? 


Everyone in my family is a practicing muslim living in Canada. At the time,  only some of my aunts wore the hijab regularly and no one told me to, and yet when I was in the first grade I decided to because I knew hijabs had something to do with maturity and piety. By 7th grade, when I was the most religious in my life (for reasons that had nothing to do with the people around me) I wanted to wear the burka. I wouldn't want to assume the experience of most muslim women are the same as mine but based on my own I can say that anyone who tries to claim no woman would genuinely want to wear the hijab is wrong.

I treat the hijab in the same respect of any modest clothing. Maybe there are tons of women who  dress modestly because they're pressured to, but I would never accuse any woman who dresses modestly of that, nor would I say modest clothing is symbolically sexist"
1529,drxzdux,"&gt;Son, I never actually said those words but you claimed I did multiple times

again i'm trying to point out the nuance of you adding a qualifier to an entirely irrelevant subject.  

&gt;s, and yet you weren't lying?

you sure u weren't?  

&gt; Son, do we have to go over this again? Y

yes father, we can go over it as many times as it'll take to get through to your head..
&gt;You can't just make stuff up.

doesn't seem to stop you.  

&gt; Muslim women do face discrimination in the west. 

lots of people face discrimination in the west.  
difference is that this isn't institutionalized like with women in middle east. 
(well obvi blacks, &amp; native americans)  

&gt; You originally said they don't by 0% of the population, but have since admitted that was false.

congratulations, you caught me on a big lie.  

&gt;. I do not believe it's okay that some Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab, you keep on claiming I do but i do not. 

as i said, it's all about that little thing called subtletly and nuance.  
context.  
you added an irrelevant bullshit obfuscator in order to do what exactly?  

&gt;. Again, you cannot jsut make stuff up and pretend it's okay. You are not Donald Trump.

are you?  

&gt;I was mocking the ridiculoussness of your argument

&gt;About as much sense as believing Muslim women face diacmination in the west is the same thing as believing Muslim women should be forced to wear the hijab

the irony.





"
1530,dsb9lzt,"I'm a Muslim woman (I don't wear a hijab every day, only when I go to the mosque) and I think that if it is the woman who chooses to wear it, totally cool. I'm not down with forced hijab at all (and a lot of Muslim women are not either)"
1531,dsr5ys1,"I think you'd be surprised in Western Muslim communities (in US/Canada/UK). Most women I've met who wear hijabs have a pretty (to me at least) bizarrely proud and ""feminist"" explanation for wearing them. A few Muslim women I know who do not wear the hijab do mention that their parents made them when they were teenagers, but it's also a thing for Muslims girls whose parents didn't force them decide to wear the hijab because it's a pretty obvious fashion statement and ""in-group"" marker at school/university if there are other girls who wear the hijab.

All in all, in the US/Canada/UK where there is no sharia law enforcing this, being a concern troll on the hijab is a pretty big sign you've never actually talked with or been around a Muslim community, and you have trouble grasping that the boogeyman negatives that you associate with their culture do not consume everything they do. This politically correct shit where everything is oppression is pretty tired stuff. Muslim women are not oppressed by the hijab, just as Sikh men are not oppressed by the turban covering their hair."
1532,dsvlh33,"You're all over the place. This thread is about a London school not Muslim countries or the rest of the world. 

You also said 'Muslim women are brainwashed from their birth to wear hijabs'. Now you are going back on that statement and contradicting yourself. 

I never denied some Muslim girls are forced to wear the hijab or burka. On the other hand, you said all Muslim women are essentially forced to wear the hijab, which is evidently bullshit of the highest degree, and then you went on to track back. 

Stop talking about things you have no idea about, and stop making sweeping statements like that in the future, ok?"
1533,dswdqx2,"I think it's mainly because in the modern age beards aren't as common. Nowhere in the Quran does it actually say that beards are a requirement, but in most Muslim-majority countries it's the norm. It doesn't say in the Quran that Muslim women are forced to wear Hijab either, but a lot of them do as a show of their religion. "
1534,dt0ofdp,"You raise a fair point. However, there's a huge difference that you're overlooking. 

Wearing the hijab in the US, while not a cultural norm here, does not carry any kinds of serious consequences. I would even argue against your point that it's socially unacceptable to wear hijab in the US. In any area of the US with a Muslim population you will see women wearing the hijab. It would be a totally normal sight in many parts of the US. Maybe you'd get some weird looks in more rural areas, but that's about it. Muslim women are even afforded legal protection to wear hijab under our first amendment rights. 

While in Iran, women are required to wear the hijab while in public. You would face consequences both legally and socially if you refused to wear it. There's a big difference between the situation in Iran, versus the US. In Iran you'll be arrested for not wearing hijab. Put on the hijab in the US and the worst that will happen is someone gives you a funny look on the bus. 

By putting on a hijab as a protest in the US, you're protesting against a problem that doesn't really exist. "
1535,dt2bbvt,"&gt; its the belief that Muslim women are forced to do those things, regardless if they want to or not.

Yeah, that's fairly accurate. Events such as this one does not help with public perspective.

See http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5258047/Man-slaps-Muslim-woman-not-wearing-hijab-Malaysia.html"
1536,dptfarf,Nobody is claiming Islamic men are feminists. The claim was the hijab is an expression of feminism
1537,dptfeja,"
&gt;Islamic men are not feminist, the hijab is not feminist. 

And I never claimed that it was. I said that having the free choice to wear one if you want is. "
1538,dqgckm0,"To an extent they are being forced through religious pressure. Muslim women are often significantly pressured to wear a Hijab, just like other religions impose restrictions on its members. Women are the ones usually being oppressed in these circumstances.

I don't think banning is the answer, but neither is celebrating it as a choice when it is not."
1539,dql9v9e,"&gt; then banning police would also ban individuals from the police.

You're missing a key word from this sentence: ""then banning *the* police would also ban individuals from the police."" 

This also isn't true at all. You can't ban private individuals from public events on the basis of where they work. I mean, you could try but good luck enforcing that. How would you know?

You can, however, ban ""the police"". This means banning all visible representations of the police: uniforms, cars, banners, signs, et cetera. You can ban ""the police"" as an abstract *idea* by banning the things that clearly and visibly represent that idea (i.e. visible symbols and vulgar messaging).

&gt; If Vancouver Pride said, ""no, we aren't banning Muslim women, we are just banning hijabs,"" then this would be functionally identical to a ban on Muslim women...

You would have to assume that *all * Muslim women wear hijabs for this to work, however. You can ban the hijab without banning Muslim women. Muslim women are not, in Canada, required to wear the hijab in order to belong to Islam. Their beliefs do not center around the wearing of the hijab. The hijab is a garment that has clear cultural (and therefore religious) associations, yes. Because this garment and the religion that it's associated with are so closely linked, banning the hijab wouldn't be functionally identical to banning Muslim women, it'd be functionally identical to banning *Islam* (even though men don't wear the hijab).

&gt; Keep in mind that no one anywhere is saying that the police as an institution aren't banned from Pride.

Actually, that's *exactly* what people here are arguing. They are quite literally saying: 

&gt; But they aren't banned...

So, yes, that *is* what people are saying. 

&gt; The difference is that people who are police can still come; they just can't bring the institution with them.

I'm aware of that, and that's *exactly* what I'm arguing here. The police (as an institution) is banned, but *individuals* (who happen to be police officers) are not banned.

You are literally making my exact point.

&gt; No person in the world is banned from Pride by this decision.

Correct, and that's exactly what I've been saying this entire time. No *person* is banned by this decision. Only ""the police"" (as an institution) is."

I especially tell the women I know to ignore those fatawa and train hard, so they can fight hard if and when the time arises.
Muslim women are attacked more cause of the hijab they wear.

Even without these threats, the positive effects these kinda sports have on a person outweigh the negatives.

I don't believe fighting professionally is in line with Islamic teachings though.
But that is my personal opinion and I'm just sharing it cause we're kinda anonymous here.
It's not my place to judge a man simply cause he doesn't follow my opinion on this.

I don't deny the Hadith about striking the face but I believe it's high time scholars sat down and discussed these issues properly with actual experts and research.



"
1543,dqwy51f,"The difference is preference vs requirement.

The hijab itself isn't the issue, it's that when it is *required* for women to wear it, it's oppressive. If people like wearing them, go for it. I personally love baseball caps, but to require it by law is asanine. 

""The most visible form of hijab is the head covering that many Muslim women wear. Hijab however goes beyond the head scarf. In one popular school of Islamic thought, hijab refers to the complete covering of everything except the hands, face and feet in long, loose and non see-through garments. A woman who wears hijab is called Muhaajaba.

Muslim women are required to observe the hijab in front of any man they could theoretically marry.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/hijab_1.shtml

I don't know about y'all, but there is a line between fashion and requirements for dress. "
1544,dr5wwuk,"I think one of the reasons is many of us feel that sometimes Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab and similar garments, as opposed to out of their own free will and respect for God. Of course, this isn't really that true for Muslims living in the West where they're more free than, say, Saudi Arabia. But I would guess that's the main reason nonetheless - we associate the hijab with oppression rather than liberty. "
1545,drg69h2,"&gt; The purpose of wearing the hijab, whether by choice or by force, is to appear modest in the presence of unfamiliar men.

Yes.

&gt; A hijab is also worn so a man can focus on the personality of a female rather than her physical beauty. 

Ah, no. Muslim women are held to stricter beauty standards by their husbands than non-Muslim women. They're expected to wear lingerie, maintain their weight and appearance, and ""be demons in the sack"". Islam teaches these ""pleasing your husband"" is one of the most important duties for a wife. 

&gt; Why wear makeup then? The point of makeup is to increase physical attractiveness.

To be attractive for the husband, or if unmarried, potential husbands (within the constraints of hijab). 

"
1546,drgjed1,"When are people gonna stop drinking the Kool aid that says Muslim women are some how saints, feminists, and courages whole embracing a blatantly anti woman religion. Muslim is not a race, gender, or nationality, it’s a highly flawed and utterly bullshit religion. Stop hiding behind your hijab."
1547,dp2lxz4,"I don't mind it, I know this is circlebroke and they're fed up with redditors. I'm fed up with redditors as well, but in this case I kinda sided with most redditors and I'm not exactly proud of it, but just because reddit is Islamophobic doesn't mean that Islam isn't fucking shit to women.

However, thanks to the power of tradition, social convention and family, many Islamic women are -- in my opinion - brainwashed into wearing a niqab. Sure, they do so seemingly on their own accord, but a good litmus test of freedom is to see if they're allowed to wear revealing Western clothes. If they can't do that, then they're being coerced. If they can, then all the power to them for wearing a hijab. A hijab, not a niqab, hijab covers the hair but leaves the face open.

Also, Quaran doesn't actually say women should cover their faces, it was a form of historical suppression and social control of women and their freedom, so I'm not gonna shed a tear about how we're 'disrespecting their culture'. Culture ends where human rights begin. "
1548,doyfhfh,"For the most part they do make that choice themselves. 

There are also those that claim all women are forced to wear the hijab or face beatings. That is also not true. 


Likewise I can find a story whereby a muslim woman was attacked for wearing a hijab. What does that say about the situation, well not much as in both cases it is likely this is a very rare event, hence why it is news. 

Nonetheless it will be seized upon to further a narrative than muslim women are forced, rather than seen as a rare event that sadly occasionally happens.

1549,doyt13p,You're extremely delusional and downright ignorant if you don't think some Muslim women are forced to wear a hijab or niqab. 
1550,dp66zxr,"there are *plenty* of muslim women who dont wear the hijab yet are still deeply, deeply conservative. muslim women are hard to read."
1551,dpfgtv3,"As someone who is Muslim, I support the right for people to practise their religion as they feel is right for them as long as they don't infringe upon the rights of others. The hijab arguably has roots in Arab patriarchal culture rather than religion and it has become a determining factor in some people's eyes of a woman's ""religiousness"" and virtue. So while hijabs are unfairly discriminated against in non-Muslim societies, non-hijabed Muslim women are also unfairly discriminated against in Muslims societies and communities but only one of these issues are discussed. In many Muslim communities and societies, non-hijabed Muslim women are treated like social pariah or loose women just because they don't cover their hair. It would be nice for there to be more conversation about all of these issues that various Muslim women face. "
1552,dpny97t,But aren't there plenty of Muslims who don't wear the hijab? It just goes on to further normalise the idea that Muslim women are somehow less Muslim if they don't wear the hijab.
1553,dpukycq,"&gt; “Muslim women are obliged to wear the headscarves even if they work for international hotel chains; even as global entities, they (hotel operators) must be more rational.”


Hold up, I thought it’s optional?

How come now all of a sudden it’s a requirement and since when is hijab a measure of one’s religiousness?"
1554,dnnk6do,"it depends on the degree of oppression in the country. 

*The garment has different legal and cultural status in various countries. Muslim women are legally required to wear hijab in public in Saudi Arabia and the Indonesian Aceh province, and all women are required to do so in Iran.*

"
1555,dnpvaap,"&gt;I understand your view on hijab but that’s your opinion,not a fact

Is it truly that? Physically,the Hijab is just a piece of cloth that covers a woman’s head,but my “opinion” is not formed around that.

I’m talking about the **meaning** of Hijab,and that meaning is Clearly established on both sides:

- a Shield,a Tool of cloth that “protects the pious woman’s virtue from the gaze of men”

- a Cage,a Binding That makes women a degree lower than men,a property

**both sides use Quranic and Hadith evidence**

But in the end,The Hijab is a symbol of Islam,and we all know what Islam thinks of women,and adding up to the fact that Muslim women are abused/bullied by Islamic societies and their families into wearing the Hijab for reasons mentioned in the first meaning,and are abused even more if they resist,the second meaning becomes more feasible 

&gt; On a different note, how do Eid al adha and quranic schools affect other people? 

Eid al Adha is **Literally** slaughtering an Animal(Mainly sheep) the Halal way,which is literally cutting it throat open and letting them bleed to death

**it’s already banned**,one of the most brutal ways of killing an animal,done in public,it’s animal abuse *for god’s sake*

[And this is a Quranic School,if you’re not Disgusted about this....](https://youtu.be/wp3mvQMeJSg) 


&gt;And how is a separate store selling halal food a bad thing when everyone can go buy from it? 

It’s a waste of Resources,you can have a small section in the bigger supermarkets
For halal food,and since Halal food making involves animal abuse,only religious people need it,it doesn’t justify making a store for it unless it’s a Muslim majority country,where All Stores are Halal 


&gt;And why does public praying bother you so much? 

Unlike what you said,**it is for show**,designated areas for praying are alright,**Praying on the Sidewalk isn’t**

People who do this are trying to promote their religion,using prayer as an “excuse”


"
1556,dnq3f3v,Muslim women are free to take off their hijab/scarf when they are in company of only women so i guess they simply go to a female-hairdresser.
1557,dnrnvz5,"According to the vast majority of scholars, commentators, and jurists niqab is not obligatory, that the hands and face need not to be covered based on the linguistics and meaning of the specific words used in the Quran -""khimar"" and ""jilbab"" - and also because the Prophet pbuh never explicitly said faces need to be covered. But the woman that do wear it for the sake of Allah SWT do so because they believe it's a part of their awrah so they cover it to perfect their definition of hijab. Mabey some of them also believe it's obligatory because of two scholars by the name of Ubaida As-Salmani and Ibn Abbas ( ra)who when asked about the hijab they said that ""the Muslim women are ordered to cover their head and faces with outer garments except for one eye"" and Ibn Abbas (ra) circled his left eye with his fingers. 

I've only found this in my parents home country but there are some that wear it for reasons entirely non Islamic. In my home country a minority of women wear it because they were told that they are so beautiful and they wear it so they won't be hit with the evil eye hasad. And some wear it temporarily when they don't want to be recognized when running an errand outside of home. "
1558,dnt4k33,"It depends! I'm not saying that 100% of countries, communities, and families are reasonable. Some are shitty and will pressure/force others to follow their beliefs. 

And that's wrong and should be stopped and opposed. 

But to act like 100% of muslim women are forced to wear a hijab is blatantly unrealistic. "
1559,dntgpss,"&gt; If they're wearing a scarf for fashion reasons that's not hijab.

A hijab is a hijab lol. How can you redefine what's a hijab and what's not simply by the purpose of them wearing it? That doesn't make any sense. 

And again you're ignoring all these women who wear the hijab for non-sexist reasons. And it doesn't change the fact that these Muslim women are able to take them off with no problem nor consequences. 

Anyway, if we can't come to a consensus, then we should agree to disagree then. "
1560,dnyreux,"These westernized Arab faces with western make up and eyebrows inside a hijab or a burka are pure globalist propaganda and a great example of Islamic taaqiya (holy deception). *This is not real. This is not how it works.* Muslim women are not actually allowed to wear make up like this, they are not allowed to accentuate their beauty or highlight their sexuality in public. This is just visual branding to try to trick dumb feminists into thinking Islam is their pathway to freedom and equality. It is a big lie. DuckDuckGo ""acid face splashings"" if you want to see the true face of Islam's treatment of women (hint: they are considered owned property and not granted legal personhood, which is at least ten percent worse than Hobby Lobby not paying for your birth control pills). "
1561,dnzp2xc,"**FYI to everyone who thinks Muslim women are oppressed:** *Most* women in the western world decide to wear it themselves if they do wear a burqa. I agree that if your family or spouse pressured you to wear one then you shouldn’t wear one simply because you don’t want to, but even wearing one because of that makes certain Muslim oppressive, not Islam. 

It shouldn’t be compared to wearing a ski mask as that has no religious meaning, unlike the hijab (which burqa falls under)"
1562,do0qtu7,"The so called 'choice' is limited. Muslim women are only required to only wear a certain style of Islamic clothing that can be considered as a hijab. They don't have the choice to wear a hoody, balaclava or any other style of clothing of their choice that does not abide to certain cultural guidelines. Restrictions are placed on how much should and which body parts should be covered. This does not sound like much of a choice to me. 

Also, the basic idea of wearing a hijab is inherently sexist because only women are suppose to be modest and cover up, not the men. It is basically done to help men from getting tempted by lust. Instead of teaching boys from childhood to control their lust, girls are taught to be modest. Yes, men are required to 'lower their gaze' when they see a woman,according to some Islamic teachings, but even this hardly imposed and hard to monitor.  

"
1563,do0rkk0,"First one, the worst one imo:

&gt;Since by wearing hijab you are automatically cutting back on that desire to look good, you are now focusing on other aspects of your life, such as your personality, education and your goals.

This seems like a anti-aestheticism, anti-objectification feminist take on choosing to wear the hijab to me even it is apparently based in faith. The important part is ""why is it wrong for someone to find this empowering?"", which your comment doesnt address.

Second article:

&gt;As I became a teenager, I struggled with trying to fit in, because though I was a little feminist at heart, I was still a girl. I had the desire to be pretty, a desire to be liked for my looks. I tried very hard for many years, but I always wondered why girls had to wear less clothing to be attractive while men looked their finest in a three piece suit.

Heading in the same direction as the first, she seems to wear it to buck social taboos and mentally comfort herself from stressing about being complacent in perceived forms of objectification she doesnt like.

&gt;Contrary to what most people think, I had to fight my family to wear hijab. They were completely against it. 

So this is a woman choosing to wear it in spite of her family, this does not seem characteristic of the common depiction of the hijab as oppressive. 

It seems like when offered the choice to determine why they do or do not wear the hijab, women can formulate reasons much more nuanced than can be inferred from what we imagine when we think of women wearing the hijab because their country forces them to.

Third article:

&gt;For some it represents spirituality, modesty and the observance of religious customs codified in the Koran.

&gt;To others, it’s a symbol of oppression, making the act of wearing it incompatible with feminism in modern society.

This one opens with making a distinction.

&gt;“For me, exercising ‘choice’ to cover is what makes the wearing of the hijab very much a feminist act, especially in the face of fierce opposition from so many different angles,” she tells RendezView.

&gt;But what about those who don’t have a choice?

&gt;“There’s no denying that my faith is used to justify the subjugation of women in many parts of the Muslim world and this is a reality that really troubles me,” Veiszadeh says. “This is why we must ensure the voices of Australian Muslim women are not silenced in a manner that limits or ignores their individual agency.”

It goes into an interesting ethical question, not as much as I'd like, but it acknowledges it. 

&gt;“Before I put the scarf on, I had 24 body piercings and blue hair. So I was always frowned upon anyway. You’re never going to make people happy. They’re going to judge you no matter what.”

Seems like she just wears it to express that she's edgy tbh.

Either way, I understand some of these views more than others but I imagine these headlines (which I've seen circulated on twitter, 4chan, youtube etc) are written in a way thats intended to draw outrage, confusion, or other visceral reactions that make people want to read them, or at least click them. 

They're clickbait, sure, but it doesn't seem that they're saying the hijab as its used oppressively in some of the Middle East is empowering. They're saying the choice can be empowering, choosing to do it for x reasons can be empowering, the focus doesn't seem to be especially secular in any of the articles. 

We have a visceral interpretation of what the hijab means that seems to be thought of as objective by a lot of people and, not without reason, it invokes a lot of feelings of rage, uncomfortableness, etc. for us. The taboos resulting from those feelings lead to a lot of assumptions that, in a country where people can (and do) make relatively unorthodox choices, are sometimes better explained by nuanced, personal views/experiences. I imagine even some religious Muslims can even choose to wear the hijab and still keep generally tolerant values that oppose authoritarian, theocratic values of their own country.

Those views can be illogical, or hard to understand/relate to, but projecting the idea that any who claims the hijab can be empowering is subscribing to how its used by theocratic regimes in the Middle East seems short-sighted. 

"
1564,do13h6t,"&gt; CMV: None of you have any stats that say muslim women are forced into the hijab.

*Any?* There are entire countries where wearing the hijab is legally enforced, [like Saudi Arabia and Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#Compulsion_and_pressure).

"
1565,doibr4t,"I think your argument doesn't take into account the distinction between attention in general and specifically sexual attention. A woman who walks out dressed like a monkey is likely to get a lot of attention, but she probably won't get as much *sexual* attention as a woman who wears stilettos and a mini skirt. My impression (and I don't pretend to be an Islamic scholar) is that Muslim women are encouraged to dress in a way that discourages specifically sexual attention, not necessarily attention in general. While Muslim women who wear a hijab in the west do stand out, they stand out because of their religion and not because of their sexuality."
1566,domuq5p,"&gt; I thought the hijab was about keeping a strict standard of modesty.

Modesty is certainly one of the reasons given, and quite likely the one that prevents Western liberals from pressing further, because who actually wants to tell a woman to stop being modest? But if modesty was actually the pressing concern of Muslim women, they should all be wearing burqas instead of hijabs, since burqas are more modest.

&gt; I may be uninformed but I was under the impression it was a religious belief instead of a political statement.

You are uninformed, but it's nothing that can't be rectified. Most Muslim women are just trying to live their lives. The political aspect is imposed by the patriarchy in these communities who subscribe to conservative, Islamist ideology.

&gt; Also I don't appreciate the nuance between being anti Muslim and anti Islam. I thought Islam was the religion and muslims were the believers.

It's an important distinction to understand. Islam *is* the religion, Muslims *are* the believers. Terms like ""Islamophobia"" seek to conflate the two, so that any criticism of the doctrines of Islam is seen as attacks on Muslims themselves, and as such are labeled as bigotry.

Western liberals need to start standing up for their own culture in order to preserve the freedoms we currently enjoy - freedoms we have a duty to pass on to the next generation."
1567,domv6jq,"But the point still stands that Muslim women are not supposed to have a choice about hijab weather they're following the rules or not. That being said, all the Muslim kids I've met at college so far don't seem to follow the Quran at all. They smoke , drink , don't wear hijab etc. So I think in America anyways it looks like Islam is changing with the younger generation. "
1568,doqt4pt,"Bismillah. I can see that you're getting a little excited.

&gt; No it's the logical conclusion of your idea.
&gt; Was it done for religious reasons? Yes
&gt; Did the Prophet saws allow it. Yes.

That is your argument. Mine (and the consensus) is that #1 is No.

SAW doing something, does not make it Sunnah. For example, SAW married more than 4 wives. It is neither Sunnah to marry 4 wives (AFAIK) nor to marry more than 4 (which is in fact haram).

&gt;That makes it's Sunnah. Since if it's a religious action it's either Sunnah Fard or bidah. That's the categories religious actions fall into. Salah Fard. Smiling Sunnah. And so on
By denying the Sunnah and fard what do you think your insisting?
Seriously? The four madhabs put it under either Sunnah or fard just saying.

Your initial premise is incorrect, thus everything that follows is irrelevant. My argument is that it is NOT sunnah. Your duty is to prove otherwise. Islam places a high importance to consensus. Are you saying all the billions of hijabis (and their families) during and since SAW and in the future are are deluded? Perhaps it is simply more reasonable that you're wrong?

&gt;But let me show evidence of it being fard.

Thank you for eventually attempting to provide evidence (4 comments late.) I tire of people simply arguing for the sake of it, rather than to learn. I am glad I got you to convert. *However*, you still did not provide proof regarding the 4 school of thoughts, for some reason. You simply copy/pasted a bunch of ambiguous hadith then wrote """"Hanbali madhabs believes it to be wajib. A whole madhab"" as if they are related. Of course, I googled it myself since you've clearly refused several times to provide evidence. The Hanbali school of thought 

First of all, scholars themselves differ on the details. We laymen have no right to argue differently either way. 
Secondly, the niqab of our time is **not** the same as of the time of SAW.
**Our debate is whether or not the niqab is cultural.** Yes, today's niqab IS cultural. As you can easily tell, different cultures use niqabs differently. I lived in the ME for several years (which also renders your rant about ""western sensibilities"" inane), and I only recall *once* seeing a niqabi! ONCE. YEARS. And she was being forced by her husband! No one I met agreed with that. Also, there were niqabs before SAW. To say niqabs are uncorrelated of religion is naive. But to say they ground in religion (Islam specifically) is not much better. The final point is, some consider it religious, some do not. Either way, a majority do not consider it a hijab (in the sense of covering the Aawrah for men and women.) As you said yourself, only the Hanbalis consider it wajib (and unreasonable, at least in the 'West'), not fard.

&gt; Ibn Jarir (Rahimahullah) with an authentic chain of narrators has quoted Ibn Abbaas' (Radhiallaahu Ánhu) opinion was ""that the Muslim women are ordered to cover their head and faces with outer garments except for one eye."" (This is quoted in the Ma'riful Qur'an in the tafseer of Surah Ahzaab ayah # 33, with reference of Ibn Jarir with a sahih chain of narrators).

Surat Ahzab Aya 33: And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as [was] the display of the former times of ignorance. And establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah intends only to remove from you the impurity [of sin], O people of the [Prophet's] household, and to purify you with [extensive] purification.

Out of curiosity, how is this Aya relevant? Also, give me Ibn Jarir's full name. There are a ton of Ibn Jarirs.

Additionally, how many people do you see that follow this: ""the Muslim women are ordered to cover their head and faces with outer garments except for **one eye.""** ??? You think that maybe something is wrong here? According to you logic, the hijabis have it wrong and the niqabies have it wrong too!

&gt; So yeah cultural?
""So yeah, religious? Suuuuuuure.""

1569,doscbh6,"Actually scholars are not clear on that, some state [that not even the hijab is religiously mandatory](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/12/21/as-muslim-women-we-actually-ask-you-not-to-wear-the-hijab-in-the-name-of-interfaith-solidarity/?utm_term=.1e5765e466fa)

1570,dm7peco,"&gt; From early to mid-morning, there is an opportunity to breathe freely on what is known as ""car-free Sunday"".

kek, that won't be lasting long if these women have their way; breathing freely through a little gap in the veil your forced to wear would just make me claustrophobic (granted I'm a man so do the ladies have any relevant opinions on this matter).

&gt; The group's leader, Triken Sholihat, fears Indonesian Muslim women are becoming too liberal in what they wear.

Wait, did they start wearing their faces instead of a burqa. How terrible we must do something about this ASAP. S.N. Heavy sarcasm here.

&gt; ""Many women are not aware that wearing the hijab is obligatory according to the Koran.""

I'm not a Muslim or hijab advocate, in fact I personally despise both but the hijab didn't even exist when Muhammad was alive (from what I've read), how the hell did it make it's way into the quran.

&gt; A Passer By: ""I only wear a hijab at school. They asked me if I'd be willing to wear one now and I said I will,"" she told the ABC.

Anyone else think this was taken under duress or just a flat out lie. Poor girl.

&gt; Indonesia is widely seen as a moderate Muslim nation, but there is concern that some religious teachings are changing and that beyond the hijab, women are being urged to also cover their faces.

f*ck Saudi Arabia is spreading, someone do something quick. It's only a few short steps from this to outright mandatory sharia law I.E. Death to all apostates and non-Muslims.

&gt; And while there are no official figures, he believes there are noticeably more Indonesian women choosing to fully cover their faces.

God please tell me this isn't a trend. If this becomes common place it'll never leave, people will be shamed into continuing it long past when they want to stop.

&gt; ""Wearing a face cover is about the strength of faith in somebody, if someone lacks the faith they won't be able to wear a face cover,"" she says.

So covering your face gives u faith, is this a lack of confidence thing, is that why u want to cover up?"
1571,dmabnh4,"Nice to see another Mallu Muslim woman on reddit. My experiences are different to yours. I grew up in a very liberal Muslim family. We weren't very religious. Prayers were few. And even Ramadan fasting was rare. We did celebrate Eid though. Must have the biryani :)).

When I moved back to India for college, is when I became more conscious of my Muslim identity. And began learning more about Islam. Within few months, I was praying 5 times and fasting. Within a year, I donned the hijab. It felt very liberating like I was in control of my life. I did not need approval from anybody, did not need to dress to please anybody etc. Initially family was surprised, bit unpleasant. But overtime things have changed. My mother and sister too now wear hijabs. 

I don't feel religious duties or donning the hijabs come in the way of pursuing higher education. I see a lot more hijabis today in higher education and working. I guess the hypocrites have always existed but I see a trend where Muslim women are exploring avenues they weren't used to earlier especially entrepreneurship. I see a lot in the field of hijabi fashion. This is not just in India. Even in the Middle East, Europe or US.

Even the scholars have undergone a lot of change. I see a lot of western Muslim scholars who are tech savvy and on social media. How religion is viewed and how its been practised is also changing. I see more parents are comfortable with the idea of their daughters going abroad and studying compared to earlier years. Things are definitely changing. "
1572,dmaoz80,"Oh yeah, I read your thread. I wear hijab and I don't like seeing muslim men putting down other women for not wearing the hijab or covering their aurat the ""proper"" way. 

What you said is true, just because someone wears a hijab doesn't automatically mean they're an angel, I know I'm not. I also have friends who wear the hijab but are not virgins. Even though they have repented or get married to the ones they committed the act with, that regret still haunts them until now. 

Being a woman is complicated, same as being a muslim, not to mention also being a person of color. However most muslim women are poc, and attacking them or undermining their faith for things like not wearing the hijab/socks/looser clothing/niqab is pure nonsense. "
1573,dmetm7m,"A Hijab is not a symbol of oppression in the western world. Women of the Islamic faith wear Hijabs because it's liberating. Men aren't forcing their wives to wear a Hijab and it's a personal choice Muslim women are making for themselves. Plenty of women at my college wear a Hijab because it's a faith tradition they want to carry and preserve. What I dislike about the the feminist movement today is we pinpoint and target women who wear Hijabs and think that they need to be saved from their ""abusive husbands"". Take the time to educate yourself and learn that it's just a faith tradition these women want to follow. You can also compare a Hijab to what a Nun wears on her head or what an Orthodox Jewish woman covers her hair with (either a head scarf or a wig). We never question a Catholic nun or a Jewish woman about being oppressed by their husbands or by the Bible/Tanakh but god forbid someone wears a Hijab, everyone point fingers at Muslim men and the Quran for oppressing them.  [Rutgers University-Women Who Wear Hijabs](https://youtu.be/aLV6nPDcVYw) "
1574,dmeyh23,"The reason many Muslim women wear the veil is the same as the reason many young Mormons don't drink coffee, why some Hindus don't eat beef, and why Orthodox Jewish women wear wigs.

It was imposed on them since childhood. While wearing *hijab* is only *fardh* (means compulsory) upon puberty, and wearing the *niqab* (face veil) and *burqa* (full-body covering) are not *fardh* but only suggestions, many Muslim women are given veils to wear even in childhood. This makes the parents' jobs easier-if she's wearing the veil enthusiastically as a kid because she doesn't know anything and thinks it's cool, it's easier to enforce said veil once she's sexually mature. It's a form of psychological conditioning. Like when Baptist priests tell children in Sunday School that Catholics and Muslims and Hindus are all heretics, and that gay people and atheists are deviants. This is common in almost every organised religion.

 also, [this article](https://www.thecut.com/2017/07/8-queer-muslim-women-on-the-power-of-the-bold-type.html) is about how a few muslim women have already felt represented by Adena &amp; so forth.

Don't try to flip the script and act as though the majority of muslim women are living in cages, dominated by brown bearded men. That is simply not true. The vast vast majority of hijab wearing women do so out of their own free will and a desire to follow the commandments of their faith. 

Why don't you try actually speaking to them instead of assigning roles to them in your mind? Truly - instead of talking online about something you have little to no knowledge of why not actually speak to these women that you think are so oppressed and see what they have to say?

&gt; Not all Muslim women are, either. That's my point about context. And historically, there absolutely was an obligation for women (and men) to enter religious service.

So unless the whole crux of your argument centers on your assertion that ALL muslim women are forced to wear the hijab, in which case, please - cite some sources, it *is* very much comparable. Because if you're saying that only SOME women are forced into becoming nuns, and SOME women are forced to wear the hijab, what's the difference?

&gt; My mother in law actually was forced into a convent by her father so I guess that's a point for you, but since none of her six sisters were, that's six points for me.

I didn't realize we were keeping score, but surely you get penalized points for using anecdotal evidence. 

Look, as much as I enjoy the sport of getting into arguments on the internet - and I mean, I kind of do, I'm not in this to ""win."" I'm genuinely curious to understand why you think it's comparing apples to oranges.

Turning this into a semantic debate about my choice of the word ""obligation"" rather than comparing nuns to women who wear hijab seems intellectually dishonest. But if your motivation is to win the argument at any cost, well, I'll save you the effort and let you have it."

&gt;&gt;In recent times, the resurgence of the hijab along with various countries’ enforcement of it has led many to believe that Muslim women are required by their faith to wear the hijab. In this informative talk, novelist Samina Ali takes us on a journey back to Prophet Muhammad's time to reveal what the term “hijab” really means -- and it's not the Muslim woman's veil! So what does “hijab” actually mean, if not the veil, and how have fundamentalists conflated the term to deny women their rights? This surprising and unprecedented idea will not only challenge your assumptions about hijab but will change the way you see Muslim women.

1584,dn2a7dd,"You added more to your comment, so here is my response to the new portion:

""If you could pinpoint anything about me commenting about me wanting to wear it because of modesty your accusations would have merit.""

what am i accusing you of? Your reaction on exposed hair makes it seem like hair is another vagina to you.  You take generalizations and make them specific, then specifics and make them general so that you wont have to analyze anything with any depth.  Remember, I was in the same position you are now in, I understand.

Yes. I'd be wearing it for OCD. I thought that I was arguing about other women here, and how they see it as a religious symbol, not myself

I dont know what you are arguing, or why.  You seem extremely outraged that hijab is not a choice and are taking it out on me.  I did not put that in your religion, nor did i encourage your god to reveal any of this to the pedophile prophet.  I dont care what you do or why, just be honest.

A want is an entity that is not essential for our survival but something we'd sacrifice or do if we got the opportunity to do so. This is really 9th grade business class
Having germs on my body is not going to kill me. The germs are not oppressing me. I do, however, feel uncomfortable with them.

a want is a desire.  it has nothing to do with survival or anything else.  Its in the dictionary.  Your relationship with cloth and germs is your own business.  I honestly dont care how you live your life, you are a grown adult.  I'm sorry you are uncomfortable with them, though.  I dislike seeing another human suffer.  I hope one day you are at peace with germs, they are essential to life and its impossible to completely eradicate them.

Can you give me proof that my society is forcing me to wear it?

I dont know you or your life.  Muslim women are forced to wear hijab because of their religion.  That you personally dont find god a reason to wear a scarf, that is you and you are allowed to do whatever you want as an adult.  As a muslim, however, you are not pleasing god by wearing hijab.  

And they have been commanded no more than this: To worship Allah, offering Him sincere devotion, being true (in faith); to establish regular prayer; and to practice regular charity; and that is the Religion Right and Straight ~ Surah Bayyinah 98:5

On the authority of Omar bin Al-Khattab, who said : I heard the messenger of Allah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam say : “Actions are but by intention and every man shall have but that which he intended. Thus he whose migration was for Allah and His messenger, his migration was for Allah and His messenger, and he whose migration was to achieve some worldly benefit or to take some woman in marriage, his migration was for that for which he migrated.” ~ Related by Bukhari and Muslim 

so you can cross that reason of your long list of reasons.

 Last time I checked, I am simply too exhausted to leave the house, shifted my home two months ago and started wearing this cloth a month ago during a time when I know of nobody but my family.

When did your fear of germs develop?  It must have been around that time, because you are wearing your hijab because of germs.  It must be difficult to have OCD develop so severe so quickly.  My sympathies, friend.   

 Another generalization, and one without any proof, huh?

I'm not sure what you are referring to here, please elaborate.  

"
1585,dn3lnxd,"Why can't we just let people wear what they want to wear? If some one wants to wear skirts, shorts, or hijabs etc who gives a shit ffs. 

There's people in Australia campaigning because they think Muslim women are opposed for wearing the hijab and burqa but at the same time school girls have only just gained the right to wear fucking pants?! 

How about we stop dictating what women can and can't do with their bodies and just leave them to dress how they want to. "
1586,dn45toz,"There's a wide variety of hijab styles. Muslim women are endlessly inventive with styling their headgear. I'd say, where I live (Egypt) there's probably a 50-50 split between women who wear their cover like a turban or hat (like the woman in the photo) and women who wear a more ""draped"" style that covers the neck. (There are also many who don't cover.)"
1587,dn6pdcr,"I don't like it and I don't think women who claim to be free should wear one.

We know that many women, both in Norway and around the world DON'T have a choice. They'll face repercussions (socially and/or legally) if they don't wear the hijbab. In solidarity with those who are not free to choose, women should ditch the hijab and it sadness me that so few muslim women are willing to stand up for their sisters. "
1588,dn85i3n,"Oh not this shit again. You're gonna tell me those nuns didn't grow up in a catholic family which didnt have any influence on their decisions. Most muslim women are NOT forced to wear a fucking hijab, not in Europe at least. And they may not need qualification, but they have to face xenophobic treatment from many people, unlike nuns. Enough with your brainwash bullshit."
1589,dndig4x,"&gt; You have to teach kids to accept people who are different

Sure, but you also need to teach kids that the majority of Muslim women are forced to cover up. This has nothing to do with free will. Spend an hour on r/exmuslim and you will see how girls and women are pressured to wear hijab, are forced into arranged marriages ..."
1590,djnlgch,"You can't understand idiots who've been brainwashed. They want it because they're brainwashed to believe that that is the right way. Doesn't need much explaining.

I mean a lot of Islamic women are the same way about hijab anyways, even though they are the ones wearing it so they know it isn't comfortable. So no surprise that men are strongly for it."
1591,dktj0aq,"There are so many things that piss me off about that picture *and* the people leaving comments in that thread. So many layers and layers of issues, I dont even know where to begin. 

Issue 1: Here's a picture of a muslim woman, in her best/highest expression of hijab, next to a muslim man in his poorest/lowest expression of hijab. Now lets judge an entire religion based on how these two people express their religiosity. And of course, no woman would EVER want to be that modest. Ever. ALL women want to show off their bodies. Conclusion: all muslim women are oppressed/brain-dead invalids, all muslim men are pigs. 

The people leaving these comments are doing to women what men have been doing to women for centuries. Invalidating their choices (by calling them ""stupid/naive/inexperienced/brainwashed""), taking away their voices, and speaking for them. And then they have the audacity to call all muslim men sexist and islam a sexist religion. The hypocrisy of these people. 

Issue 2: There *is* a double standard which some muslims refuse to acknowledge. Women are expected to be in their *best* form, nothing less than the ""perfect"" and highest level of hijab, but men can meet the bare-minimum level of hijab and they're saints. Again, hypocrisy of people. 

Ignorance and hypocrisy all around. "
1592,dkwws58,"Muslim women are not religiously obligated to dress a certain way. They are command to dress modestly. In countries where hijab is prevalent, covered women dress in a zillion different ways while respecting the calls for modesty. Saudi and Afghan are representative of their own local cultures and do not represent Islam specifically or the greater Muslim world. "
1593,dl6ctkt,"I never said shit about Hijab ya dummy. I said these sharia countries other brutal punishments for small offenses is why Muslim women are probably so obedient. Not because it's ""their choice"" as much as they would say that. In the Koran it's viewed as a ""grave offense to the prophet and to allah"" for a woman not to wear a hijab so even if they don't get physically punished they are damned to a place with ""fires 70 times hotter then hell"". So I guess that's fine. "
1594,dl7elmu,"look i'm not trying to say they don't but if you look at anywhere in Europe. The Millions that don't care don't actively do anything in their communities to stop it. You got London, France, Fucking Greece. Islam is something big need of reform. I mean we can all rah rah rah about women's rights but as long as we still fetishize the hijab and saying that muslim women are empowered individuals. we won't make any progress. this is coming from someone who grew up in a muslim majority part of Southside Philadelphia. "
1595,dlah3uy,"Culture, not religion.  Are they Pakistan, Afghani, or Iranian, by chance? 

Some insight:

A lot of Westerners do not understand that Islam, like Christianity, has a shit-ton of sects and different variants.  Generally, we hear about Shi'a vs. Sunni; this is like saying Protestant vs. Catholic.  While it's not wrong, it's not entirely correct, either. 

To answer your question:
It depends on the country.  Moroccans, Jordanians, Lebanese, and sometimes Turkish, for instance, are generally the more 'liberal' Muslims in that they freely associate with non-Muslims, only wear a hijab (or not at all), practice reproduction control, etc.  Most are pretty moderate, but occasionally, you'll meet the ""fundie"" equivalents.  Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq (Daesh), and Pakistan are the most extreme in their views.  But even then, there are plenty of Pakistanis in the UK who are like Westerners.  

Your neighbors are just assholes who happen to practice a more stringent form of Islam.  Yes, Muslim women are allowed to speak with other women.  It's mixed-gender relations that are touchier. While I can understand about the dogs, as in Middle Eastern culture, they're considered unclean, the rest of it just points to them being absolute losers and are using culture as an excuse to act like pigs.

Suggestions:

1. Document everything and put security cameras in if you're allowed and can afford them.  They can't claim racism by camera.

2. If you're partnered or married to a man, have HIM talk to the husband.  The wife won't question the authority of a male asking to speak with her husband.  Sexist, yes, but effective. 

"
1596,dlinndb,"Ahh nice to see that you don't have a single argument besides cheap insults. So you're not a troll, just stupid. 

And yes you're extremely uneducated, otherwise you would first of all not believe in some idiotic sky fairy and secondly you would at least know what that shitty book of yours teaches. I understand that you don't like facts that don't fit into the narrative.

&gt;Bitch im in islamic school

Wow I feel truly sorry for you. I advise you take up the quran and actually read it and learn about the religion through facts, not through what some uneducated imans and ""scholars"" tell you.

And yes, muslim women are not only forced to wear the hijab they are also extremely oppressed.
"
1597,dlt8zit,"I agree with your first paragraph but, while I understand your discomfort, I don't agree. It was coordinating and part of the whole look. Many Muslim women are very fashionable and put together beautiful outfits which include coordinating hijab. She's dressing and designing for the millions of women and young girls who cover their heads and want stylish, complete, fashion-forward outfits. All of those girls and women deserve to see fashion that is relevant to them. "
1598,dlx1qls,And only repressed Muslim women are forced to wear hijab... So what's your actual point or are you just virtue signaling?
1599,dm0ylhd,"I'm not going to deny that yes, there's women in the world who are forced to wear it, but I imagine because of the stigma in America, it's being presented as more of a personal choice than a religious requirement. A lot of muslim women are even annoyed with the fact that some feminists think that they're being oppressed by wearing a hijab because it was their choice to wear one."
1600,djox8pf,"Would not approach.

&gt;but I wear it enough such that it is a part of my social and formal identity.

Don't make clothing a part of your identity. Let your personality stand for that. 

&gt;I can't completely take it off because I'm still partially dependent on my family (even though I no longer live with them) and they would be severely disappointed if I took it off.

This is the western society. They have literally no say in what you dress in and if a piece of clothing is what keeps them ""happy"" you need to not do what they wish, but what you wish. It is a shitty situation to be in, but no one but you have the power to change that, and it is a simple as just not wearing it. If they do ANYTHING to you law enforcement can always knock on the door. I do have to say that family matters is nothing I care for. If my family would not want me to do what I want I say fuck them all and I leave. I come from a very individualistic upbringing, and that gives me this kind of perspective. 

If you live in a regular western country you won't be able to date many men which isn't within islam already. Most of us associate the hijab with the religion, and religion is not something I personally would deal with. Not touch with a stick even. It is also known that muslim women are not allowed to date other non-muslim men, so rarely do men approach women in hijab, let alone want to get into trouble if they get too close to women with hijabs. It's a fear that isn't completely unjistified. It might be ignorant as not all muslims are like that, but Islam as a relgion has yet to show its secular values in the west and thus it is difficult. 

If you want dating to be a ""pleasant"" experience you will have to remove the hijab. Otherwise you will probably only meet muslim men. That is not coming from discrimination or ignorance, but rather from the reality of how things are currently looking. The hijab is not only a piece of cloth, but also a symbol of many things which most guys who aren't religious do not deem it as symbol of freedom, but rather the other way around. 

That is my take on it. Let your personality be the up front facade and put the hijab to the side. Otherwise you will probably, and most likely, only attract other muslim men. "

My ass sure does know to cite its sources. "
1603,dju3lok,"Not all muslim women are intimidated into wearing hijabs.  
A lot of muslim women have frowned upon the idea of only gaining social respect when they are covered (and erased), as I'm sure you are aware of.   
And they can indeed organize around the basis of their sexual identity as an oppressed social class rather than stick with their family and surroundings because their husbands and sons said so. (This has always been the downfall of women liberation movements.)    
I'd like to believe that it is possible. Women have done it before and muslim women are not any different.  
Such organization can be started up by any muslim women, not just hijab wearing muslim women. That is okay in my book. What would not be okay is men starting it.  
We actually need women organizing world wide. I wish they would do it much more frequent and on a larger scale.  
One can only dream, I guess. And I have no balls to start one where I currently am in this world.  
I dream of the day to see an arabic muslim woman on youtube with her own feminist vlog. I love these catchy north american feminist youtubers regardless of some of their mainstream annoying content, and I do wish there was someone I can relate more to though. Fuck arabic society for shaming women into the shades of this world. Also fuck youtubers for giving such a strong platform for islam converts hijab wearing youtubers. "
1604,djupib3,"Honestly to me it seems like these endless make-up, heels, sexy clothing, modest clothing debates. I think that Muslim women are perfectly up to the task of deciding these things in theory but in practice there is still way too much coercion and pressure. But it's a lot more complex than ""all = good"" or ""all = bad"". Even parents forcing the girls to wear the hijab... I mean there are plenty of people who pressure their kids into a lot of things that we tolerate. We just have to set a minimal set of things kids need to be able to do, like attend school sports, and the rest, well, we were all fucked up by our parents to some degree and learn to deal with this heritage as adults... We won't legislate away every superstition. We have to make a distinction between what is frankly domestic violence and what is just cultural gender expectations. The latter can be fought efficiently with increased opportunities. The first is stuff that you need the state for."
1605,djxzp4s,"It's generally a bit weird to see someone state ""muslim women are always covered""... I mean I understand what the question is, but there are so many ways to wear hijab, and also plenty of muslim women who don't."
1606,djzlx0s,"There is so much wrong in your comment: 

Firstly: Everyone should have the freedom to wear whatever they desire, and even though some Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab, that doesn't give you the right to assume all Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab.

Secondly: The West have their own values as to how to live their life. Islam also have their own values. It seems like you prefer Western values more than Islam's values, thus thinking Islamic values are wrong or oppressive.


Thirdly: If we want to stop women from being forced to wear the hijab by their oppresive cultures, we have to stop assuming all Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab. By that mentality, you will never help those women who are actually forced to wear the hijab. Because the truth is, not all Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab. That is the truth which ex-Muslims and alike should accept."
1607,dk2kdks,"That is often the case. Muslim women are not singled out, they just make a fuss about it and consider themselves victims because of their religious motivations. 

Some people believe that the Burqa should be an exception as it is a religious symbol and cite ""freedom of religion"" or ""freedom of expression"" etc. But they disregard the safety, security and social issues the Burqa creates.

They are welcome to wear the Hijab as it does not conceal their identity.
"
1608,dkas5ny,"Verses like these show that there is equality of gender equality with the Divine.

Believing men and believing women are supporters and protectors of each other:
They enjoin goodness and forbid evil;
They establish prayer and give charity;
They obey Allah and His Messenger.
Allah will shower mercy upon them.
Truly, God is Mighty, Wise.
(Quran, 9:71)

In Islam, Eve isn't blamed for eating the fruit and cursed with childbirth.  Both Adam and Eve eat the apple and God forgives them both.  Females have been the teachers of great men like Ibn Arabi.  Women in church history were not allowed to speak in churches.  Women have done the research and realized its only patriarchy that stopped them from giving sermons and leading prayers. It was done in the time of the Prophet.

Any inequality belongs to humanity's observations.  A woman was not less equal if she inherited less. It was because men were the providers of women.  Women had the right to own property. Women in the US needed a man to co-sign until 1976.  Women could vote.  Women in our country did not have the right to vote until 1920.  So it has been progressive for centuries.  

And now it there is a problem with patriarchy and dominating forces. In 1950s Egypt, no one wore hijab.  The same in Iran.  Now women in Iran are punished if they don't wear their hijab.  Now women in Saudi Arabia are treated like little children.  Look at the actual history of women in those times.  Women worked. Something women didn't start doing until the 70s in USA.  They were stuck home raising the children.

You will find some misogyny in almost all religions. Buddha said females can't be Boddhisattvas in one of his texts.  Christians wouldn't allow women to speak in church.  They had to have their husbands speak for them. Etc.....

Many women....modern liberal progressive Muslim women are living empowered by Islam's teachings about women.  (google Amina Wadud).  Maybe you should get to know them.  I looked through your latest comments.  You seem to spend your time making anti-islamic claims.  I doubt you ask the question to hear an answer.  Am I right?

"
1609,dkc5n41,"Except that Muslim women are TELLING you that they find the choice empowering and are reclaiming the hijab and niqab for themselves. Discouraging them and insisting that you know better is infantilising and taking power away from these women.

You don't fight disempowerment by fighting women who are empowering themselves, that's disempowering."
1610,dkcafai,"I've seen some things countering anti-hijab stuff.

Maybe that's what you saw?


Is ""Muslim women should be allowed to wear the hijab"" supporting the hijab? Or is it supporting Muslim women?

Are you saying support for the hijab IS support for rape culture?

That seems extreme.
"
1611,dkfpphi,"I don't see any problem with Apple introducing a hijab emoji and I'm as far from euphoric atheism as I can be, but there is no need to downplay the fact that some Muslim women *are* forced to wear the hijab. Speaking as an ex-muslim myself who actually does know an is friends with many Muslim women, I know many who have chosen to wear the hijab, but I also know many who were given no choice in the matter. Maybe it's different where you live, but I'm living in an Islamic country right now and if you really think there is no social backlash to taking off the hijab, you're sadly wrong."
1612,dkjzplc,"Ehh. I would say more than half wear head scarves(or some similar head covering). Not for legal reasons though.  A lot of Muslim women like wearing the headscarve as a symbol of their religion. Now niqab(face covering) or burqa(full body covering), those are far less worn. Maybe not even a third wear the niqab. 

I won't deny that a number of Muslim women are forced to wear hijab but I would say the majority of Muslim women wearing the hijab or other head covering are doing it on their own will. 

 "
1613,dkldqb7,"&gt;It is very different; being a nun is a choice a very slim percent of women choose this lifestyle.

The percentage is arbitrary and doesn't matter whether 1 person in the world is a nun or 5 billion are nuns. Rather it's about the concept and idea of it, which stays the same regardless of number.

&gt;Many Muslim women are not given this choice and DO have to wear the garb. When you're walking around on a brutally hot day and see these women covered head to toe and I'm sweating in a t shirt and shorts I feel for them.

I obviously agree, but how does this condemn the hijab and the burka for those that just choose to wear it because of their faith and so on? I don't understand. The hijab and the burqa are not oppressive by default. This isn't a problem with said clothing, it's a problem with the people who force it for their own reasons, so why not focus on them entirely instead of trying to denounce said clothing?"
1614,dklffhd,"Except the woman in the picture looks happy as hell. Maybe you should stop acting like all western-Muslim women are oppressed for simply wearing headscarves.

Edit: I'm a part of a Muslim family. Some women choose to wear headscarves, and some women don't. We really need to stop acting like all western-Muslim women have no choice in the matter. Conservative, religious families do force their daughters and wives to wear hijabs, but  with my friends and family, it's mainly a choice. Not every western-Muslim feels oppressed by a hijab. Yes, there a too many that are forced to do so, but not every western-Muslim women feels oppressed by a hijab."
1615,dklfjy5,"&gt;When did I ever argue against the idea of someone choosing to be religious? I never even stated their lives were shit. Are you okay?

""Choosing to wear the hijab because of religious freedom is bad and near impossible and unlikely"" is an axiom of your arguement.

&gt;My claim is that majority of Muslim women are not given the choice on wearing the hijab. You said ""but what about all those western Muslims and liberated eastern Muslims?"" Well, those populations only make up 3% of the entire Muslim world. I've addressed your nonsense, and all you've added to this conversation is words which I'm not entirely sure you know their true meaning. I'm far right because I care about women being treated as subhuman?

Where are you pulling the statistic of 3% from? We both just agreed  almost a third of muslims being in the west? Are they all opressed?

And no, you're far right because you'd prefer a homogeneous society.

"
1616,dklh3zk,"So by not pointing out which countries mandate hijab, you feel that I'm calling for a homogenous society?  Haha. Does that even make sense to you? It seems you're using these words to deflect from addressing my one and only point. 

Majority (never said all) of Muslim women are not given the choice in regards to observing hijab. "
1617,di8m00r,"lol so did she stab herself multiple times? because it happened less than three years ago, it's erased from time and space? if not killed, muslim women are assaulted verbally and physically on a regular basis for wearing the hijab. 

but way to only focus on one of the things i said, even tho you were wrong about that too!"
1618,difnsbo,"Uhh, sure the Arab world pretty much sucks for women. But 80% of Muslims are not even Arab. So I'm not that lucky. I've also grown up around Muslims and the vast majority have opportunities like I do (although not AS MUCH). Very few are forced to wear hijab and so on. So these loser white non-Muslim men acting like they know all about Muslim women are pathetic."
1619,dim95uh,"Not all Muslim women are the same, not all of them wear the hijab for the exact same reasons, and it's *definitely* true that a lot of Muslim women (and non-Muslim women) wear makeup for themselves and their comfort, not to adorn themselves for men. Likewise, there is plenty of Islamic scholarship that doesn't have an issue with women wearing makeup.

Also, Muslim women don't ""make themselves uglier on purpose."" That is, many Muslim women don't feel that they are ""uglier"" because they wear hijab. For many of them, it's a distinguishing characteristic, it's a source of fulfillment, etc. Try talking to more Muslim women! They'll give you many different answers about why they wear the hijab."
1620,dinj6r8,"It sounds like you're just objectifying Muslim women as objects of an 'innocence' fetish, like /u/atillaauby said.

&gt;Of course I could try to convert them to Christianity, but I do not want to 1) get killed by her family 2) get her killed because she's dating a non-muslim 3) I don't want her to stop covering her hair.

/eyeroll

Besides this nonsense, Muslims don't date in the way you seem to expect, and women do not marry outside of the religion. If she's observant enough to wear hijab and meet your objectifying qualifications, then it's likely no relationship will happen between the two of you unless you convert to Islam or you divorce her from her faith.

Get a grip, Muslim women are not a sexual conquest for you."
1621,dis1g2u,"One could also make the same argument that wearing the hijab is hardly ever ""enforced"" in Islam or Muslim majority countries. Muslim women are essentially free to wear them or not. I've known dozens of Muslim women in Muslim countries who don't wear it and they are just fine."
1622,dit7do8,"&gt;""When a woman’s community acceptance, respect, dignity, employability, marriagiability, physical safety, enfranchisement, social mobility, access to social institutions, freedom, and autonomy hinge upon her daily, unwavering, public adherence to the bikini, then we can make this comparison.

This isn't the issue with a lot of Muslims in the West. What you're doing is saying that because something is true in part, it must be true as a whole. Also known as the fallacy of composition. This is simply not the issue in the West and we can stop pretending like redditors actually care about Muslims in the middle east. 


When a woman cannot leave her home in anything other than a bikini without being deemed immoral and her human worth and family’s honor compromised, then we can make this comparison.

&gt; again, this is not an issue in the West. Even among religious families in the West, wearing the hijab isn't a necessary component of honour. People who make this generalisation don't understand that it's a choice of women in the West and they aren't forced into it. 

When there are severe legal, social, and extrajudicial forces holding a woman’s safety, wellbeing, and livelihood hostage to her adherence to the bikini, then we can make this comparison.

&gt; not an issue in the West. 


(It should go without saying that some or all of the above systemic constraints manifest with variance across diverse Muslim communities.)

It’s a slap in the face, so hurtful and insulting a comparison it makes it hard for me to breathe looking at it.

You're essentially confusing two points. The first point is that Muslim women are not pressurised into wearing the hijab in the West and wearing the hijab in West should be seen as nothing more than an expression of identity and as an item of clothing. To say it's inherently oppressive or that women's rights are being taken away in the West is just silly. 

The reasons for the hijab are different in the US than they are in Saudi Arabia. There hasn't been an study to find out whether or not women who wear the hijab are forced into it, most Muslim women will tell you it's their own choice and it is a part of religion which is why the women who wear the hijab tend to be more religious than the ones who don't. Based on this I think it's reasonable to think that it's their own freewill. I'm not saying that women aren't forced into it like in the middle east but to say it's the same in the West is just absurd and insulting. To argue that it's inherently oppressive is also silly as I mentioned. The only way to know if it is inherently oppressive is to 1) ask the women if they feel oppressed and 2) ask their reasons for wearing it. If they don't feel oppressed and if they wear it out of their own freewill then it cannot be oppression. As I mentioned, you can see it as being oppressive independent of what the people who wear it feel but then that's not really a strong objective argument. You're just drawing your own conclusions based on what you feel may be true when it's proven to be false. "
1623,dittri5,"Muslim women are like vampires. When you take off their hijab, they melt in the sun."
1624,diu68wd,"Well, which Muslim states, exactly, ""enforce"" wearing the hijab and how is this representative of Islam? It seems Sam Harris and his ilk are not talking about Islam as a whole (rather a small minority of places) when they say Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab."
1625,diwpuzp,"No. Plenty of Muslim women in the US choose to wear the hijab, why wouldn't it be similar in Iran?

The hijab is a religious practice. Many Muslim women are religious and therefore choose to cover their heads. Or they grew up doing it and are just more comfortable that way. It's not my place to tell them they can't, the same as it's not my place to tell women they can't choose to be housewives, or to take their husband's last name when they get married."
1626,diwrfh8,"&gt;No. Plenty of Muslim women in the US choose to wear the hijab, why wouldn't it be similar in Iran?

Well I don't know, why don't we try to fight the Theocratic authoritarian state of Iran to free their women and find out? Rather than complain when a chess player does all the heavy lifting for us?

&gt;The hijab is a religious practice. Many Muslim women are religious and therefore choose to cover their heads.

Just a question.. do you legitimately believe that the hijab, burqa, niqab, or chador have absolutely nothing to do with sexism?

&gt; It's not my place to tell them they can't, the same as it's not my place to tell women they can't choose to be housewives, or to take their husband's last name when they get married.

But feminists *constantly* criticize the internalized misogyny that leads to many women choosing to be stay at home moms or take their husbands name. I see it literally all the time.

This is one thing at makes me quite angry about modern feminism. It has a complete blind spot when it comes to Islam and its inherent sexism. They either obfuscate or ignore the *codified, perfect word of God* being sexist in the Quran and Hadiths. 

If it were any other religion or Western culture they would have a field day criticizing all the sexist shit. And they do, which I applaud them for. I love a good feminist destruction of Catholicism. But if you aren't willing to do the same to Islam and their fucked up doctrines, then you're not being objective. "
1627,dixjvma,"&gt;I would argue the number of women wearing hassidic Jewish clothing is much less than Muslim women wearing hijabs.

Honestly, if you spent like 2 minutes in a Muslim community anywhere around you, you'd probably see that that's not the case.

In a mosque, everyone wears it, but outside, it's really not as common as people think. You just don't realize Muslim women are Muslim when they don't wear a hijab."
1628,diyf8ec,"Perhaps you are ignorant to the phenomena of the school or workplace dress code which forces girls and women in select situations to wear skits/dresses. You may also be ignorant to the reality that not all Muslim women are forced to wear hijabs, only a select few are forced in select situations. The hijab alone is a symbol of modesty and devotion of faith. Most religions practice modesty in dress as a way for women to prove devotion. The more flesh a woman covers, the more respect she is believed to shows toward herself and her faith in God. Most cultures around the world have men seeing women as more respectable if they cover their bodies, even with religion out of the picture. Those are the apparent rules of sexism. I didn't make the world, I just make keen observations as to its ignorance. "
1629,diyo11a,"I agree with your sentiments, however I wouldn't call it blatant sexism, in the overall religion perhaps, but in Australia you have the freedom to do as you please in that regard. You can't say Muslim women are *forced* to wear a burka/niqab/hijab in this country, that can only come from internal family/peer pressure, law can't enforce that. The repercussions are vastly different if a woman should choose not to/leave. That's a whole different issue though... Segregation is the issue, it just so happens to be Muslims are the focal point, which makes sense because the current issues we face with immigration is integration. You can be gay, straight, Muslim, or borg, just as long as we are advancing forward **together**. Some are a bit slow, so we wait. Some too fast, so they wait. Some go left, while others go right, if only to find a smoother path forward... But we are trying not to put divisions between us, especially while we are doing the exact same things! Of course the older generation are gonna talk shit either way, but putting up walls only shields the young on both sides, it's not a good symbol. "
1630,dizjgb3,"Wut? 

The comparison is adopting a symbol that is fundamentally in opposition to the cause. Not that Muslim women are nazis. The hijab is a symbol of oppression worn by women who are treated worse than animals and killed routinely for minor infractions against their faith. They are forced to wear it. It's disgusting. How anyone can find something good that it represents is beyond me. "
1631,djdet1k,Hijab is a sign of female oppression. Anyone who thinks otherwise is very ignorant of middle eastern history and culture. Most muslim women are not allowed to drive or even use the internet in majority Muslim countries where sharia law is in place. They would love nothing more than to cast off their hijabs forever and be equal to men. Meanwhile idiot Americans prance around in hijabs and pink pussy hats talking about women's rights. SMH
1632,djdlwc2,"oh really, so you're telling me there is implementation of sharia where muslim women are not obliged to wear hijab, and are not to be separated with men?"
1633,dgzrmyc,"Hey, as a woman, whenever I see a Muslim woman in a hijab, whether it covers their whole head or not, I think a lot of Muslim women are incredibly fashionable with their outfits, and put a lot of extra effort into their makeup and hair. I think all of you are exceptionally pretty and fashionable, but I do get intimidated from complimenting because I'm worried about making a cultural faux pas."
1634,dgzysai,"On International Workers' Day, marchers in Sweden take to streets to back Muslim women's right to wear hijabs at work.

1635,dh16q0w,"No because, like I said, there's no official statistics about it that I'm aware of. I'm just going off of what I have seen from living in the US and spending a summer in Germany. In the US, it's definitely only a small percentage. In Germany, most of the Muslim women are Turks and Iranians, and they usually don't wear hijab.

Edit: According to [this article](http://www.npr.org/2011/04/21/135523680/lifting-the-veil-muslim-women-explain-their-choice), 43% of Muslim women in the US wear some form of hijab. That's a bit higher than I thought, but it's still a minority and most of that 43% obviously isn't wearing a burqa/niqab."
1636,dh266b8,"&gt;the fact that there are Muslim people who freely do not wear a hijab shows that the hijab is not a core part of Islam at least in some modern interpretations. 

These interpretations are currently not freely adopted or even discussed in the muslim countries.  Hundreds of millions of muslim women are oppressed to different degrees everywhere-- more so in theocratic dictatorships. Homosexuals are persecuted. Etc etc."
1637,dh2p0xo,"&gt;For many Muslim women however, [...] they liberate themselves from these everyday pressures. They actually have the courage to say hey, I am not an object of pleasure, I am a woman that commands only respect for who I am and not how I look. They have the power to self-liberate as well as the courage to diverge from the American norms. And they do not get attention from showing off their figure, but they get attention by how they present themselves. Muslim woman get respect and are looked at beyond aesthetics; they are actually taken seriously in their communities.

&gt;Woman who wear hijab have freed themselves from a man’s and a society’s judgmental gaze; 

Wow, just... wow.

Holy shit, how disconnected can you be from reality to say headscarves are symbols of ""power"" and ""choice"". The author points out not ALL Muslim women are forced to wear it which is true, but given that the smashing majority Islamic countries do impose it, and also impose several other restrictions to women... Hmm, I'd like to see this lady move to Saudi Arabia and tell her sisters how empowered they are by diverging from the ""American"" norm . . . of having equal rights. 

"
1638,dh3az63,"In the US, many Muslim women are forced to wear a hijab by family. This is a fact that leftists refuse to believe."
1639,dh47tqw,"I study in an international university, I have met many Muslim women, I'm personally friends with a couple of them, and you would be surprised to know that I actually gathered my current opinion from them, because these Muslim women are, much like I learned to be, pretty irritated with the cultural glorification that has been going on with a piece of clothing that they themselves consider the kind of backwards practice that is holding their communities back.

*This* is what I'm advocating for. I'm not clamoring for the Hijab to be made illegal, but for the love of god let's not go around painting the damn thing with an American flag as a sign resistance or empowerment. *It doesn't help Muslim women*. Period."
1640,dh6zq9z,"No, hijab is actually the base case in mainstream Islam and across the vast majority of sects (Shia, Sunni, others). Technically speaking, non-hijabi Muslim women are not following the religion correctly. This is up to them of course and I defend their right to do so, but it is what it is. As for burqa and niqab: they are purely cultural in nature, as you mentioned. 

So no, hijab is not a ""symbol"", but rather a requirement from adherents of the religion. "
1641,dhaqo3t,"As a Muslim woman I'm disheartened by the discussions taking place in our community regarding women and hijab. It's so casual to criticize a hijab-wearing woman's way of wearing hijab. What's even more sad is that non hijab wearing Muslim women are excluded from the daily, casual criticism; and are not considered religious at all and for that reason are not scrutinized. We marginalize and judge our women based on their hijab with the highest criticism then get upset when non-Muslims criticize the hijab in general. IMHO that is hypocritical. Don't ask others not to judge something as you sit and judge hastily. On the other hand I'm excited to see the diversity of hijab today. Women in my generation are claiming the act of wearing hijab as their own and redefining it. There is a genuine sense of intention that I see blooming and it emphasizes the diversity that exists in the ummah. "
1642,dhbywts,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that the entire premise behind the hijab that Muslim women are forced to wear? Something about, if a man sees them, they'll be overcome by their urges and given to rape them? Or something to that effect. And now it's just mainstream accepted. "
1643,dhfjd44,"I guess. It's just, to me, a lot of Muslim women are saying they choose the hijab. Maybe they're brain washed into wearing it, maybe you're brain washed into thinking it's okay for someone to cut the tip of you dick off without your consent. Who really knows for sure..."
1644,dhhhflp,"Let me put it this way...

&gt;Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab...
&gt;""But Im a Muslim women and I have never met another Muslim women forced to wear the hijab""...
&gt;Okay...but they are still forced to wear it based on this provided evidence...
&gt;""Well im a Muslim woman, and I have never met another Muslim woman who was forced to wear the hijab""...

I think y'all are uhh...missing the fucking point. "
1645,dhile48,"Women **are not** exempt from criticism, especially regarding their looks. Like, every fucking day, I see so many articles/opinions about how *these muslim women are oppressing themselves by wearing hijab* **and also** *these women need to put some clothes on! Leggings are not pants! If I can see your cleavage don't be offended if I look at it!*

"
1646,dhrhc1c,"Because a lot of Muslim women are actually not oppressed. There are 1.8 billion Muslims living all over the world &amp; within that huge population there are all shades of Muslims, from ISIS to ISIS sympathisers to relatively conservative to various degrees of liberal and a lot of even non-practicing Muslims. A lot of Muslim women dress, work, travel and do whatever they want with little to no difference to non-Muslims. For example, a woman doesn't have to wear a Hijab to be Muslim, of course a lot of conservative families force their girls to wear Hijab, but many give them the choice. The reason you only​ hear about cases of oppressed Muslim women is because ""A normal lady living a normal life with a normal family"" is not really news, so there is nothing to report there. "
1647,dhsed0a,All a hijab is a head scarf. Many Muslim women who choose to wear headscarves do it as fashion rather then being forced to. To assume that all Muslim women are forced to wear a hijab in my opinion is a racist stereotype
1648,dhw43dg,"No, not really. The kippah is not designed to conceal or for ""modesty"" (treating women like cattle who are only for their husbands eyes), it's simply a sign of faith and one that is almost always very flexible in requirements (most Jews only wear it for prayer or at the synagogue). It's also not selective for one gender, Jewish women have similar practices of head covering during prayer.

What I dislike about the hijab is that it's:

A) Only for women frequently, so many Muslim women are pressured or forced to wear all sorts of modest clothing while their men walk around in kakhis smoking and even drinking despite it being haram. At least the Saudi's aren't as hypocritical and impose similar modesty customs on their men, but the men still frequently have lots of wiggleroom and choice the women do not.

B) Oppressive. The hijab is frequently pushed on Muslim women under the claim that all men are basically pigs and can't help but stare and sexualize an uncovered woman, and some are even convinced it protects them from rape. Perhaps in their home countries it serves this purpose disgustingly, but in the west I prefer our ideals that such behavior is completely unacceptable and thus women can walk freely like men.

C) Most Muslim women will deny this if asked directly, but they are frequently pressured or forced into wearing it. Best case scenario a conservative family might disown or shame a daughter for not wearing it, worst case they beat her and force her to. This is not rare, and many Ex-Muslim women have spoken of this, particularly in Muslim countries where their society enables violence and discrimination against women."
1649,dhwlndx,"If you think that my wife or 99.9999999999% of Muslim women are forced to wear hijab, you're a fool. You know very well that isn't true, but because of your own bigotry it's impossible for you to assign agency to women and telling yourself that Muslim women are forced to wear hijab and *really* want nothing more than to dress like oh-so-superior westerners makes you feel a bit more justified in being a racist and verbally harassing Muslim women doesn't it?


Sick."
1650,di33koo,"Muslim women are not obliged to wear the hijab at all, as there is no compulsion in religion. The girl wearing a hijab was most likely (I'm speculating) her choice, or parental/societal pressure, could have been anything. But yes, most Muslim girls wear the hijab when reaching adolescence/maturity because it can be considered their choice then. And yes, I know someone will reply to this trying to convince me this is all wrong. "
1651,di36aat,"&gt; Muslim women are not obliged to wear the hijab at all

Depends on sect/region. Saudi Arabia, Iraq &amp; Iran have laws requiring them in public... Quite a few other places have informal laws requiring the hijab or moderate dress.

&gt;  no compulsion in religion.

1655,fyd03cb,I explained to my wife how a lot of people who are anti mask were conditioned to think this way because of anti Islam propaganda. Their whole idea of masks being oppressive is because the conversations most conservatives have had regarding face coverings in the last 20 years have been that Muslim women are oppressed because some Muslim countries require women to wear hijabs whether they want to or not.
1656,fzbfzdb,That all brown muslim women are oppressed .
1657,fzn4bjj,"This is another misconception. Nine out of ten times, no one is forcing them to do anything. Sure, there are laws and regulations, just like some western countries have about some clothing items. And what's wrong with religious clothing? Burqas and the uniforms that nuns wear (habit? Sorry I don't know the proper name) are extremely similar. I don't see anyone getting outraged about how the nuns are being oppressed. If muslim women are being oppressed because their religion tells them to cover their bodies, then nuns are oppressed too, right, and that religious clothing should be banned? 

There are lots of cultures where women dress modestly and yet only Muslim women are shamed for it. 

And, western countries make western Muslim women remove their burqas. This incident speaks for itself - https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/french-police-make-woman-remove-burkini-on-nice-beach

If anyone should seem articulate, empathetic and fair it should be the exmuslim community, but it always seems to turn into low effort muslim bashing."

1662,g0b3pki,"As I understand it, Muslim women are in general not oppressed, but in muslim countries there is a problem with rape culture. For example, in the UAE, without four witnesses to attest that a woman was raped, she will be punished for adultery and therefore rapes without four witnesses are unreported. There is also a big scandal in Egypt at the moment about rape."
1663,g0su3lk,"What do want? For people to just say 'Oh I'm so blind! I shall turn my back on Islam forever!' because you tell them its bad. That isnt how this sort of thing works. I'm agnostic myself, so I believe that a persons right to believe in what they want to believe in is their perogative. Shouting and raving about women's rights is not going to change that and being disrespectful to people who challenge your opinions really isn't giving your argument much ground. You have to know that not all Muslim women are oppressed. Yes some are and that's awful but this isn't the case for all Muslim women.

Religion, as an abstract ideology, should never merit placement on a pedestal. Religious freedoms should never inhibit equal human rights between all humans, irrespective of religious belief. There has to be a foundational level of recognised protection for ALL people. A gay Muslim may even believe he deserves to be thrown off a building in accordance with his cultural practises. Does that make it okay for you to suggest that he be supported and afforded this ‘freedom’? 

Muslim women who claim they have the choice to wear the niqab are setting a dangerously insidious message that all Muslim women are afforded a choice. They aren’t. You said that “there are many Muslim women who claim to wear it of their own accord”, yet this is not a quantifiable or measurable statistic, especially when it is known that Islamic women are already existing in cultures and social circles that deny them freedom of expression, speech, and mere public presence. This oppression is not always visible, and filters down into even some of the most progressive Islamic societies — most immigrant Muslim women tend to live in Islamic cultural communities within western countries, and are similarly subjected to these facial-covering laws by familial and social force, if not by theocratic enforced law.

More importantly, the fact that this “choice” is solely forced upon WOMENKIND is indicative enough of an unwelcome inequality. If Islamic and Middle Eastern men wore similar facial coverings, this would not be an issue; facial coverings would be an accepted egalitarian facet of Islamic culture. But they do not, because theocratic Islamic societies — and the subsequent global communities that they form — have always prioritised the male sex‘s superiority. Ask yourself, if choice of emancipation is handed to the oppressed, yet they must continue to live with, marry, and coexist with their oppressors, would the oppressed ever take such a risk? Probably not. Thus, just because the ‘choice’ exists, the fair and appropriate grounds for choice-making most certainly do not. This is why Muslim women are not empowered by the burka, or the supposed ‘choice’ of wearing one. The choice, for these women, does not exist, even if they claim it does; it is rather an illusion of choice, and one that is perpetuated by more privileged Islamic women. Furthermore, if these women believe that the choice does exist, why do they not question why this choice is solely presented to them, and not their husbands, brothers, and fathers? 

I’ll tell them why: socially ingrained systemic misogyny. 

A number of women being upset about a law does not strictly make this law anti-feminist or misogynist. These laws are designed to protect all women, not cater to the religious expectations set upon certain women. The majority of these women who are upset are more probably upset at the repercussions of their cultural disobedience, rather than the cultural disobedience itself. Thus, not only should a ban be implemented, but further assurance of protection for these Muslim women need to be encouraged too. 

Oppression only works — and flourishes —when the oppressed truly believe that they are not oppressed. This is what we are dealing with here. If banning the burqa is religious discrimination, it is in the name of human liberation. The burqa, whether supported by certain women or not, is a tool of patriarchally-enforced misogyny. It has no place, not just in Europe, but in the world as a whole."

Yes, muslim hurt people.

When Muslim women are constantly portrayed as oppressed for having to wear burqa’s it dehumanizes them and fails to display the diversity that exists within them. To the religious authority point, the complete face covering or niqaab is a particular interpretation of Islam and not a strict requirement of the religion. So when western media so often paints Muslim women as having little to no agency in what they wear, it is not displaying them in a fair way and actually does them a disservice! There are a multitude of Muslim countries in the world, with a wide variety of cultures that all have different customs, and not all of them are oppressive, they have issues to the same extent the west does."

My fiancee got lower grades in school than all the girls because ""the time of men has passed and it's  girls world now"" wtf?? 
Sure feminists want it to be okay to not have children but if you're  a ""traditional woman"" like me (i.e. wanting a child wanting to be a stay at home mom) then all of the sudden youre being ""oppressed"" 

It's not just that, it's also the whole thing with feminists liking muslims which I also can't wrap my head around. Their faith is so misogynist toward women and muslim women are actually being opressed but for some reason we love it. 

Feminism does not equal equality. The world won't get better until we start judging people based on their merits. Not skin colour, not gender, not sexual orientation.

Like it's totally illogical to say American women shouldn't complain when they're sexually assaulted because Muslim women have it worse, that doesn't even make any sense. The original thing that sparked it wasn't even a woman saying she'd been harassed or assaulted, but just a woman who basically said ""hey just so you guys know it can actually make women really uncomfortable when they're alone in the middle of the night and a total stranger hits on them, so maybe don't do that"" and Dawkins responded like ""omg how can you say that when Muslim women aren't allowed to drive."" So I guess no one is allowed to feel uncomfortable about anything as long as Muslim women are oppressed? That's totally nonsensical. And then later he said he didn't like how American women complained about being ""inappropriately touched"" in the workplace  because Muslim women experience more severe oppression. So people just shouldn't care if they're getting sexually assaulted at work because other people elsewhere have it worse? That makes absolutely no sense. 

But I guess a lot of religious people are like that too, like they may be really smart in one subject yet then totally irrational when it comes to religion. Like some of them can be brilliant scientists yet still believe there's an invisible sky wizard secretly controlling everything.

1734,f20wj85,"&gt; **With the RSS finally acknowledging that Christian women in India are better off, it should re-calibrate its stand on conversion and anti-conversion laws.**

&gt; It was a pleasant surprise last week to come across a news report about the findings of a survey done by what was described as a ‘RSS think tank’ on the status of women in India. Besides claiming that married women and women who seek spiritual help are happier than others, it also acknowledged that employment was found to be highest among Christian women, followed by Hindus, Muslims and Jains.

&gt; ... In India, most Christians are Dalits and Adivasis. Studies have also shown that most conversions to Christianity are initiated by women who want better education and better lives for their children.

&gt; It is remarkable, therefore, to find an admission that these Dalit/Adivasi women converted to Christianity are today better educated and better employed. These communities may not boast of as much wealth, land, property or capital, they appear to be leading lives that are better and more comfortable. Their congregations are also collectives that promote cooperation and distribution. The available resource distribution among Christian community is higher than in other communities. They are a collective, national resource.

&gt; The question is why then does the RSS oppose conversions to Christianity? Why doesn’t it accept religious freedom and people’s right to choose a faith of their choice? If one accepts the narrative that most Christians were converted forcibly, how does one explain better education and better employment among them, as even the RSS seems to admit now?

&gt; **The question to ask is why Hindu and Muslim women are more backward and why Christian women are more advanced in terms of education and employment despite being historically the most oppressed in caste terms?**

1737,eytoy0m,"&gt;Claiming all Muslim women are brainwashed/without agency

Never said all. But yes many are, it simply isn't possible to make good decisions without exposure to information.

I even provided an easy metric to measure how many. You compare the amount of women who definitely have freedom in a western Nation who decide to wear these stupid things to the amount of women and obviously oppressed nations or and families who just recently emigrated from such a shitty cultures.

For example that congresswoman talib whatever from the rust belt, she clearly has freedom to choose. An oppressive Islamic husband or father would never stand where politically active wife or daughter. And there is a nonzero a trivial a small amount of white women who have clearly never lived in Islamic culture yet choose to wear these things. But this is such an insignificant percent of the population you rounded it away, I can't say you're entirely wrong.

&gt;It's definitely a delicate issue, and I honestly don't know how best to solve it.

This is why I haven't proposed banning them. I know it's not right to leave them on that's also wrong to take them off.

If we could trust our government to do anything not stupid I would propose a one generation long ban somehow. This would ""harm"" women who actually have agency and choose to wear them and that is unfortunate, but it would likely actually save lives by exposing men who would be wife beaters and abusive when they attempt to enforce shitty headgear wearing despite the law. It seems to me this is obviously the path that best minimizes harm if we had a government that could actually enforce it and not turned into a way to disenfranchise voters or systematically arrest brown people."

Truly, Islam is literally the worst system for women in the world. Every society is misogynistic but Islam really outdoes itself. Leftists think that accepting Islamic misogyny makes them less racist but it actually makes them more racist because they hold Muslim males to a lower standard than white males, believing them to be backwards and that Muslim women are happy being oppressed. 

Truly, female liberation requires dismantling the Islamic patriarchy as much as it requires dismantling Western patriarchy."
1750,evcp47v,"No strawman at all. Progressives do tend to view things as oppressor/oppressed, but that doesn't justify ignoring ""problematic"" cultural elements in minority cultures, because the people inside these cultures are still subject to the power of that culture. Young Muslim women are subject to the power of their fathers and husbands.

The obsession about multiculturalism and cultural diversity on the other hand does provide an explanation that is consistent with people's claimed principles and positions.

&gt;You realize that almost everyone in the Islamic world believes that western women are oppressed.

No, many think that western women are libertine whores that it's fine to sexually assault.

&gt;And that almost everyone in the western world believes that Islamic women are oppressed

I'll suggest that it has to do with the fact that Sharia Law oppresses women.  You don't see a lot of Western women covered head to toe in clothing.

&gt; You never hear “we need to liberate them because of how they mistreat their men”. 

Who?  Who do we need to liberate because men are mistreated?

You don't hear us saying, ""We should liberate them because they mistreat women"" either.

Seems to me you're the only reasonable person in the bunch.

While many Muslim women are free thinking, and allowed to make their own choices, the fact is that some too, are oppressed by their spouses and families within their religion.

(Off topic, but must be stated: Lets keep in mind though, the same argument can be made for almost every modern religion in practice. Equality needs work in every corner of the earth to varying degrees.)

Your friend should be able to recognize this, as it is a fact, however you will need to work with her on understanding that you were not at all targeting her, nor had any intention for the essay to be about her or her relationship in any way. You need to make it clear to her that your ex is the one who decided to make the essay about her after it was written.

You don't need anyone in your life who will purposely meddle with, and ruin your friendships. Especially based on his complete dishonesty about the situation to do so (not to mention the blatent bigotry).

1762,eo82opa,"It’s absolutely okay for anyone to criticize men of colour for their misogyny. 

You seem to be saying that white women should only be allowed to criticize white men and I say a big fat no to that. We have to criticize men of colour. If we can’t, then how can we call out sexism perpetrated by men of colour towards women of colour and white women? 

Someone’s race does not protect them from criticism of misogyny. Being a racial minority is not an excuse to be misogynistic.

Fuck men of colour. They collaborate on misogyny with white men. 

If you say white eomen can’t criticize men of colour, then how are we supposed to stand up for ourselves if we’re in a relationship with a man of colour and he’s misogynistic? I have been in that position. Every disagreement he’d be like “well you’re a white oppressor” and he sexually fetishized my skin colour and seemed to think having sex with me meant he was conquering the white man. There are men of colour who suck you know. They aren’t all noble, long suffering warriors who, given a chance, and no interference from the white man, would implement a society where women are equal. 

Grow up. Men of colour are still men.

I have yet to see a post on here where men of colour are vilified for anything but their misogyny. 

White women do not have to bow down to men of colour. Their oppression is not more important than our oppression. It’s just a different form of oppression. If you say racial oppression is worse than oppression of women, then how can you possibly be supportive of women of colour? So you’re willing to end the racism they experience from white people but not the sexism they experience at the hand of men of their own culture because men of colour are victims of white people. NO! There has to be a simultaneous effort to end both sexism and racism. 

Seriously, the police excused my ex because he was racially oppressed. Telling white women to give passes to men of colour for their misogyny just makes it more likely that they will victimize us too or collaborate with white men on our victimization. In fact, failure to call out men of colour for misogyny in their cultures is tantamount to allying with them in their oppression of women of colour. 

As a woman, when I evaluate the behaviour of a man of colour, all I have to do is think about whether I would find it acceptable to be treated in the same way. 

That’s all you have to do. Ask yourself “would I like to be forced into domestic servitude and have to wear a clothing that covers my whole body? Would I want to be the topic of dehumanizing song lyrics and portrayed on screen as hypersexual? Would I be okay with my spouse having several other spouses? Would I be okay with being left out of decision-making in society?”

You may notice that all those scenarios are not unique to women of colour but when we only call out white men for being sexist we are minimizing and ignoring the same experiences of women of colour. The way women of colour are portrayed by men in their culture influences how they’re portrayed by white people too...

For example, Muslim women are portrayed as obedient and meek by Muslim men or as “Westernized” whores. How can we stop Muslim men from victimizing women who become too Westernized unless we call them out and say “no, you cannot force your daughter to wear what you want her to wear. She is not a slut for wearing her hair down or for talking to boys. It doesn’t matter that you’re Muslim, women have the right to choose whether or not to follow a religion.”

Sick of people who say “that’s just their culture.” No, the women do not like being subjugated. There are handmaidens of the patriarchy in every culture but just because some women want to wear Hijabs and let their men be their guardians  doesn’t mean that all women born into Muslim families should have to live that way. 

Then you have to look at the choices women of colour are given far too often: be a handmaiden of the patriarchy and achieve a place in the patriarchy or face being ostracized by your family and friends, and even killed. 

Men who aren’t from Western societies are far more misogynistic than white, Western men, so why are you trying to stop us from calling out the worst misogyny on the planet?

If you want to end patriarchy, criticizing men of colour is inevitable."
1763,eob6689,"Christianity is against gay people too, but people only remember Islam being against it because it is willing to enforce strict measures to ensure there are no rule-breakers. 

I still don't genuinely understand why the West thinks Muslim women are oppressed. Some claim it's because of the headscarf.  But wearing the headscarf is just another rule in Islam. If you see a Muslim woman wearing a headscarf, there's a 99% chance that she understands why she has to wear it and how she benefits from it. The other 1% that feels that they're being oppressed doesn't understand the religion and should try to educate themselves or leave the religion altogether.

1780,emvq0zc,"I disagree. Western feminism has been partially about removing the taboo around the naked female body, which is why the choice to wear a bikini is a more feminist choice. Also, the bikini is not the only bathing suit choice of Western women. We are not required to wear a bikini while these Muslim women have no choice but the burkini. We can wear shorts, tankinis, full piece suits, bathing suits that look like dresses and we could even wear a burkini if we wanted to. That’s why the Western portrayal of bathing suits are symbolic of liberation because they allow for female nudity. We don’t have to cover up for fear of being considered whores while swimming but in reality we don’t have to wear that sort of revealing swimsuit if we don’t want to.  We have choice, this isn’t a burkini versus bikini debate and to reduce it to such is to wrongfully claim that Western misogyny has just as much of a negative effect on Western women as Islamic misogyny does on Muslim women. Indeed, that isn’t the truth but it’s one thing Islamists say to try to deflect criticism of Islam. In reality, Western women have hordes of freedoms Muslim women just don’t have. Islam is the worst ideological system for women that’s ever existed in the world. We are not oppressed by the bikini in the same way Muslim women are oppressed by the burkini. If you don’t like bikinis then pick something else to swim in. No one is forcing you into a bikini."

1787,ejikj4n,"I didn't see what you said in the section you linked; did you mean to link another section? The worst I found there is this:

&gt;Muslim women are uniquely vulnerable to sexism and Islamophobia, and the subsequent denial from Islamophobes that criticism against them is sexist or Islamophobic. Muslim women are visible targets for harassment when they wear headscarves and are also often subjected to negative stereotypes and forced to respond to misconceptions that they are oppressed and silenced by their religion. The Islamophobes pretend that they are ""liberating"" women by advocating for bans on headscarves or ""burkinis"".

The second sentence is stupid but they clearly just took some Western hijabi's word for it. There's no mention of ""sexism"" and the rest of the article seems fine. The RationalWiki article on the burka starts with the wonderful quote and response:

&gt;*My mother used to wear a burqa with a net over her face. It reminded me of the meat safes in my grandmother’s house. Meat safe’s net was made of metal, my mother’s net was made of linen. But the objective was the same: keeping the meat safe.*  —Taslima Nasreen, likening women to meat whilst dismissing rumours that Islam is in any way misogynistic 

The rest of the article is non-confrontational and mostly an interesting, if amateur, look at the history of the dress - one which assumes a secular view of Islam's origins. I don't think we can condemn RationalWiki just for this.

RationalWiki hosts numerous good articles debunking common theist arguments, such as the teleological argument, the argument from design, fine tuning, claims against evolution, etc, and these are valuable resources to us."

Many people believe that Muslim women only wear hijabs because they're forced to by their fathers and husbands, and it's rarely their own choice. When there's such a strong narrative that removes agency from Muslim women, it's not a surprise that it's suddenly not their fault for joining ISIS."

Muslim women are being oppressed in countries but you can’t say all muslim women or that it’s the fault of Islam, if Islam was being followed correctly it wouldn’t happen. They use the fear of God to force their children or women even to listen to them and unfortunately many kids are educated on religion by their parents but don’t educate themselves, the parents make up the rules and say it’s religion, the children suffer."
1792,ekv5gur," &gt; Muslim women are perfectly capable and more informed to do that themselves, and I’d be more interested in hearing their perspective if and when it affects them.

Except for the part that sex-based oppression is largely naturalized to the point most women have internalized misogyny (whose form is shaped by other cultural factors as well) and are incapable of recognizing the extent to which they're oppressed, and other women with differing life experiences who haven't been drenched specifically in that flavor and manifestation of it can actually have a surprisingly accurate and impartial take on it. 

And I do believe this goes both ways; I've encountered Muslim or ex-Muslim women expressing the sentiment that Western women are oppressed by beauty and ""sexiness"" standards far more than they realize, and I recognize this as a very relevant and worthwhile perspective to share. As long as women are coming from the position of wanting to protect their own and each others' interests, I don't see why some perspectives should be censored based on factors that have little to do with what's being discussed in the first place -- sex-based oppression."

Honestly with how Muslim women are mistreated, with places like Pakistan and the middle East being the WORST places in the world for a woman to exist it makes Muslim men look like FOOLS to be trash talking the one movement that is focused on helping and supporting oppressed women.

Now your point is **Muslim women are oppressed - this dress code is a sign of their oppression **. 

I agree that some Muslim women are oppressed.  But you can’t take it as axiomatic that a particular style of swimwear is a sign of oppression, any more than me wearing shorts on the beach is a sign of oppression. I work and am friends with quite a few Muslim women, who wear headscarves because it’s what they feel comfortable in and it’s tradition (and it apparently a great hands-free mobile holder). They aren’t particularly oppressed under any useful measure, but they might have chosen to wear something like this to the beach - I don’t know. 

It’s important to concentrate on combating *actual* oppression, rather than taking someone’s dress code at face value. "
1816,ec04aj9,"&gt;ya but you think it is her choice?

Yes.  At least the ones who I know personally.  You can't just assume every Muslim woman or most Muslim women are oppressed.

Edit: again, talking about the West.  Obviously the Middle East is different."
1817,e874su2,"Well, I was more saying that to stave off the very common sentiment of ""Muslim women are forced to cover their faces and hair, therefore they're oppressed and *need* to be ""liberated"" by the West"" that's been repeated a million times already. I've seen it derail a lot of discussions because it's a very very common way to couch islamophobia in the facade of being egalitarian. To get your point across on this website you need to deflect all of the knee jerk meme reactions from reactionaries. "
1818,e8d53f3,What about the majority of Muslim women who do choose to wear it? Assumming all Muslim women are oppressed and islam forces it on them is more than a bit much.
1819,e8sr5jh,Really? How can you not see a correlation? Are you female? Muslim women are deeply oppressed sexually! We are given countless examples of how our bodies are dirty and you don’t think this seeps deep into our subconscious? This isn’t helpful at all.
1820,e8srxok,"Dunno where u live,apparently a very rural place in the 3rd world, Muslim women are not oppressed in big cities and they know exactly how to manipulate men

1821,e8tbw3c,So they’re admitting that Muslim women are so oppressed by that religion/culture they can’t stand up for themselves?  Thank goodness a misguided and nosey SJW is there to save the day!
1822,e910f99,"Tbf that article says that Muslim WOMEN are truly feminists, not that ISLAMISM is feminist. Which is quite true: as one of the most oppressed class in society, they strive a lot to fight for their rights. "
1823,e94udl2,"1. English-speaking Muslims exist (who only speak bits of Arabic that are special to Islam),     
2. Arabic-speaking countries are not the only places where people practice Islam (going back many centuries)       
3. US-born Muslims exist (where English is the main/only language), even going back many many generations      
3. Women are oppressed in English-speaking countries           
4. I highly doubt this poster is specifically anti-niqab, 2012 as now Muslim women are attacked from all sides; Eastern world for still strong chauvinism, Western rightists for obvious reasons, Western leftists seeing them as 'willing victims', the list goes on. The point is they used a visibly (eg, niqab'd) Muslim woman as she was the face of the struggle at the time.     
     
This is as silly as asking why any posters with crucifix-necklaced white woman aren't in Latin"
1824,e976te2,"Doesn't sound intrinsically intrusive at all. But some Muslim women are very proud of their culture and some are very oppressed by it -- at both ends of the spectrum politics is advisable, just for community relations.

I'm imagining a situation wherein you (the community program) is attempting to engage Muslim women in physical activity? I know that sounds hella narrow, but I know things like that are things that are. Title IX's applicability to athletics (however strained the relationship between walking for health and a university athletics department might be) can be rather narrow as well and so that's something I'm going to specifically bring up once this bastard friend of mine gets back from whatever Happy Hour she's managed to locate this evening.

1827,e98iwbl,"Yeah. Pretty much that. As far as I can see, hindu, christian or muslim, women are oppressed in many of the same ways. The uber-conservative culture is also problematic from the pov of women’s rights. "

1829,e4wde8p,"There ARE 'world statistics' sources, that confirm the percentage of atheism is growing throughout the entire world.

Its certainly not just the Christian nation US that are finally becoming 'no religion'.  
You even cited another one. China is 50% non religious? Wow a few centuries ago they were supernatural religious mad (ALL of them). The percentages of non-religious or atheist is exponentially growing bigger each year. Actually non-religious NOW out number Jews in the US.

1830,e6o0qbv,"Which women are those? Non-Muslim women are already not oppressed by Muslims in this country. If it is Muslim women you mean, in this country, if they don’t want to wear the veil, they already have the right to choose not to wear it. If they are marching in the streets, I can only presume they are already not wearing the veil..."
1831,e743i1b,"To be fair, the action is literally targeted towards all religions. Could be due to the fact that populations as a whole are moving away from religion in general.

Personally, I'm fine with people believing in whatever they want, but when it comes to security, that's a whole different story. When people can't be identified and are not willing to reveal there faces, I take issue with that. Security supercedes your beliefs (although this case doesn't seem to be about security).

I'm also against oppression (I know it's a strong stance), and many muslim women are suffering because of it. Of course not all of them feel as if they are being oppressed, but that's the core of it.

Edit: just so I'm clear, I'm against banning religious items from being worn. If we have freedom of religion in this country, they should be free to wear them EXCEPT when security is at risk."
1832,e7etab0,"I think that the person making that argument has a good point, but isn't making it well. 

The culture in which you are raised certainly has a large affect on your thoughts and ideas as an adult. 

Now, does that mean you get a pass on being close minded and bigoted? No. But it should be considered when judging if a person is ""scum"" or not. 

For example, I know many people who think that Muslim women are oppressed because they are required to wear head scarves (Muslim men are also required to dress modestly, but it's a man's world so...). But, I've had Muslim women tell me that it feels liberating as they are judged by their character, not their appearance. 

Our different cultures are what drives those opinions. Polygamy is frowned on in ""the West"" but is very common among tribal communities as it means more kids who as a bonus have a stable father figure in their lives. 

Again though, if evidence shows up saying that a believe is wrong or it inheriently leads to someone being hurt, such as racism or sexism or some type of phobia, then yeah, it's completely reasonable to expect a person to change their ideas and behavior. 

I forget which philosopher said it, but he argued that culture plays such a strong part in who you are and your ideas that the only truly original idea you can have outside of it is to choose to die."
1833,e7wlh1z,"Let me put it this way, Muslim women are the only race of women on the planet that can legitimately be considered ""oppressed"". All other forms of patriarchy benefit women and give them a higher quality of life than men. 

East Asian patriarchy, specifically in Japan, is probably the most pro-female version of patriarchy there is. Many Japanese women prefer it over ""liberation"". With that being said, they experience extreme sexism in the workforce and tons of sexual harassment so maybe it balances out. "
1834,e4sbk0w,"&gt; No, I asked if you are justifying honour killings

No? How on earth did you came to that conclusion? You said ""honor killings are justified in the Qur'an"", and provided a verse. I pointed out that the verse didn't talk anything about killing anyone at all. I further pointed out if honor killings are actually mandated in the Scriptures, then there would not be a disparity of treatment on the issue across the globe.

Let me outline how this travesty of a conversation came about.

1. You: ""we should ban head coverings to free Muslim women""

2. Me: ""no, that's a horrible thing. If you care about Muslim women you will want to create an environment where they can freely choose what they want, rather than forcing them like their oppressive menfolk""

3. You: ""no, all Muslim women are oppressed and can't make decision by themselves"" &lt;--- this is where things are starting to get stupid

4. Me: ""that's ridiculous. Muslim women, like any others, have their own agency. Some freely choose to don the scarf for their reasons. Why not respect that?""

______________

I am not an expert in Qur'anic interpretation (there are actual university degrees for that), but it's clear that you know even less than I am. How about you not quote that to support your arguments? ""We need to take away the freedom of Muslim women (to wear headscarves) in order to give them freedom"" - you can justify that secularly, without trying to quote the Qur'an."
1835,e5y0cjr,And they say Muslim women are oppressed. Trust me those women in burkha.. You don't wana mess with them. Specially in middle east.
1836,dyojcxy,arab girls are our only option and there's a reason why we keep them oppressed as much as possible
1837,e2vz4za,"Racial privilege exists...however white women and Asian women both are nowhere near oppressed in the U.S.

Asian women are oppressed in other countries, but not by white men...Muslim women are oppressed in other countries,  but not by white men.

Racial privilege has nothing to do with interracial relationships.  I think you need to post on another board possibly..this is about relationships.

Honestly..I still think you're lying and you're a borderline troll from the r/hapa board.

Some of your viewpoints seem very similar to theirs...but it's like you're trying to get out of admitting it."
1838,e34tnpz,"&gt; if I say something negative about Muslims or Jewish religion.

It depends what you say. A lot of people say discriminatory things like ""muslim women are violently oppressed and subjected to sex slavery."" That's not discriminatory because you're talking about muslims, that's discriminatory because you're generalizing a negative stigma (sterotype) to a large number of people based on a pseudo-inherent trait. 

In other words, if you stereotype any large group of people by the worst attributes of a subset of that group, you're being discriminatory. It has nothing to do with race vs. religion. "
1839,e38a3mw,"&gt;It's not right, it's not Islamic and it's sick as hell.

Last time i checked, people that werent Muslims in Mohammads time had to pay taxes just to not be killed like animals and were called in the Quran like vermin. So i would say it is Islamic.

&gt;The tenets of a religion can't be judged by its followers
&gt;Does that mean they're good Christians

The first one i absolutely agree. The catholic church for example tainted the name of Christianity, but it still doesnt mean it were Christian acts. And the people that do so, arent Christians. You could say ""No true Scotsman fallacy"" and such, but then at the same time, is someone who calls himself a vegetarian, but doesnt keep the values and still eats meat a vegetarian? Or would it be ""No true Scotsman"" all over again?

Sad part is, the Quran and its accompanying books are contradictory on several occasions and did either ignore violence against women, with the prophet himself telling a beaten wife to go back to her husband, Aisha saying that muslim women are terribly treated and such.

I wont use ISIS, or acid attacks or any of that to dispel Islam as a religion of peace. But i will use its scripture and the acts of its Prophet himself as a mean to argue and criticize it. And i will especially use the Bible aswell, which isnt necessary, but it most certainly works towards the point.

I mean, even if you want to argue about it, theres strong evidence that Mohammad fucked a 9 y old. And even without it, he had several wives, which the Gospel and Torah clearly condemned, which also came from Allah according to the Quran. He also oppressed as i said, infidels under Muslim rule. They were clearly oppressed and were demonized in the Quran.

Tl;Dr:

Islam tends to oppress people, the Prophet of Islam was most likely a childrapist, but definetly a warmonger and wifebeater. I dont use ISIS, but scripture and the prophet to criticize Islam."
1840,e3gellv,"I don’t get it. You’re pointing out Muslim women are oppressed, especially in Saudi Arabia?"
1841,e3l8i9i,Its called standing up for oppressed people. Which Muslim women are.
1842,e3qowp8,"Muslim women are among the MOST oppressed women. It's important that they, more than many other women, have access to abortion for unwanted pregnancy.

Especially since rape is so normalized in Islam."
1843,e3tikep,"Two points:

1.

All of this is irrelevant if the person is choosing to wear it. I also find goth outfits creepy but it’s not my business. There was also a time when some nasty ppl found dreadlocks ‘hideous’ and ‘dirty.’

If people are being forced to do things against their will, then there are domestic violence laws that cover that. People are free until proven otherwise...to assume as a default that Muslim women are ‘forced’ is to basically be Islamophobic by pushing shoddy stereotypes about Muslims (my wife wears the Niqab - I don’t need to tell you it’s her choice because that should be the default and I shouldn’t need to give disclaimers each time, it’s utterly insulting).

2.

Then there’s this other angle which is going to need ppl to think beyond their boxes a little. 

Everyone has their own definition of what constitutes their private body. To a nudist, the average women being expected to wear any top in summer is ‘oppression.’ But those women are free to define that their bosom/torso area is their private body they want to cover. In other times, societal norms made it so women covered more. These change with time and place. 

Some Muslim women likewise choose to cover their private bodies but their definition of what it constitutes is wider than just bosom and crotch. They’re free to define this for themselves - be that through religious interpretation or otherwise. Totally absurd to find non-Muslims suddenly preaching to Muslim women what scriptural interpretation to follow. 

Most of this rhetoric - once you peel it away - isn’t about people concerned about Muslim women but a cover for removing from society something people simply don’t want to see because they dislike it. And there are many names for this form of mob policing of minorities.

—

EDIT:

All 3 responses are making the same assumption that Muslim women in the U.K. are oppressed and forced to wear the Niqab. A few things:

-	If you’re claiming that there’s a specific significant problem within wider domestic violence of Muslim women being forced into clothes, then you have to provide more than say ‘it’s well known.’ And don’t bring some case from Iran or Afghanistan as ‘evidence’ or even an article from here and there as evidence. You can find sporadic cases of almost anything. We’re talking about the rights of British women here, and British MPs and public figures talking of banning their clothing. Without evidence, it’s simply bigotry and cheap stereotypes. Like saying “It’s well known black youth are thugs.” Only ‘well known’ amongst racist types, yes. 

-	And even then, look at the disproportionality. 1 in 10 women are affected by domestic violence in the U.K. and somehow we’re *obsessively* talking about a &lt;0.01% minority (Niqabi women) within a minority (practicing Muslims) within a minority (Muslims in general). And then a further minority of them who - it’s being claimed - are forced against their wishes. And we have, every 6 months, a national debate about it and laws being proposed to police them. All apparently for their well being when, in reality, if you really cared for the well being of Niqabi Muslim women (like my wife), you’d listen to them and stop demonising them on this colossal level. This orchestrated campaign is nothing short of nasty politics at play."
1844,e3yyar9,What's your point? Are you denying that millions of Muslim women are oppressed around the world everyday? 
1845,e416trl,"Except everyone pointed out that 

Hospital Treatment is because the conservatives cut bed numbers and the social network forcing A&amp;E and hospitals to become social beds. One of my old beds was around 1500 a night. It's cheaper to put people up in a 5 star hotel and come see them every day for some of the stuff we kept in because it was unethical to discharge them. No medical person who wants to help would send these people out. You want hospital care? FUCKING PAY THE PIPER. Don't fuck about blaming immigrants. Blame your stupid voting practices for austerity. To be paid the same as my role was paid in 2004 I would need a 30% pay hike to my take home salary. 30%! That's how fucking bad it is. Why do you think everyone's fucking angry on the NHS? Don't see MPs taking a 30% pay cut. Don't see houses being 30% cheaper. Cost of living's not 30% lower. So we lose staff. Fuck! Child care is so expensive that if you have 2 kids then ""don't work"" is a sensible option if you are a DOCTOR. A CMT makes less than 20 quid an hour, child care's 10 quid an hour for a kid. Why would you work? It costs you to work. Guess what? Conservatives cut the creche budget that gave us cheaper child care which meant the MOSTLY female medical system would simply drop out to play house instead of working. Cut after cut after cut hit us and you blamed immigrants. Not the twat who says Muslim women are oppressed and objectified then defends them by calling them letter boxes and bank robbers. 

Our work prospects are diminished by people eroding working rights. 

You need to pay the piper. There's a reason doctors, nurses and paramedics voted for strikes. Because paramedic salaries are 23,000 pounds not 30,000 which they SHOULD be to match purchase power in 2004. 

But these people will keep voting conservative and then expect us to work for free. I did. I put up 8 hours on a Saturday because we couldn't possibly ask the other doctor to come in because they had horrific diarrhoea from a patient who failed to mention that and poisoned staff with food poisoning from things they brought in. 

Want to know something fun? 

My trust threatened staff with charges of theft for drinking coffee or tea from the canteens.

* I liked seeing women do a prohibited activity in Iran without the sky falling (really, hoping that someone who believes in these type of prohibitions might somehow see the image). I do believe that will happen, even if it's only a handful of men in power, but hell, keep these types of images flowing.

You are literally a hero for surviving this kind of family. I am currently working on a post to educate the people about it. Some cry for help letters I read from the survivors left me numb. Of course, all narcissist families in the world follow a single script, but it is exhausting in a Muslim family. People think Muslim women are oppressed. At home, typically, a different picture is run. Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do to change them in your mainstream Islam since its ideology is pretty atheistic. This makes getting away with torture very easy for these families. 

I am basically from Quran only community. From observation I can tell you that narcissist Muslim families think twice before harming a Quranist. We approach life in a very different way and that is scary to them. For instance, if my mom (passed away) goes to ruin my reputation I would tell her: 

""Please, could you show evidence that I slept with a guy yesterday? Could you prove that it is my fault that I got myself molested? Dear mommy, I'll make it easy for you since you weren't with me that time. Just say that if your accusations against me are lies then you will want God's curse to be upon you"".

1867,dw9ojk2,"Ok 

""as Western society *not* traditionally held that women are subservient?""

I will lead you to the intersectional feminist. See feminist teach me that Islam is a feminism religion. Wearing a burka and things like that shouldn't been seen by our western eyes and we should be emphatic. 

Hence, we should see women that lived in that time with the same value as the society at that time. St this time, for a women, that was the carrier and a lot of women were perfectly fine with this. Just my grand mother was one of the first women to work where I come from and she left her work when she married my grand-father and she was happy about that. So if you say it's being oppressed, well Muslim women are oppressed and feminist should do something about it. 

Ok for the politic, I will ask you another question. Women are the majority in education, nurse and thing like that. Is there any ""feminiarchy"" that keep man out of those work field? Does that make any sens to you? 

So why feminist push for that, but won't push for more men in women work field ? How's that not a double standard?

You need to be very ignorant to push the fault on man. 

Ok for black Indian and Indian, i don't know. I can comment on that topic. But I can ask you why there is no white in African politic? Like white farmer are being killed and nobody give a shit about them. 

Stop mixing everything together.

Why do you want to change my mind?"

1869,dti9771,"It's not allying with Islam, it's being respectful to the victims of Islamic oppression. When some people out there are banning hijabs, it means islamic women are now in a doubly oppressed damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don't situation. You won't help these women by removing their rights, they need to be told that one group of people cares about them and their oppression, but respect their choices. 

When women are free they will make free choices. You can't declare yourself the arbiter of good choice.

&gt;Women who work as sex workers choose to do as well but how many would choose that without economic pressures?

That's not an argument against sex work; it's an argument against the economic pressures that force people into that situation to begin with. If a woman tells you she was forced into prostitution because the alternative was homelessness, you're not helping her by banning prostitution: that's just condemning her to homelessness!"

Why don’t we let women choose what they want to wear instead of forcing them to wear something like some Muslims do. Forcing someone to do something is oppression. Western women are FREE to choose.

And I don’t spend too much time on anti-Islam sites. I merely see the world as it is unlike you. I didn’t realize the taliban, the Saudi oppression, the General fucked up sstate in the Mid East is propaganda created by anti-Islam sites. Why don’t you open up your mind and look at the world instead of being blind. Anyways, all I need is the verses from your holy book to see women are oppressed in your religion.

If you had a decent grasp of the English language you would know what my argument is but I guess you don't (funny how English is my third language yet I have a greater understanding of grammar, sentence structure and a far greater vocabulary than most native speakers). 

Anyway, my argument is that the vast majority of issues plaguing the middle east/muslim world is due to colonialism and surrounding issues, for example things like western countries staging coups against stable often times democratically elected governments (like in Iran) or the assassination of heads of state (like Liaquat Ali Khan, Pakistan's first prime minister). Basically western intervention in its many forms is the reason for most of the Muslim world's ills. The above poster's ridiculous comment is stating that Muslims are especially worse than other former colonies and this is due to Islam. This is an obviously ridiculous claim, even a very basic look at Islamic history will show you that this chaos plaguing the Muslim world is out of the ordinary when compared with the rest of the 1400 years Islam has existed. He constantly ignores that fact that even after colonialism, intervention in the affairs of Islamic countries has not stopped (like when in the 70's Pakistan's Prime Minister was tried and executed in a Kangaroo court by a US sponsored General who then took control and with the aid of the US introduced Islamization policies (really wahhabization policies, imported from Saudi) in the country and again with the Aid of the US began training Mujahideen to fight the soviets) and the fact that the Middle East/Muslim world was the most recently colonized area in the world by the west after the fall of the Ottomans and usually the early stages of colonialism are the harshest and involve the most massacres and the most resource stealing, most other colonies were in much better shape when they gained their independence than much of the Muslim world.

He then goes on to state that women have a gender pay gap in muslim countries to some how prove that Muslim women are more oppressed than other colonies and that reason is due to Islam, I asked for evidence and he showed me a statistic that only proves that women typically do not work at all in Muslim countries like it proves his point or something. I was addressing that claim that women not working doesn't mean there is a pay gap when women work."

Arguing semantics is pointless &amp; petty. I hope you're proud. 

Ever heard of the amazons, suffragettes etc. Women are not delegated to the role of motherhood because they deserve it. There're many women who can act as paternal role models to children and your arguments are hollow, bigoted and sexist.

Furthermore. WTF are u talking about. How does my arguments in relation to Islam being inherently sexist and Muslim womens utter blindness to the suppression of their own free wills at the hands of Islam, have to do with parental roles and the belief that women deserve to be controlled.

Wow, chill out adolf. There's nothing wrong with atheism, you're the only one that sounds nihilistic, disorder is the natural state of everything. Blaming it on equality is pointless. At least the modern worlds approach to peace isn't warmongering as the Islamic solution would most likely be.

 * That being a homemaker means you are pushed into some form of slavery and aren't allowed to pray, go out, etc.

1882,dpsvesw,"&gt;Oppress women? Are you a feminist/Marxist?

One doesn't have to be a feminist to notice that Middle Eastern (Islamic) women are mistreated and abused. They are denied an education, unable to drive, married off at a young age at the begest of their fathers. Isn't there a bible verse that states, ""Treat you wife as you would the church."" Therefore, it's evident that women shouldn't oppressed, but they should use their free will and be guided from birth to love and worship God.

&gt; Women are literally attracted to the devil's pleasures. Women can rationalize anything.

Do you realize anyone can be **_""attracted to the devil's pleasures?_** Imagine if someone played the sex card and stated, *""Men are lustful pigs who only think with their dicks.""* I'm pretty sure you call it an ad-hominem.




&gt;Do you even know how women think? Women are literally attracted to the devil's pleasures.

Women aren't a hive mind. I don't have to know their minds to see that your literally being sexist and dumb. To your second claim, how do you explain male fags being the majority of pedophiles and more likely to obtain HIV/AIDS? That's one point of male degeneracy. **See, I can play the sex card too, lol (sarcasm)**

&gt;This is the reason women don't mind prostitution as she sees it a bunch of stupid men giving her pleasure all day. 

Can you prove that **every woman ** worldwide that concedes to whoredom? Also, don't mostly men hire prostitutes? I'm not being sexist like you, just pointing out that men and women are degenerates without God.

Look, you should pray to God and relinquish your hatred towards women. Good day to you."
1883,dqe6y8d,"1. As I stated before, I am from the South East Asia (from the India-Pakistan-Bangladesh region). I can’t tell you any more specifics, sorry (people will know it’s us). 

2. My husband is an American and he is an engineer - so despite me having a good job and a career back in the country, I had to move to USA (because it only made financial sense).

3. Legal challenges were the worse. It saddens me that when you want to enter this country legally, they make it harder for you. But if you are can get here illegally, everything is free. For example: because I came here with a fiancé visa (it only made sense because we reconnected after 9years and Both of us wanted to make sure that we are doing the correct thing) the USCIS gave me a conditional green card. The conditional green card expired after 2 years and just before 90days of expiring, I have to apply for my permanent green card with more proof of being in a relationship (married in this case). The real ID Act implemented in several states doesn’t allow me to apply for DL because USCIS will take a year to process my papers!!! 

Financial - we had to spend nearly 10k to meet all the requirements for the government (includes producing proof of relationship and fees and such)

4. I like USA because it is a country of individualism and freedom of speech. I have never covered my head (because it isn’t a law in my country), however, we have to dress modest. Not that I dress here provocatively, but, just wearing a sleeveless tank and a Capri doesn’t earn me looks here. Also, I can hangout with anyone at night feeling safe - I have the opportunity of calling 911 without the fear of being called names or whore for being out at night. Please, don’t get me wrong, but being out late isn’t a thing in our culture at all - be it a guy or a girl.

One thing that I do not like about USA is the stereotypes - I have gotten looks when they heard I am a Muslim. I have been asked to participate in discussions on how Muslims are ruining this country. The embassy even denied visit visa for my parents (70 and 60yr old) only because it looked suspicious (a Muslim woman having a baby with a Christian man? Even though My husband gave them the guarantee that they will go back after they meet their first grandchild)

5. I am a Muslim and I believe in God. You will be surprised if you knew how many Muslim women are out there in the world and you wouldn’t have a clue. I agree, some are oppressed, but not all. Some women chose to cover their heads for better connection with God, some chose to stay how they are and are just as comfortable declaring it. "

I just want to remind that in Islam women were given the right for divorce, and also inheritance (along side other things that I don't want to go in details to keep my post short), yet many countries denied that right for women until few centuries ago. 

Another point is that I like how women in the west are used as an object yet it is considered a form of beauty. I honestly saw several car magazines and houses for rent that had women standing in front of the cars/Villas, now what should we call that? Isn't it a way of using women to grab the attention of men?

What about the rise of the Porn industry? Most female porn stars get paid more than men and most people who buy/watch porn are men.

Honor killings, at fault when they're the ones who were the victims of rape, female genital mutilation...I wasn't raised Muslim so I won't mock Islam, but I know many people, current and ex Muslims, who have a strong distaste for the way Muslim women are often treated by fellow Muslims.

MUSLIM women are being oppressed and Donald Trump wants to prevent them from escaping to a better world in the U.S. And my god, won't somebody please think of the children!

&gt;Why point that out unless you have an agenda against those two groups?  It's horrible and she should be punished and is on trial, in a London court.  It's not as if people are ignoring her because of those things.

Men and women are equal. End of story. And you're right that women have way more privilege legally than men do, so *what* the hell are you trying to accomplish with feminism?

A) You never say why feminism is the solution for any of this, and not only is that actually necessary for your argument, but it's also because because...

I presented my arguments specifically on letting people in ""because they like European culture and ethics"". I outlined why it is not feasible. Your comment is addressing completely different issues.

As I said I don't necessarily disagree but what you suggest is largely impractical (as not gonna work) or inefficient (at least there are no solid facts to indicate so). 

First of all:

&gt; While many women may choose to stay home and wear their publicly illegal niqab

They are not required to wear niqab at home by their rules. Noone gonna just wear it at home, it doesn't make a lot of sense. Whether it will or not have an effect on the next generations is also questionable, because actually, very little % of European Muslims wear a niqab. A ban on the niqab is telling what women must or must not wear, it may very well be an oppression itself because a most of Muslim women are actually ... Muslims and believe (or brainwashed) that this is right behavior. I don't see any problem it gonna solve except for pushing the oppressed population away from society.

&gt; endorsement of Nazi ideals

Sure, let's jail people who advocate oppression but punishing victims of the oppression is counterproductive. Actually, Germany is not thought-policing Nazis, they police only ones who speak, I told that in context of letting people in or not based on their beliefs. A closeted Nazi won't be denied immigration just because he is a Nazi.

&gt; being tolerant of the systemic sexism

Hom bout we think of measures against the tolerance of the systemic sexism itself and not just make up measures that punishing the victims."

Any argument that this ban helps oppressed women is bullshit. And it's always the argument of the islamophobes.

1895,dokn78o,"I read most of the comments here, and here are my 2 cents.

As an ex-muslim, and a man married to a woman that used to cover from head to toes. I have to say that you Canadians are a work of art. You are polite, caring, and generally good to your core. You believe in goodness, and freedoms, which is something that brightens my day, every day.

BUT, just because you believe in granting freedoms, it doesnt mean that you understand how those freedoms can be abused.

I am with everyone here who is enraged that muslim women are being oppressed. I oppose every law or action done by a government to limit the freedoms of any human being. Whatever and wherever they are.

BUT, you guys have no idea what you're defending here. Most of you are just scared shitless of this religion, and you have every right, muslims kill, muslims blow, muslims invade and destroy. You are right to be scared of them, but you're so polite, and you dont want to say how scared you are. So you use your politeness to grant that religion and its followers all the freedoms they ask for. Which is what pisses me off about you ladies and gents.

I challenge every one of you to go get a black bed sheets, put a small opening in them, and cover yourself from head to toes. Go out in the street, go to your colleges, go to your jobs, pick up the groceries, meet your friends in a pub or restaurant. Do it for a day or 2, and then tell me how enlightened you feel about this religious practice.

Most of you dont know how this religion treats its followers, especially the women. You just listen to those moderate muslims who spread their silly propaganda about how this is the religion of peace, love, and acceptance. It is NOT.

This religion considers women half the worth of the men. This religion asks for the death of gays. This religion asks all its followers to KILL anyone who leaves this religion. It is not the religion of peace.

Women who cover in black are not enjoying their religious freedoms. They are just a piece of furniture owned by their husbands/brothers/fathers. They are protected by this piece of clothes, because they are treated as a commodity. It is the ultimate dehumanization of any person. Women are reduced to a piece of meat, that if seen by other people, it is just spoiled and treated like garbage.

The first time my wife took off her black cover, she closed her eyes, as the wind blew through her beautiful hair for the first time in public. She felt the sun on her face, and her face was just gorgeous. I... cried at that moment. It was a moment of triumph for me and her. We have escaped this barbaric religion. We knew what it was, and we left it. We saw the sun, and we escaped the oppression. We enjoyed the sun on our faces, and we didnt care that we put a target on our back for being apostates.

You are opposing the ban on niqab, but you should be celebrating. It is THE ULTIMATE festival of freedoms that anyone can ever give those poor women.

If you want to tell me how this ban infringes on freedoms, and human rights, please stop. Go get educated on this religion, and then come talk to me, I welcome any educated discussion.

1902,dmg1nsc,"I would argue that it isn't really. Full converts are accepted as Jews without any cultural ties that most people would define as being ethnoreligous. They probably wouldn't know the typical cultural mannerisms associated with being Jewish.  I may be culturally Jewish to outsiders but it's like automatically assuming one is Christian just because they celebrate Christmas. It's not necessarily the case. What gentiles see as being ""Jewish"" is actually a product of cultural behavior common to the area of origin occurring along with religious practice and doctrines that will be a guide to societal behavioural practices.  For example ""Jewish women are loud and outspoken"", that might be because they have had, at least in mainstream Judisim and not extreme branches, a little more freedom and equality if compared to other Abrahamic religions. Other doctrines allowed a little more freedom to work on days others found sacred, lend money, etc. Those freedoms then become associated with that religious group as a culture, as seen by outsiders. It's a prejudice attitude just as you might claim all Muslim women are oppressed. Maybe but is that because of their religion  and how they practice it or is it part of their culture. I know ""Muslim"" women that do not exhibit any such stereotype if raised in a mixed religion home with liberal minded parents. I was given a choice of conversion when my parents thought I was old enough. Had I chose to convert despite my maternal side not being Jewish, I can then claim to be Jewish.  My brother chose to convert, he is Jewish.  I did not and am in fact an atheist, maybe even a nihilist. If beliefs define a culture is atheism a culture? Is Nilism? Maybe. I suppose it depends on your definition of what culture is. I see myself as more culturally English and Dutch. However, given your argument some other Jews in a fringe community and most likely secular themselves, (at least in my experience) claim that because I know some words and phrases in Hebrew and Yiddish and could make my way some what gracefully through high holidays might see me as ""good enough"" but am I welcome at shul or temple? Maybe but probably not seeing as I have no idea what I am doing, never had a bat mitzvah etc. I just know what I know through observation of what my family has done in my presence. I will concede that it might be semantics and certainly subject to opinion  but saying Jews are a race is usually offensive. If you're curious, since my knowledge of catholicism and judisim is merely a byproduct of a bipartisan upbringing, I suggest you visit www.jewfaq.org. It's helped me socially navigate my practising family members.

They're a symptom of oppression, not the oppression themselves, and banning them is akin to banning black eyes in order to combat domestic violence.

The heart of the matter is you said burqas should be banned because they're oppressive.

Nor should i.

Are you sure you're reading my comments before responding?

Being a tool of oppression does not make something oppressive.

Should we ban cricket bats if they have been used in domestic violence?

Are walls oppressive? What about if someone is being locked in their house against their will?

Should these things be banned? They have been used as tools of oppression in the past.

&gt;Enough said. More than enough reason for them to be banned.

Nope. Not even close.

These are great reasons to not have laws that enforce the oppression you're talking about. If someone said we should make it mandatory for all women to wear burqas, i'd be making the same appeal to logic that people don't throw away other people's personal freedoms in favour of conservative politics.

There's no case at all there to ban the burqa.

You're ignoring freedom of expression, freedom of religion, stereotyping minorities, persecuting minorities, all sorts of social justice issues.

Why? what's so offensive about burqas that mean you should be throwing these babies out with the bath water?

Because you don't like to be reminded that some Muslim women are oppressed by their communities?

You know what's oppressive?

Banning harmless aspects of ethnic minorities cultures.

No one gets hurt by wearing a burqa. If they were forced to do so, the harm has already been done. The coercion itself is the harm. Not the burqa.

You're advocating to ban the symptom, not the disease. The only people disadvantaged by your ban will be the victims of that oppression."

**Trinamool minister Siddiqullah Choudhury slams Supreme Court on Triple Talaq - Times of India** 

 ______ 
KOLKATA: Mamata Banerjee 's cabinet colleague, minister for libraries, Siddiqullah Choudhury slammed the Supreme Court for banning triple talaq. He said that his Jamaite Ulema Hind will be defying the Supreme Court order on talaq, as he said that the SC verdict was unconstitutional.""This banning of triple talaq is a design of BJP government. The government wants to change the Constitution now. Let them change it. We want to move a review petition before the Constitution bench of the SC.""Choudhury said that the views expressed were not that of Trinamool Congress , though he was a minister. It was his views as head of West Bengal Jamiate-Ulemae Hind. ""We will defy the SC judgment, as it is unconstitutional. The Constituent Assembly had accepted the Shariat Act of 1937 and it is reflected as part of the fundamental rights in the Constitution.""He said : We will be holding a meeting on August 28 at Mahajati Sadan and then we will decide what to do, where intellectuals will also be present. We do not accept this ban and will continue with the triple talaq. He said that only a minuscule population suffer for talaq which is barely 3% of the Muslim population.""It is barely a necessity to make any new law. BJP is making it a weapon to uphold the flag of Hindutva. Muslims are only answerable to Allah for doing any wrong."" He said that the government should make laws to stop lynching.""If needed we will bring lakhs of supporters of Jamait to protest against this unconstitutional ruling of the SC. We are competent to bring lakhs of people to collapse the city.""""India is also our country and will not accept any forcible attempt to change the law of the land,"" Siddiqullah said.""If Didi asks anything I will tell the facts,"" the minister said. He reminded that in earlier meetings of the Jamait, state ministers Partha Chatterjee and Firhad Haklim were present in it to support them against the ban on triple talaq.""When Chief Justice of India, J S Khehar has asked questions and has asked for protection of Muslims through articles 21, 24 and 25, how can the three judges of SC pronounce something unconstitutional. The one time talaq is legally accepted in India since 1937 and how can the SC change it."" He admitted there were abuse of talaq and for which he suggested a monitoring committee at state level and even at the panchayat level to check abuse of triple talaq.He said that the India government should hold a review meeting with the experts before framing any law. He said that they will be creating awareness on talaq in Madrasahs and in Friday prayer meetings. ""We have over 1000 Madrasahs under our control.Those who are progressive and do not bother about religious rituals, they should read Quran and Hadis before speaking anything. We bother little what Taslima Nasreen is saying. She is not even allowed in her country.""He added that it is untrue that only Muslim women are oppressed, there are oppression in all religion.When asked that many Islamic countries had banned talaq, he said that in India laws need to be governed according to need of the people of the land. ""For that the CJI had also mentioned that according to Indian needs the laws are to be framed here.""The Trinamool minister said that BJP is trying to impose Uniform Civil Code, but they will not be successful. All these 70 years many people had attempted it but failed.He reiterated that the three judges had tried to prove that there is nothing in Islam, but it is wrong. ""But it is a practice over 1400 years. Attempts to change the Constitution will also be challenged. Only women in BJP offices are rejoicing, which is being highlighted by the media, but you will hardly find ordinary women happy with it.""Siddiqullah said that there are 3 crore Muslims in Bengal who are against the SC order, when he was reminded that a woman from Howrah had filed the petition on talaq.

1911,dh96ir9,"Of course it's not going to happen overnight.

But look at 10 years ago compared to now. Did you ever dream in 2017 we'd have people bending over backwards to make sure, no matter what, Islam is the first thing defended? It's barbaric and their ultimate goal *is* world domination. They've come out and explicitly said it. They openly kill gays in their countries and women are so oppressed they can't show any skin other than their eyes because the Islamic men are so unhinged they might have a sexual emergency.

There's also a lot, lot, lot of inbreeding within Islam. And of course marrying 9 year old brides. You think that belongs in any modern society? I don't."
1912,djmeh80,"lol i've seen people saying that Muslim women are oppressed but at the same time believe that muslims should be nuked, i don't know what more bad can happen to those muslims women aside from being nuked tbh. those people are ridiculous "
1913,djswbns,All muslim women are oppressed. Has more to do with being beaten to death if she takes the tent off than avoiding social interaction though. That parts a-okay.
1914,dk41wz4,What makes you think it's not what they want? You can make that argument about places where it's compulsory like Afghanistan but what evidence do you have of that being true in Belgium? Other than your assumption that all Muslim women are oppressed.
1915,dkd8zy7,"Hit the nail on the fucking head. This is what alot of people don't understand that there is a global movement to make Islam as a victim and the way to the future...blah blah blah. However, most ""civilized"" liberals don't understand that if Muslims had their way, women would be suppressed, beaten, etc and men would be the leaders in every society. Governments may try and make out that Muslim women are not oppressed, but in the Koran, women are subordinate creatures to their husbands. "
1916,dko3kcl,"I acknowledge that some Muslim women are being oppressed, and I'm against anyone being oppressed. However, I'm against people generalising most Muslim women for being ''oppressed'. Until there's a poll which shows the amount of Muslim women who face opression, no one can say ''Most Muslim women are opressed''."
1917,dgviw4q,"I think the Islam issue is more to do with western vs middle eastern views on what freedom and equality is. 

I'm sure to plenty of Islamic women, they would think that the things western feminists fight for in light of ""freedom"" and ""equality"" are pointless. Just like what we deem as freedoms and equality doesn't fit with their beliefs. 

Feminism isn't compatible with Islam because they are two very different beliefs. But that doesn't mean Islamic women are oppressed; not to them anyway. "
1918,di6gtw2,Yea because the Muslim women are probably aren't allowed to leave the house or are busy being oppressed by an actual rape culture.
1919,difpgg8,Ive said it earlier. Some muslims are forced. And parents force their children to do many things. In many cultures. However to claim a majority of muslim women are oppressed must be backed by some facts. A survey of some sorts. 
1920,dijxkam,Well muslim women are oppressed. They have to walk around with bedsheets on them.
1921,discjyz,"That's true for some women and not true for others. Many Muslim women choose to wear these things, but a lot of Muslim women are also forced to wear it. Some Muslim women are oppressed and some are not.

There is variation to everything in life. "
1922,diwsg7u,Umm yeah pretty much. Few outliers.  Muslim women are the most oppressed people on earth according to sex.  Women in western societies have had equal rights for 40 years.  Women rule family and civil courts in Western civilization and more women graduate from US universities than men.  Women have the upper hand in Western civilization.  
1923,dj0rkqy,"&gt; You are making a lot of assumptions right now. Please, show me a study on how Muslim women actually agree with this. You're just telling me about how ideally, women respect men and because of this they agree with what the Qu'ran says. If this were the case, why are western islamic women becoming more and more providers for their family? How about instead of making all of these assumptions, you muslim men ask muslim women how they feel?

Well that's exactly my point. When people claim Muslim women are ''oppressed'' or ''forced to wear the headscarf'' was there studies done on every Muslim women to make such claims? I would understand and respect If people claimed some Muslim women, not all. I'm kind of triggered when people make such claims because all of the female in my family happily wear head scarfs. I'm happy that Muslim women in the West are independent, but you have to realise Islam doesn't stop women from being independent, culture does. Yes, Islam claims women should rely on Husbands and family, but that is for the sake of Muslim women. You will have to understand whenever I talk from women's perspectives, I'm talking about the ones which solely follow the teaching of Islam. That is what the Western world fail to understand or perhaps ignore. You can't claim Muslim women are oppressed for 2 reasons: Firstly, Westerners have yet to make a study on all Muslim women, why you may ask? Well because when Westerners make claims like ''Muslim women are oppressed'' not ''Some Muslim women in this particular area or country are being oppressed'' I find that very ignorant.

&gt; First of all, this is homophobic because you're pointing out that their lifestyle is wrong. There's nothing wrong with a homosexual lifestyle. Not only that, how is this verse ""clearly about Muslims not homosexuals"". It's obviously talking about men fucking other men. And how does it not give Muslims the right to harm homosexual when it's clearly talking about ""raining brimstones"" (aka STONING THEM). You are not fooling anyone, buddy

Islam like many other religions sees homosexuality as not only a sin, but also a mental disorder. The thought of two man having two men or two women having sexual intercourse is not logical. For example: Do you know the consequence of having anal sex? Not only is it dirty impure, but can also cause anal cancer. That in itself proves that homosexuality was not meant to be. Islam is all about logical thinking, and for Islam homosexuality is not logical in anyway or from. Even If I wasn't a religous person, I would still find homosexuality to be illogical. I don't think Islam is homophobic, I think Islam is just trying to educate people about how homosexuality is morally wrong. For example: If someone did not agree with Muslim women wearing head scarfs, would I call them islamophobic? Not I would not, though I would find them ignorant because Muslim women chose to wear head scarfs not forced. I don't get why homosexuals can't do the same thing? Perhaps because they know themselves homosexuality is wrong and have to defend them- selves in such an illogical way.

&gt; I'll let you have this one. However, I find it weird that there's a verse about women divorcing their husband,and not a verse reassuring women that they'll find a better husband. it's almost like the Qu'ran is implying that the husband can do no wrong, and that if a divorce occurs, it's always the woman's fault. And why are men allowed to marry multiple women but women aren't allowed to marry multiple men?

Not trying to be rude, but you sound like a feminazi. Not everything has to be about females and males. After all, we are not children. We as adults understand even If something serves soley one of the sexes, it's intention is meant to be good. God is not favoring women in this verse, and no, God is definitely not saying men can't make mistakes in marriage. Besides, any Muslim who knows about Islam, should know not to look down on women in marriage due to this verse. That is un islamic and Muslim men know better. 

&gt; ""I guarantee you."" Yeah, buddy. Not good enough for me. Please show me a non-biased study and then we can talk. A problem we keep running into over and over again is that you think you can speak for women, but clearly that's not the case. You're making a lot of assumptions about what women think, and that in and of itself is sexist. Sexism that is being endorsed by the Qu'ran. Show me a non-biased study

I'm glad you brought up this point. Basically, I've learned that from the lovely Westerners. They are pros at making claims without having made any studies on their claims.To be quite frank, I started doing the same. I mean, should I just sit in silence while people make biased claims about Muslim women? Especially since I have Muslim females and they would agree with me. I guess we can agree on one thing: That is to not make claims without having evidence to back up our claims. Sadly, the West fail to understand that, or at this point, I have a feeling the West rather ignore the fact that they need evidence before making claims.


&gt; How is this not blatantly sexist/offensive? ""Alright Muslim men, if you act good in this lifetime, I'll reward you with 72 women with super tight vaginas."" That's literally the definition of turning women into a sex object. THEY'RE LITERALLY USING WOMEN AS A REWARD. How is this something you're not able to grasp? And where did you get the information that men are more sexual than women? That's biased information because of how sexually repressed women are

 I find it hypocritical that the same people that calls houri ''sexisti'' approve of sex-dolls. That alone tells you that the West is against Islam because it disagrees with their illogical life-style not because Islam is ''wrong''. Anyways, you have to realise houri's are considered as robots, not humans. I don't got how that would be considered sexiest when sex-dolls are not? And their whole purpose is to fulfill the sexual desires Muslim men controlled their whole life.


&gt; Uhhh, they are following Islam. I just gave you the verses at the top.

It almost sounds as if you are blaming Islam for the mistakes of people. Which is ironic to me, because people follow Islam not the opposite. It doesn't matter If one is a Muslim or not, what matters is that person contributes to their own ideology not Islam. The logic behind saying ''they are Muslims they follow the verses'' is self defeating. Firstly: If these verses were actually not out of context, why are not more  Muslim following these veres? Secondly: People who claim these veres are not taken out of context, they all have one thing in common. That is that they don't understand the verses themselves and ask Muslims to explain it to them. So my question is, instead of thinking theses verses are taken out of context with truly understand them, how about them ask for their true meaning before jumping to conclusions?.


&gt; Also, why are you posting on /r/incels? You're not an involuntary celibate. You stay celibate for religious purposes.

You can also become celibate for personal reasons."
1924,dj16kwn,"&gt;Well that's exactly my point. When people claim Muslim women are ''oppressed'' or ''forced to wear the headscarf'' was there studies done on every Muslim women to make such claims? I would understand and respect If people claimed some Muslim women, not all. I'm kind of triggered when people make such claims because all of the female in my family happily wear head scarfs.

Well because when Westerners make claims like ''Muslim women are oppressed'' not ''Some Muslim women in this particular area or country are being oppressed'' I find that very ignorant.

The reason why all the women in your life ""happily"" wear the headscarf is because they've been manipulated and brainwashed into thinking that wearing it is a symbol of modesty. Nobody can genuinely say that they're happy wearing it without that bias. Even if you want to say that I can't genuinely say that they're UNHAPPY wearing it either, it doesn't matter since you have the burden of proof. 

&gt;Islam like many other religions sees homosexuality as not only a sin, but also a mental disorder. The thought of two man having two men or two women having sexual intercourse is not logical.

Perhaps because they know themselves homosexuality is wrong and have to defend them- selves in such an illogical way.

Okay, you are wrong on so many levels here. First of all, lesbians can't have anal sex. Secondly, heterosexuals can. Third, you just pointed out that two men having sex isn't illogical, what about women? Fourth, what does ""logical"" mean? What does it mean for a sexual desire to be ""logical""? Fifth, if you don't think Islam is homophobic, what is your definition of homophobia when you literally have these viewpoints about these people and on top of that, follow a book that actively endorses stoning them? Sixth, how could Islam possibly be about ""logical thinking"" when it constantly contradicts new scientific findings and tells its followers to always choose Islam over science? Seventh, how is homosexuality ""morally wrong"" when it literally doesn't adversely affects anyone's lives except for the homosexuals that are getting stoned as a result. Eighth, if homosexuality ""wasn't meant to be"",why did God create it?

&gt;Not trying to be rude, but you sound like a feminazi. Not everything has to be about females and males. After all, we are not children. We as adults understand even If something serves soley one of the sexes, it's intention is meant to be good.

Not trying to be rude, but you sound like every /r/incels user ever. Please explain to me why I should understand that if something solely serves one of the sex, it's intention is meant to be good? I don't understand the assumption you're telling me to make here. If it solely serves one of the sex, why would it beneficial for the other sex at all?

&gt;I find it hypocritical that the same people that calls houri ''sexisti'' approve of sex-dolls. That alone tells you that the West is against Islam because it disagrees with their illogical life-style not because Islam is ''wrong''. Anyways, you have to realise houri's are considered as robots, not humans. I don't got how that would be considered sexiest when sex-dolls are not? And their whole purpose is to fulfill the sexual desires Muslim men controlled their whole life.

I find it stupid that you don't know the difference between a sex doll and an actual human being. How can houri's be considered to be robots if they get labeled as a ""virgin""? Being a ""virgin"" is a human characteristic. Yeah Muslim Men really do a great job at controlling their sexual urges (hint: they don't. The sexual violence rates in the Middle East is extremely high.)

&gt;It almost sounds as if you are blaming Islam for the mistakes of people. Which is ironic to me, because people follow Islam not the opposite.

Well you explained the context to me above, and they still seem pretty awful to me. Point being, even in context, they are awful. I don't understand how ""context"" could possibly serve as a justification for some of the horrendous things the Qu'ran has to say.

&gt;You can also become celibate for personal reasons.

You really aren't helping your cause that muslim men aren't sexist by posting in that subreddit."
1925,dj8wilc,"This is an interesting point that's beyond the silliness of the Daily Mail. The far right in general uses this ""feminazi"" argument all the time. Because we've progressed our society to the point where we all agree that racism, homophobia and misogyny are bad, the hard right has to find ways of still practising these whilst dodging these labels. The ""everyone I don't like is Hitler"" one is really frequent on here, it's a clever defence that allows them to act like a fascist and then try to make whoever calls them on it look hysterical. Another common one is where they are intolerant of Islam ""because Muslims are intolerant"". They've found a way to rip on Islam out in the open by saying that they think Muslim women are oppressed or whatever.   "
1926,djc687y,Muslim women are OPPRESSED.  lol.   
1927,djcf4t6,"Except that we are forever hearing about how Muslim women are oppressed, yet here we see such women literally enslaving others. So they are obviously not all the poor oppressed innocents that they're portrayed to be."
1928,dhe1dm8,"TBM: Poor Muslim women are so oppressed! They make them cover from head to toe




Temple Dude: The ladies will veil their faces"
1929,dhe8oua,"&gt; go through great religious surpression like muslim women

Not all muslim women are oppressed. Islam was actually quite progressive for women in its day in that it was the first abrahamic faith to permit women to own property, keep their dowries, sign contracts, and divorce husbands who don't sexually satisfy them.

Yes, there are some fundamentalist muslim sects today whose treatment of women is oppressive - but that's more political than religious. The religion is used to prop up the oppression, but it's done in ignorance. "
1930,dhibffw,"My original comment was directed towards a person specifically saying he dislikes far right populists, but that he also dislikes hijabs because he feels Muslim women are oppressed by being required to wear them by Muslim culture. So I respond saying that it is not required and that nowhere in the Quran does it specifically instruct women to wear hijabs or burqas. Then you push a strawman argument saying that the Quran has much worse hadiths, while also saying the new Testament also advocates violence when that has little relevance to the point I was making. You are making no sense whatsoever. "
1931,fywj0n1,"We are discussing Islamic law forcing women to wear burkas, which isn't even the worst thing they do to women and legally. You're talking about some patriarchy bs. What cause most preachers are men that somehow equates to the absolute misery a lot of Muslim women are forced to endure? Give me a break lol"
1932,frtr8qf,"I've asked you twice. Can you quote the verse/where in the Qur'an states that Muslim women are required to cover their head? I'm still waiting.

&gt;you've made your mind up about what's right and wrong based on the norms of your society

Ad hominem. I've never said what's wrong. Muslim women who wear hijabs are right and Muslim women who expose their hair are right. These two are not mutually exclusive, yet you have the audacity to imply I'm closed-minded without any form of irony on your part. I'm being *inclusive*, you're being **exclusive** by saying hundreds of millions of Muslim women are wrong for the absence of headscarves. I'm saying every single Muslim woman is *right* regardless of headscarves.

But let's go with your ad hominem: The norms of Pakistani society. Visit Pakistan. Your head would explode seeing tens of millions of Muslim women's hair. Pakistan's not Arab. Are you saying that interpretations of Islam not based on the patriarchy of Arabian culture is a false Islamic interpretation? There is no shortage of self-righteous Pakistani men too. Don't worry, they all agree with you.

You've twisted the meaning of khimar to imply that its purpose in the Qur'an is to cover the head. Its purpose in the Qur'an is to cover the chest. 

I've asked you two times to quote the verse in the Qur'an that requires Muslim women to cover their head and you've ignored it twice by instead showing me people's opinions on it and not the word of God. Like I said earlier, the loudest of religious people give the illusion that they're the most religious when they're not. They're just the most self-righteous.

I don't base my religious views on other people's interpretation of my religion. Religion is inherently faith-based. I am open-minded because I believe that Muslim women are equally Muslim whether they wear a headscarf or not. You're the narrow-minded one believing that hundreds of millions of Muslim women in the Middle East and South Asia are violating Islam because of not wearing a headscarf when there is no such statement in the Qur'an.

You don't like my Islamic beliefs so you're scapegoating the people around me."
1933,ftei0ib,"Many Americans used to be registered democrats until Obama came along. All I know is that these women, who roar and rail against male patriarchy are now wearing masks (BLM, RadMuz's, Antifa) like muslim women are forced to do and are now bowing down to black men. 'I am women hear me roar In too big numbers to ignore' is ova!  How'd these muslims, in charge of these groups, do it? Calling Gloria Steinman."
1934,fp63ecp,"I wouldn't be so sure about that...with westernization and the general decline of morals worldwide, Muslim women are getting evermore eager to rebel against the men in their lives as they feel they have been very major victims of so-called patriarchy and male control and influence in their lives.

All in all, do not go for Muslim women just because you think they know their place. They tend to be even worse than western women once their minds get poisoned and this is happening more and more by the day in today's world"
1935,fbsvlcq,"Ex-Muslim women are by far the only real feminists these days... that's because they've seen actual patriarchy.

Feminism won equality here, but the movement was already a cult by then not wanting to believe they won and not wanting to part with the victim status to excuse their short coming... with too much money to be made off of it capitalists have kept it going.  


{EDIT: Last part made me sound like a collectivist, I'm not}"
1936,fbx4spo,Thankfully more and more Muslim women are seeing these and countless other archaic religious traditions for what they really ALL are: a way for the patriarchy to reinforce gender inequality. Questions raised like whether the rules still apply to being around non-hetero women? As the world becomes more accepting of non-binary ways of approaching life.. these questions will become increasingly hard for the devout to dance around.
1937,faasww4,"Firstly I grew up in Mormonism which has an even more drastic male bias. No Mormon woman gets into heaven unless her husband calls her ""through the veil"" for example. They have no limit on the number of wives they can take (at least in the next life, nudge nudge wink wink). Nor do they support women working after marriage or having control of their own money.So when I began to look into Islam the list of rights that women were supposed to have was refreshing to say the least. 

As far as intermarriage I  try to understand the historical perspective and reasoning behind the ruling. Historically, Islam initially granted women rights they had not previously held in most cultures and the prohibition on inter-marrying was to ensure that they received the rights they deserved. So it made sense. 

Islamic rights are less of a concern for me, as an upper-middle-class western white woman in a fairly traditional Western marriage. We discussed all the relevant issues between us at the time I converted.  My rights are in no danger with my particular husband. Which is probably the reason I have received zero grief from anyone who knows us in person. 

 However,  I must acknowledge also that reality for the vast majority of Muslim women is very different. I mean Western culture is still very patriarchal but it's got nothing on some corners of the world. I can 100% understand not wanting to let your daughters get into an interfaith marriage where the rights they are supposed to have are going to be in some jeopardy or where  the husband has the power (either overt or covert) to control their religious practice or force a conversion to the husband's religion. 

Here in the west I think clinging to wanting your family to marry people from the same culture is actually a bigger factor in this situation than the actual islamic ruling sometimes. One of my good friends is Bangladeshi though she's been a US citizen for a long time, and she was recounting to me how surprised her family was that her daughters married non-Bangladeshi men. ""Those girls have never lived in Bangladesh! Their culture is American! Of course they married American men!"" she said. They chose their husbands, also, though they didn't ""date"" in the Western sense. But their parents allowed them the range of choice to find good Muslim men who were compatible with them, is the point I'm making. When parents have their childrens' best interest at heart it's less problematic.

So I do see it as well-meaning in context, if problematic in modern application. 

Of course the question of whether all Muslim women are receiving their rights as granted within Islam is a whole different kettle of fish and I think we all know the answer is ""unfortunately, not always."" I will go so far as to say that I personally would rather see a woman married to a supportive non-Muslim than an abusive Muslim if those were the ONLY choices. 

However there are lots and lots of really great Muslim men and I think in general for most born Muslims, staying within the faith makes a great deal of sense for BOTH genders. 

For me, married with a two year old and a child on the way when I converted, the options looked a lot different than they do for a 20 year old with the world at their fingertips. 

I'm not a fan of the patriarchy in general but it is such an entrenched structure that getting mad at it is almost a waste of energy. It's strangling itself to death and I don't mind standing on the cord to help speed the process...but taking the long view and seeing how things were supposed to be, where they're actually at, and how they got there is basically the only way to cope for me."
1938,evsnu3l,"Omg fuck off with that racist bullshit - so many Muslim women are grateful to live in the west and escape part of the patriarchy they experienced. 

You’re not even a fucking radfem, get the fuck out of our sub"
1939,ejygsoe,Western feminism in a nut shell. Oh women are so effected by the patriarchy that subconsciously it causes them a multitude of problems but Muslim women are completely uneffected and there's no way women growing up in  oppressive patriarchal religion are influenced at all. Totally.... Lmao 
1940,ehyisnr,"&gt; It's hard to challenge the prevailing narrative of personal choice in clothing without getting into why Muslim women are coerced into covering up.

It almost reminds me of how liberal feminists defend the sex industry. If you try to criticize problems with how it works in practice they'll say you aren't respecting women's *agency*. They can't or won't recognize that abuse, coercion, and patriarchy are what's limiting women's agency, not our words. Refusing to acknowledge reality won't make it go away, and if you defend an exploitative or oppressive practice in the name of the victim's ""agency"" you're just enabling further victimization at someone else's expense. It's frustrating to watch. "
1941,ecndhjv,"This is why, in another thread, I objected to Javids use of ""race""

This is driven by a cultural artifact that women outside the ummah are not treated with the same rules that Muslim women are, that exists within certain communities. This is rooted in a religious patriarchy that dominates the cultures within these communities. 

As a British SE Asian of Muslim heritage I've been privy to the ""all Western women are whores innit bruv"" conversations that white people don't hear. Mainly when I spent a few years working with Bangladeshi lads from Tower Hamlets. It IS a fact. 


It's NOT just a ""Muslim"" thing, it only exists in certain classes and communities. There isn't a single example of any Muslims from my part of the world, Malaysia/Indonesia/Philippines being involved. Its also unknown in the middle/professional/secular classes. 

It also explains why, a generation or two ago, the Muslim lads in Midlands and North first went for Sikh girls but were fought off by the Sikh men. Ie not a racial split, but a cultural issue with perception of non-Muslim women.

Oh, the Sikhs cared about their women and stopped it. White people and white systems and institutions didn't give a shit about their own.  This fact cannot be ignored. 

"
1942,ed2nmqj,"That’s true but in this protest some Muslim women are holding signs calling out “Brahmanical Patriarchy” while being dressed in a Burqa.

Why specifically call out Hinduism when their own religion is patriarchal?
Why not hold a sign just calling out patriarchy in general?

Patriarchy is rooted in Indian society, it’s not something exclusive to Brahmins and yet these protestors are focusing on one caste of a particular religion while turning a blind eye to the others which I find hypocritical.
"
1943,ebyt9ek,"Those Muslim women are being forced to wear the patriarchal head-coverings by men, but western feminists are okay with it because those Muslims tend to be minorities, and minorities are their allies against the white patriarchy.

"
1944,e3mmul2,It's not a patriarchy. I was raised Muslim and Muslim women are the biggest woman haters in the world.
1945,e1dkplv,"Doesn't matter if it's in Saudi Arabia or USA. Patriarchal societal standards become ingrained, I don't understand feminist one minute women have no choice due to how ingrained society patriarchy teaches women to be diminutive bores and the next second Muslim women are actually somehow able to overcome the harshest forms of a sexist patriarchal society and freely choose a veil? Lmao it's fucking bullshit. "
1946,e1nik9g,"""what piece of clothing does this for patriarchy"" exactly those that I had mentioned. Ask women why they want or feel like they should wear it, run a study and a considerable amount of answers will point out that they either do it so that others will perceive them as attractive or because they feel that it will make them more attractive. Placing a woman's selfworth in her appearance is a patriarchal construct. What's even better is that women will feel more attractive/suspect that others will find them more attractive (or more acceptable) in those particular clothes than if they wear clothing/articles that are targeted towards men. This is patriarchal. Again, where is the victimhood when it's a fact. Muslim women are being singled out and reprimanded. Not because people suspect that they have internalized misogyny but because people suspect that it oppresses them. We've been going back and forth for hours, my stance is that every human being should be allowed to eat whatever makes them feel comfortable, especially if it's as simple as adding on a headscarf. "
1947,dydp1yf,"That's the thing, I've seen a lot of 'feminists' say shirt like 'if you're a SAHM then you aren't doing your duty as a feminist' a lot of Muslim women are targeted by these pseudo feminists according to whom, burqas that they put on by their own choice is them being controlled by the patriarchy and you're setting feminism back by doing this. Like her choice doesn't matter, just what they think is right for a feminist "
1948,dxpieya,"Muslim women are told they need to wear burqas because they need to show modesty.

A pressure which families  put on their young daughters in the west. West is basically protecting the most vulnerable members of society by banning burqas.

Imagine the outrage if christians forced their young daughters to wear nune uniforms to show devotion and Modesty.

Frankly absurd and no place in a western society. A relic of the ""patriarchy"" if you want to call it.



"
1949,duwh5m1,"I don't know what you mean, Islam is a religion of peace and muslim women are liberated because they aren't forced to wear skimpy outfits by the patriarchy."
1950,drqylau,"Exactly. Nobody said the contrary brother. The argument is what is best for men as a whole and individually. A system that lets women do whatever they want, and ends with a debt system, social and cultural decline. Or a system where women are kept in check like in a religion, or the old patriarchy. This is a discussion that has been going on for a while in the manosphere. But for me the conclusion its obvious. It is best to live in a society that keeps women in check and only men make decisions, because even women will benefit from it.

Western muslim women are not kept in check therefore they are going to hamster their religion. Its crazy how they can hamster islam, even more crazy is how feminists dont condemn islam. I think only a fool cant see what women nature is all about at this point."
1951,dt022ip,"Who exactly is defending Islam or letting an even more patriarchal institution fill the void? Most feminists are just against anti Muslim bigotry just as they are against anti-semitism., they're not pro religious conservatism, sexism, etc. How exactly has it ""destroyed society""? Are you one of those folks who gets most of their information from anti sjw edgelords and pseudointellectual atheist  YouTubers like Sargon, thunderf00t etc?


 There's plenty of the same sort of bigotry in the Bible but you don't see the same sort of suggestions of sophistry etc directed at Christian  feminists or that it is an evil religion or absurd suggestions like feminists are trying to replace patriarchy with it. If someone were to defend bigotry directed at Jews by neonazis, does that mean they support Judaism or Zionism? Religious views do evolve with time, so it seems like a double standard to direct such criticism only towards one. Change can come incrementally, need not be a revolution overnight so if some Muslim women are fighting for their rights why deny them that and say something like they cannot be true feminists bc of Islam, so how exactly are they going to get their rights, how is this supposed to help anyone?

You keep saying feminists rail against Christianity but are naive about Islam etc. No they're just against anti Muslim bigotry, not pro religious sexism."
1952,dovrsfi,"You're stupid if you think Islam will be able to attain its traditional patriarchy and not assimilate into western culture. Islam is DONE im telling you guys remember my words, Islam will be even MORE cucked than the west is within 15 years tops. Muslim women are becoming more slutty' are demanding voting rights and driving rights. Saudi arabia leader says he will be more moderate and denounce salafism. You simply cannot have any form of traditionalism with the internet and media, all these women around the world are reading hashtags like #metoo, know about feminism.. Believe me feminism isn't going anywhere and the Muslims birthrates will drop as soon as the women enter western culture."
1953,do2hn2p,"They see sexism &amp; patriarchy around every corner, but when it comes to Islam, it's all perfectly fine.

The answer btw is not just sexism &amp; patriarchy, the answer is: demographics. If you allow polygyny to happen, the powerful older guys will claim the young beautiful women. Such a community ends up with a large surplus of single young adult males. That's a recipe for violence &amp; sexual aggression.

With Islam this already happens anyway, because the Muslim women are 'protected' from temptation, but the men are allowed to prey on the women of the unbelievers, causing lots of tension &amp; aggression.

Throw in polygyny and watch your society break down even quicker."

1958,dhanni8,"1. White feminism is a problem, but the wage gap isn't a so called issue. The others arent really 'issues', they're just easy symptoms of a sexist society to label and point out. 

Furthermore, people focus on their own society. That's not wrong. I can vote in the US. I can write a representative here. My voice is heard- and these issues are pressing to me. There's not much I can do about honor killings. I can donate money to feminists in different societies who are fighting that, I can donate to health organizations who oppose FGM and are fighting that. But if you're in the west- you're going to hear mainly about western issues. 




   5-  I think this is related to one. Feminism has an issue with any kind of patriarchy-  but western feminism is overwhelmingly impacted by Christian patriarchy. And Muslim women are a vulnerable group here- so it might make it seem like Islam is given a 'pass'. It's not. 


   6- Depends on what those efforts are and how they impact trials. Giving sensitivity courses to all police officers would go a ways to maybe making victims
More comfortable. De-stigmatizing victims would encourage reports. Better rape kit retrieval. There's a lot that could be done. 

   8- They're misinformed, and I would be surprised. Planned parenthood is not racist organization. And a founders (disputed and highly arguable) personally ideology does not have anything to do with the current organization. 

   9- Lack of education about feminism and smear campaigns. Plus, it's never been popular. Movements for change generally aren't "

**Triple talaq: Supreme Court needs a Muslim woman on the bench** 

 ______ 
A Sikh man, a Christian man, a Muslim man, a Hindu man and a Parsi man. What’s missing from this mix?

These are the judges who have begun hearing a string of petitions challenging triple talaq in the Supreme Court – a first for a court that is breaking from the tradition of two-month summer vacations.

But a case that is going to impact the fates of millions of women across India and fundamentally alter gender relations doesn’t have a woman judge. More importantly, it doesn’t have a single Muslim woman on the bench.

This isn’t a one-off phenomenon but keeps with the tradition of relatively few women judges across high courts and the Supreme Court, kept away from the halls of higher judiciary with what eminent women lawyers describe as a mix of sexual harassment, intimidation, glass ceiling and old-style misogyny.

In the sanctioned strength of 31 judges of the Supreme Court, there is only one woman. The situation is just as dire across high courts. In December, the law ministry released figures that showed that about 10% of the 650-odd judges working in high courts were women. Eight of the 24 high courts had an all-male bench.

This isn’t without precedence. The first woman judge was elevated to the Supreme Court 39 years after it was first set up. Only six of the 229 judges who have served on India’s highest court till 2015 were women. Among them, just one -- the first one -- was a Muslim woman.

Why does this happen? Statistics show that nearly half of all enrolments in law schools are women students, so the slip lies in the road between the classroom to the courtroom.

Senior women lawyers such as Indira Jaising have written at length how they’ve seen bright women lawyers and judges treated as sex objects and subjected to incessant sexual harassment, making impossible their entry into what is essentially a boys club.

What would the presence of more women, and women of diverse backgrounds of caste, region and religion, on judicial benches do? Many commentators say it would avoid judgements such as the Bhanwari Devi case – where the SC dismissed rape charges by saying that upper caste suspects would never touch lower-caste women – or in the infamous Mathura case, where the victim was said to be habituated to sexual intercourse because of her caste or background.

More importantly, a case such as triple talaq requires a complex mesh of gender and religious identities, associated fears and vulnerabilities that are best understood and articulated by women who come from similar locations in life.

Muslim women are in the unenviable position of having the honour of communities imposed on their bodies, while fighting the Hindu right-wing who are interested in saving some of them from triple talaq but not Zakia Jaffri or Bilkis Bano from riot violence.

These women have pioneered the struggle to re-interpret the Quran from times, as historian Margot Badran has shown, before modern conceptions of rights and feminism came into vogue. Organisations such as the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan have successfully argued why a gendered view of religion is important, while rejecting the stereotyping of Muslim communities as illiterate, backward and misogynistic.

They have led the fight against the practice, while simultaneously distinguishing their struggles from the Left and the Right, Hindu right-wing and Muslim hardliners. They have braved stigma at home and shame outside, fended off religious rhetoric and canonical dogma that has attempted to fence them into patriarchy. After centuries, their struggle is about to bear fruit. It is a shame that one of them isn’t going to shape their fate.

1960,fr6gml6,"Oh I completely agree that there are some good people out there (some are Muslim) who would report it if they knew. What I mean is, I was a part of those ""minority"" groups in a western country, and they systematically ignore sexism and sexual violence. However, they never ignore homophobia and misogyny, as in, they participated in them aggressively and openly. I'm not pointing fingers at decent individuals, I'm blaming groups who teach their children in their religious ""schools"" that women are less than men and that non-muslim women are basically just sexual pleasure tools for muslim men."
1961,fnyycfs,"Let them wear it, I mean honestly. We can go on about how they have internalized misogyny and stuff, but if a Muslim women claims that covering up is empowering, how can we argue with her preference? Some women feel empowered by being liberal in showing skin, others find modesty to be empowering. We all have our small biases and subjective tastes that may even be shaped by dogma, or whatever it is. You can even call it Stockholm Syndrome, as some critics may like to characterise it.

So, the origin of the Burqa and the Niqab is from Arabia, where those clothes served the purpose of insulation from extreme heat and to safeguard against dehydration, and to prevent sand from flying into their mouth and nostrils. Even the men cover from head to toe, in order to shield themself from the environmental factors, yet I dont see any of those Kasaragod dudes doing that. All in all, I agree that a certain degree of Arab fetishization maybe happening, but like for silly reasons. Muslim women are allowed by Islam to expose their hands and faces; the veiling of the face seems just like overkill to me.

There is a Hadith (short Islamic moral story), where a prostitute saw a dog dying of heat from dehydration. She went into a well, filled her shoe with water, and gave it to the dog. The Prophet then said to his companions that she will be going to paradise, regardless of her past sins. That one selfess act of kindness towards an animal was enough for her salvation. I really don't think the veil is a very reliable indicator of piousness, or goodness. If the Islamic god can forgive such a person who profits from the sins of the flesh, I think it's not too far of an extension when it comes to a veilless liberal Muslim woman being a valid Muslim.

Ofcourse, I have zero issues with Muslim women choosing to wear the veil, or discarding it after recognising it as an artefact of religion. It is ultimately a very personal preference, and I have a feeling the future generations may not really care about it, and will eventually discard it altogether."
1962,fk8vxt0,"&gt;Well do you want me to lie now islam allows us to do slavery but also stop slavery.

If Islam wanted to stop slavery it would not have allowed it in the first place.

&gt;Men who also neglect their wives in the bedrooms are also sinful.

But angels don't curse them lol and Muhammad didn't find the need to say something to that shows how Islam is tilted in the favour of men. A man can refuse sex to her wife and he won't be cursed by angels lol but the woman is. 
MISOGYNY AT ITS BEST.

&gt;Only from her father as her brother has to still share his wealth to her by law.

Yea, unequal inheritance. Thanks. Muslim women are protesting around the world for equal inheritance and yet you spit on their struggles like this.

&gt;Its over now and I hope you have a great day or night lol

Sure you too. ;)"
1963,f9fcsc7,"Because of misogyny and sexism and the current state of Islamic education. 

Also the learning model in Islam requires a close personal relationship with your teacher which some Muslim women and male teachers are not comfortable, with so Muslim women are discouraged from seeking knowledge and Muslim men discourage it too. 

At best, most Muslim women have the more distant type of learning available to them. But knowledge also requires spiritual mentorship and counseling of the individual. That’s why the greatest female scholar is Aisha RA she is the favorite wife of Prophet Muhammad and had a close intimate relationship with him. 

The solution is breaking down these barriers for women and helping build up female scholarship."
1964,f4ys56x,It’s hard to feel good about this when the whole reason why Muslim women are supposed to cover their hair is rooted in misogyny. 🤷‍♂️
1965,f6kpi6p,"Mehdi Hassan is a piece of shit. No argument there. Don't like Islam, make no apologies for it. But I'd flag that these shitheads found plenty of wiggle room when it came to alcohol, drugs, zina, iddat periods, various other bits and pieces of sharia. Seem to like porn just fine too. Funny that.

Afro-Caribbean women are beside the point here: [there aren't enough of them in Rotherham to make even a blip on the census](http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/yorkshire-and-the-humber/rotherham). It's not London. It's pretty white. 

Northern cities like Rotherham and the other cities where the gangs happened have quite a specific geography. Due to the history of coming to work in the mills followed by the post-industrial decline, you end up with entirely Muslim enclaves, brewing in their own microcultures, hostile to change (the parents of these men probably faced the National Front attacking them; that's vivid in my memories of the North of England back then.) Some of these enclaves proved to be hotbeds for radicalisation; some for this kind of rampant misogyny.

Muslim religious leaders have had their head up their arses forever. Up till this point, their main role in pissing me off has been denying that forced marriages or honour-based violence are a problem in their community. Who hasn't though, are BAMER women's organisations (Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic &amp; Refugee). There are many of these, often formed because the communities weren't addressing those issues of VAWG and because the authorities didn't know how to deal with them (or even, back in the day, if it was culturally appropriate to do so.) And they raised the alarm about these abuses too.

But here's where I disagree. 

&gt;Think of it this way- men's rights activists frequently cite cases of men being raped, either by other men or women, and trying to use those examples to claim that women are getting too much attention.

Muslim women are not men, and their rapes are not a distraction. Race has a role in almost all the rapes we know of (with the proviso that we don't know the size of the problem, and Muslim/South Asian girls who were raped may prefer to keep shtum rather than be married off to their buck-toothed cousin) - but misogyny has a role in them all. 

Your argument seems to be - and forgive me if I get you wrong - gang rape where the discourse is racialised misogyny is at the core of the problem; gang rape where the discourse is purely misogynistic is at the margin. But I want misogyny - women's shared oppression - at the centre."
1966,exesqmz,"No. you can't be a feminist and a muslim. That's a contradiction. I've heard these women who call themselves muslim feminists and they seem to harbour A LOT of internalized misogyny on top of being almost schizophrenic. They're complicit. I'm a woman and a feminist. I will call out misogyny wherever I see it.  I don't have any sort of ""privilege"" except the privilege of  being catcalled and harassed by Arabs and Turks in my country because I'm a white women which means I'm a prostitute. Such delicious privilege indeed. Muslim women are often in deep denial about their culture and often complicit, I don't see why we should only listen to them."
1967,eyssdwx,"We should try to remove misogyny, but we have to stay respectful to the women we are ""helping"". Claiming all Muslim women are brainwashed/without agency and not believing them when they say they want to wear hijabs is not good either. It's definitely a delicate issue, and I honestly don't know how best to solve it."
1968,es9bkrt,"Yeah, I guess you're right, the number is fewer than half a billion so it doesn't really matter about those who do wear it. I take back everything I've said. Clearly, my supposition that maybe some Islamic women are pressured into wearing the burqa is nothing but a sign of my own colossal dishonesty, misogyny and islamophobia at work. 

Sorry again, I promise, Thracc22, I'll never ever ever ever speak about the burqa again."

1970,evit0rq,"&gt;Proof?

Let's do Iran. Split tails have the pussy privilege of choosing to get married when they reach 18 years old. Males don't. Split tails can get a divorce if her husband doesn't give her free money. Males go to prison for not giving their wives free money. Split tails never do. Males can't. Men are obliged to give their ex wives free money after divorce. Split tails never pay maintenance. Also, all men are conscripted. No women are conscripted. Women who volunteer for military service are never ordered into combat. In 2105, Iran executed almost 1000 men. And four women. Split tails get pussy privilege in many, many other ways. 


&gt;They're Islamic nations and ffs, read the Koran to find out the pedophile prophet's views on women. 

Pedophile? Is that what your feminazi overlords at Jezebel.com told you to think? The Quran does not contain any of Muhammed's views on anything. The fact that you don't know that tells me (1) you've never read it, and (B) you're a blowhard. 

&gt;90% doomed automatically to hell,

Lol. The Quran does not say 90% of Muslim women are doomed to hell. It sorta says the opposite. You'd know that if you read it before you pretend to be an expert. 

&gt;domestic abuse is good 

You made that up. 

&gt;she gets 1/2 the share a male heir does

Uh. No. ""It is decreed that when death approaches, you shall write a will for the benefit of the parents and relatives, equitably. This is a duty upon the righteous."" When a split tail gets half share, it's because she has gotten and continues to get free money from a plethora of sources that men are not entitled to. You know what else it says? That her inheritance is hers alone, while a man's inheritance is family property. See? Pussy privilege. 

&gt;and her testimony is worth 1/4 in court of that of a male

You made that up, too. 

&gt;The reason they can't drive is because the freedom will make them wh*res. 

The Quran does not say women can't drive. 

&gt;Not denying America and the rest of the West have had issues, but damn if Islam isn't still full steam misogyny ahead.

You spelled ""misandry"" wrong."
1971,elke3l7,"Have you ever read the Bible? Are you aware that the biggest church in the world is famous for its misogyny? Like raping the nuns and children kind of male power? Are you aware that many men refuse to be served by or working with women inside the church as well as outside? What is it that makes it different from Islam? Seriously, tell me? The only difference I can see is the level of female emancipation and that's something we have to still fucking fight for. Nothing was given to women. This is the fight Muslim women are doing right at this moment, and it's still the fight Christian women are doing. I'm a church going Christian btw, and I know exactly how fucked up the system is."
1972,ekwi1cy,"Ok? That's what the Quran and hadiths say though. Unless Muslim women are denouncing the verses and ahadith that lay out the limits of women's rights, they are implicitly supporting Islam's misogyny by still being a part of it. Same with Christian women who aren't vocal about the shortcomings of their religion."
1973,e5kh7ng,"Your reasoning for segregation is that Muslim women are uncomfortable entering a mosque using the same entrance as muslim men?   Or praying for that matter.  Consider why that is.  

You know that black women weren't comfortable around white men.  The genders and races became more comfortable with each when they stopped being segregated.  

Are Christian women uncomfortable entering a church, or praying beside Christian men?  No.  The approach to gender is more equitable and mature - and as a result they have psychologically healthier relationships.  

Yet you defend segregation and an immature approach to the opposite sex.

You're ignoring the foundation for the misogyny inherent in Islam by taking cheap shots and (purposely?) misunderstanding the points being made.  Your entire approach is cheap and disingenuous.






 "
1974,e3wcorp,"D o you know how Muslim women are treated? LIKE FUCKING SHIT. I can't even argue this because I have known so many Muslim girls and women who have gone through the most abhorrent, vile shit ever...because they are women.
The Burka is a literal representation of their oppression. You really think they'd want to cover up all the time if there wasn't immense social pressure? 

I grew up in a nearly half Muslim area. I had many Muslim friend's. Don't tell me I don't fucking care. 3 girls in my tiny school underwent FGM. One girl was left in a random Pakistani airport all alone because her parents found out she had sex. We didn't see her again. 2 girls disappeared TO GET MARRIED AT 14. I saw the Muslim boys live life to the fullest, riding their bikes after school everyday, smoking and drinking with us when we got older. Not once did our female Muslim friend's come out with us. They weren't allowed. One was a twin and her twin brother could do whatever he wanted and she was punished for being minutes late. 

I'm 19 now and a lot of these girl's are now married. Arranged marriages to much older men. 
So do you know what? FUCK YOU. I can't believe you are someone's teacher. Because you don't give a flying fuck about Muslim women. 
I want my fellow women to have freedom and they don't have it, not even close. So maybe you're happy with devastating misogyny but I'm not. I think you're projecting. 

Tell me again I don't fucking care. Because I can assure you I care a lot fucking more than you ever will. I've been arguing against this since I was a 10 year old kid. Because interacting with Muslim girls and women was the first time I realised men and women weren't treated equally by everyone.

Have fun brainwashing Britain's youth, you utter cunt."
1975,dy4l29p,"Lauren is partisan hack and she like many other anti-Muslim haters would want to uphold us ‘ex-Muslims’ not because they care about us but because they use us as an excuse to extend their prejudice onto Muslims. She clearly shows prejudice and ignorance of Muslims when she says how all/most of the Muslim women are forced to say at home.

Nevertheless, these pseudo-feminists are easily triggered. They would rather campaign for feminism in the west rather than in the third world were women are treated trash there, most specifically many of them are majority Muslim countries. They would be happy to talk about the misogyny in the west and Christianity and probably whistle by the misogyny in Islam and east. 

Plus this hyper-intersectionality and pc identity politics within feminism and the left is harmful. Why should a Muslim women have to talk about Islam ffs? This is why Clinton lost the 2016 election because she was morally and ideologically bankrupt and only pushed identity politics. Identity politics is fine but if use it as your only weapon to win elections you alienate the majority. "
1976,dw0rafw,"I've already answered you above but again, I really don't think readers of a radfem sub are unaware that Islamic women are routinely the victims of religious and cultural misogyny.

1977,dveu4ez,"Boleh, as long as the polygamist isn’t my husband hahahaha *yawns*


Muslim women are allowed to have a prenuptial contract for their future husbands, btw. If you don’t want your husband to get another wife while he’s married to you, you can draw a contract. 

But it’s not really highlighted because MISOGYNY is rampant."
1978,dw0tujt,"It's untrue that the Muslim women stuck with these men are treated chivalrously. Their religion doesn't stop Muslim men from raping Muslim women and girls. They don't believe it's possible for men to rape their wives, so they do that without even considering it could be wrong. Muslim girls are subjected to FGM, child marriage, and other forms of torture as well. What happened here was clearly a crime motivated by religious, racial, and sexist hatred, but it's false to imply that Muslim women are protected from these men's hatred of women.  

Your point that we shouldn't focus on the larger picture of Muslim men's misogyny because it distracts from the details of these systemic crimes is one thing, and you have some good points, but I can't ignore the implication here that Muslim men treat Muslim women well. 

(*Not all Muslims, or whatever. Someone's going to accuse me of generalizing too much. These problems are found in other religions, but that's another conversation.)"
1979,dojumth,"It just seems like you feel much more morally obligated to tiptoe around these men that are compelling women to wear face coverings then I do. Honestly, the first thing that comes to mind is why are allowing people with these backwater views to enter a progressive country like Canada? Things like this ban confront and challenge these bad ideas, by forcing them to rethink their ill-advised convictions.  If one of these men has to choose between forcing his wife to stay inside, versus having food on the table? Attitudes will change quickly. 

Yes, you're right, they absolutely are a symbol of oppression and misogyny.  There is no other reason to wear these face coverings other then false claims of modesty and religious reasons. By wearing them, Muslim women are signalling to non-Muslims that the latter group is *not modest*. We're already seeing these trends in the UK where old-stock British are forced to dress more modestly in Muslim dominated neighbourhoods.

Rather than accommodate ourselves to death, I still think we should be forcing integration where cultures show no attempt to do so.

I'm also biased because I work in the identification industry, so the notion of being able to cover one's face flies against most of what my industry holds sacred in terms of security. "
1980,dkjowx3,"Dawkins is on the right side of history

*“The idea that I have engaged in abusive speech against Islam is preposterous, which even the most rudimentary fact-checking by KPFA would have made clear,” Dawkins is cited as saying in the press release. “I have indeed strongly condemned the misogyny, homophobia, and violence of Islamism, of which Muslims — particularly Muslim women — are the prime victims. I make no apologies for denouncing those oppressive cruelties, and I will continue to do so.”* "
1981,diftku3,"Woah ! Calm down a bit.    

My line of reasoning is this. Middle East and  Indian subcontinent societies are mostly misogynistic (This is a fact. Not my opinion/wish) with India being relatively less at it. 
In India , Muslim women are the most  underprivileged major block when it comes to victims of misogyny. 

I'm aware of the fact that ISRO's women scientists were instrumental for the success of Mars mission. They are an inspiring bunch of ladies. 

I'm sorry if I sounded sarcastic to you in my previous comment but  I honestly don't understand why you think I'm misogynistic and a bigot ! 
"
1982,diu9mq1,"What are you talking about?

1983,diw2508,"I've seen more non Muslim people complain about the way muslim women are treated than Muslim women themselves. In the islamic studies I went to from a very young age we were told heaven is beneath your mother's feet. That if she is truly upset and disapproving of your actions then you won't enter heaven without her blessing. We were taught to treat all women with respect and to protect them with our lives. I would die for my sister and my wife and would do everything in my power to give them a happy life. My father was very accepting and happy with my mother wanting to work, get a degree, drive her own car and just be a unit as parents. He would also be happy with her wanting to be a stay at home mum which she preferred. My parents enjoy the traditional roles and I see nothing wrong with that. I have never seen my dad lay a single finger on my mum and both my sister and mum defended the religion whenever i had questions about the treatment of women that people kept bringing up online. I know there's definitely more to it ad there are some middle eastern countries with horrendous misogyny but as a Muslim with Muslim friends I've never witnessed it first hand living in a western country. To me it has a more to do with culture than Islam.   "
1984,fyvlikr,"&gt; Again you seem to be missing the point, women within certain religious and cultural sects are told from a very young age that they are not the same as men. They can't play with boys. They have to wear certain clothes. They have to be accompanied by a male chaperone.

This is like...a thing in many cultures. Gender equality is something of a recent development in western culture and its still something thats being actively fought for. I am pro gender equality, but banning specific garments of a patriarchal culture does nothing to address the inequality at heart. If you wish to address gender equality, specifically gender equality among the Muslim community, add more outreach centers where women can go to in order to escape that lifestyle. Increase education and financial opportunities for Muslim women so they can have the financial resources to escape patriarchal households and live independently. Removing their choice for clothing does nothing to do that. 

&gt; Here's an example. If I started a social club today requiring women to dress a certain way on the premises whilst allowing men to do as they pleased. If I also created rules only for women and allowed men to come and go as they please. Do you honestly, seriously not think for one single second that I would face extreme public if not legal pressure to change? But under the guise of any religion its free reign to do what we want under the guise of ""culture""...

You can face all sorts of public backlash and its perfectly fine. Public backlash and legal action enforced by the government are 2 incredibly different things. Legal action has legal, state enforced consequences. Public backlash often times doesn't unless theres a legal precedent for it. I think if you're really so against Muslim communities/beliefs you can and should organize a boycott of their businesses and communities. You choosing to not involve yourself with muslims is entirely different than the government cracking down on their traditions. 

&gt; Of course there is a presupposition of coercion and mental conditioning that comes with certain religious garb. Have you ever seen a child or person without conditioning choose to wear something so clearly designed to separate them from the outside world and society upon general?

If thats the case, mandate school uniforms. Removing hijabs only targets one specific group. Removing the option for everyone is true equality. 

&gt; We have an age of consent in most countries tied towards a child's ability to do most things, personally I think religion should be part of that. If you truly believe there is no coercion, abuse or conditioning involved in any religion and it's treatment of women and children then I've got a bridge to sell you. I say that as someone who was in an incredibly irish Catholic upbringing both educationally and socially. The way that women, LBGT tolerance and other sections of society are viewed is most definitely not something I would describe as folerant or progressive.

A child is pretty much like a lump of clay. They have no idea of the scope of the world and probably has a very limited sense of nuance or direction. EVERY child is in someway sculpted by the culture or biases of their parents. Religious or not children are going to think and act like their caretakers, good or bad. Unless you can make an argument for freeing ALL kids from ""intolerant"" or ""regressive"" conditioning from their parents, specifically targeting Muslim households under the guise of tolerance is Islamophobic. 

You can also not be raised in a religious household of any sort and still be LGBT intolerant and support patriarchal gender roles. If those two issues are ones that you want to die on, thats perfectly fine. Support institutions and funding where LGBT people are accepted and give additional resources to women so they can financially and societally succeed. If you think that Muslim women are in need of those services, establish outreach in their communities. 

&gt; Ultimately this isn't about choice in general, this is about choice in school. Schools, like most civic buildings and places, should be free from religious idols, clothing etc. If for nothing other than to allow children as you say to truly engage with other cultures on an even basis and learn true tolerance to all, whilst also giving them the opportunity to truly choose whether they want to wear such garb in their social time outside of education.

So I'm going to assume that all religious iconography/clothing including crosses and yamulkes are already banned in public schools? Are there mandatory uniforms in place? Because those two actions doesn't explicitly favor or target any specific religion/group. Banning hijabs specifically targets Muslims."
1985,fus4kgc,"From what I've read in the Quran I don't think it specifically says that muslim women are not allowed to marry people of the book. In fact I feel like this one of the very few cases where a rule in Islam that gives people a bit more leeway specifically applies to both men and women in equal measure.

Al Baqarah contains, to my knowledge, the only verse that explicitly deals with this topic and it says, ""Do not marry idolatresses (al mushrikāt) till they believe; and certainly a believing maid is better than an idolatress even though she would please you; and do not marry idolaters (al Mushrikīn) till they believe (hata yūminū), and certainly a believing slave is better than an idolater, even though he would please you.""
Which seems to indicate that men are not given preferential treatment in this regard. Interesting because modern Muslims want to portray Islam as a feminist religion so fervently yet here they have the perfect chance to do that but yet they still stick with the unnecessarily patriarchal interpretation that is more down to scholarly consensus then actually being rooted in scripture."
1986,frfmzjw,"I just don't like it when regressive fucks from Tamil movie industry (or pretty much anyone in Tamil Nadu) do it. Especially when you target them for the wrong thing. If they showed them to be snobbish cunts, fine I get that - they deserve it. But patriarchal? Especially when many Brahmin women from the state are high achievers, while Tamil Muslim women are taking up Saudi style niqabs, there's something very wrong about that. Look at the OBC too. You hear about a honor killing once in a while, but it's the Brahmins who are patriarchal?"
1987,fizc0rg,"Actually, most people around me agree - none of us want to see gays thrown off of buildings, women forced into hijabs, or the state religion become Islam.  And the people like you, who think Islam is just any ol' religion, are laughed off as being too intellectually cowardly to say the right thing because it's politically incorrect.

I'm not angry, I'm not fearful, I'm not even hateful though considering what Muslims do to LGBTQ+ people and women I have every right to be.  I simply see them for what they are - patriarchal oppressors.

But no - I've spent enough time living in Toronto to see what happens when a neighbourhood's Muslim population goes up.  Attacks on Jews increase.  Non-Muslim women are harassed in the street.

The cause that needs to be addressed, is Muslim immigration.  Bring in people of any colour you like.  Bring in Sikhs, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, whatever.  But Islam is incompatible with western democratic society."

1989,exh2xzf,I think its important to note that not all muslim women are of the belief that muslim women need liberating from a definitively historical patriarchal fashion item.

Why am I linking the abuse that muslim women are living to a religion who has patriarchal ideology ? Because it’s linked as simple as that, as I said islam doesn't view women and men as equal beings, men are seen as superior to women, women have to give full obedience to their husbands, if they don't they are going to be punished.

Also there are a lot of hadith that are sahih who can confirm my views about this misogynistic religion, Muhammed said: “If I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone other than Allaah, I would have commanded women to prostrate to their husbands. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no woman can fulfil her duty towards Allaah until she fulfils her duty towards her husband. If he asks her for intimacy even if she is on her camel saddle, she should not refuse.” (source: Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1853; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.)   

this is equality to you ? 

What about this hadith by Bukhari :  If a husband calls his wife to his bed (to have sexual relation) and she refuses and causes him to sleep in anger, the angels will curse her till morning.” (Bukhari v.4, b.54, no.460).

this is equality to you ? 

“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allaah and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allaah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity and their husband’s property). As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them; but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great” 

is this equality to you ? 

Look you're spending your time trying to debate with me, Islam is abusive towards women and is a disgusting religion, I'm not going to change my mind because a random muslim, who is ok with abuse toward women, is talking to me about a subject that I've been studying since I've learned to read.

1994,enqzg6d,"Not sure why you're being downvoted because what you're saying is the truth. Also Muslim women are judged more on how modestly they dress, skin color (in desi culture especially), weight, virginity status, and once you get to \~25 most Muslim men aren't interested in you (i think this is changing but historically speaking). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying Muslim men don't have it hard. But the problems they are facing are due to the fact that Islam is a patriarchal religion. My non-Muslim classmates are totally okay dating guys with no money because it's more about the connection for them. In Islam, the man has to support the woman so this is what happens. I would be totally okay with getting rid of this aspect of Islam because I'm fine with marrying a man who can't support me if we get along well, but I feel like most Muslim men would see this as going against Islam. 

&amp;#x200B;

The men in this sub are more conservative than most, so your suggestions of non-Muslim women probably don't work for them. They don't want a girl who has slept with other guys or who wears mini skirts. Yeah it's superficial. But that's the majority of guys here. If they weren't so shallow, they might actually find a girl to marry in their early 20s but hey thats just my opinion."

1999,ebbnfy0,"You’re correct. I just have. It’s from Islamic thoughts. In the Islamic morals, Muslim men are allowed or even encouraged to marry with women of non-Islamic backgrounds and Muslim women should only marry Muslim men. Through this, Islam proliferates because this is a patriarchal society and the husband’s religion and culture is what dominates. Usually, children of Muslim men and alien women are still Muslims whereas children of alien men and Muslim women are not.

“You shouldn’t need to be an apostate to have a seat at the table [as a female Muslim]”


Ok, sure... but does Islam itself not raise a barrier in getting access to the candid political and religious thoughts of religious Muslim women living in a patriarchal Muslim family with a number of religious Muslim men?  ‘Obsession with the burka’ ok, I see the point, but there are some doctrinal reasons we do not hear directly from  many burka wearing Muslim women, are there not?   Isn’t that a significant part of the point?  It wouldnt make much sense to me to couch all the activists working to alleviate suffering in north korean as ""speaking FOR the north koreans"", afterall...

Well that’s where the racism comes in. It’s a complex issue precisely because brown people catch more criticism than white people for adhering to abrahamic religions. "
2004,dzqv6p4,"Here is my two cents. 

Firstly, there is this rule of Islam that their men are free to date whatever women they like and their women are only allowed to date Muslims. Of course, the more original version of this rule is that their men are allowed to marry Muslim, Christian, and Jewish women, and Muslim women are only allowed to marry Muslim men. There is a small deviation between this original rule and reality but apparently the second is much more emphasised. Quite many people in SE Asia aren’t in fact Muslims so can’t “date back”. 

Then, given that Islam is an Arab religion (and culture), and that the current world is a patriarchal one, the result is naturally that Arab men are culturally very advantaged in SE Asia. 

Plus, and few people like to acknowledge this fact, there is actually some biological reality to race. I mean, even though American culture is about whiteness, why do black men date white women much more than white men date black women? Biological features of Arab men, just like black men, are seen around the world as more masculine and attractive in general. The fact that Arab people are sort-of-white is also in line with what this subreddit is about.

The overall result is what you see. "
2005,dsa6wdy,"You think the majority Western women would give up their right to wear whatever they want and the right to question the men within their family or friends for a religion that caters to men's needs more than anything else? A religion that prefers the Arabic language and Arabs over any other language and people? Or their right to eat pork or drink alcohol or be bi-sexual or Asexual or gay without being labeled a heretic or a bad person for doing so? 

Most converts to Islam are not ""normal"" they are people that have serious issues in their life and feel that converting to Islam ""purifies"" or brings them closer to a divine being. While they can feel whatever they want. The vast majority of the Western world already can't stand Christianity's rules and doctrines and thus cling to Atheism or Agnosticism because they won't be condemned or made to feel shame for doing things that they enjoy doing.

Sorry but Islam certainly is not a religion that is very compatible with the Western lifestyle. Christianity has had to adapt and change in order to survive due the ever changing and liberalizing Western Lifestyle. If it didn't it would have lost all of its Western followers and the Vatican would have probably dwindled into obscurity. As its only remaining devout followers would be Latin Americans, some Africans and Asians. Islam's doctrine specifically states that it cannot be allowed to change or adapt in any way. Or it becomes corrupted hence why Islam's doctrine still holds 7th century values.

So to answer your comment some Muslim women are certainly not too happy about their predicament of living in a patriarchal society and religion. While many are ignorant to what the Western world is like. Once they get a taste of that independence it is hard to go back to a house where you cannot question your husband, brother or any male in the family and have to be quietly obedient due to being a woman. 

Women have fought hard for the rights they have today. Not too long ago western women were not allowed to vote and were forced to be just as obedient as Islamic women are today. Western women are not going to go back to that kind of society and certainly not for an Arabic religion.

2006,dw13061,"I am a Muslim and it is more of a cultural identity than a religious one.

a)Feminism is not male bashing. There is a misconception that it is so. Feminism is for equal rights for women and men. I agree there are some women who want special treatment for being women, those aren't feminists, they are just princesses without a backbone.
 
b)The concept of equal rights escapes a lot of practicing Muslims. If a woman wants to be under the subjugation of a man, and she does so willingly, I cannot possibly discourage her. I on the other hand demand respect and equality in all spaces of life- legal, economic, social and political.

c) I come from a liberal family. Abusing women is actively discouraged and in my part of the world, it is also penalised. Muslim women are subjects of a highly patriarchal society where one can get a reputation for talking to a man and can get killed for falling in love with one.

d)I will never condone regressive behaviour for the sake of upholding traditions. Every human being deserves a fair chance to live freely (within reasonable legal boundaries), and all the oppression that plagues the community will take a century or so to go.

e)All in all, women are equal to men. We deserve respect, education, legal rights and a say over who we marry.

2007,ducbhcy,"hey hun. i’m an arab muslim woman too and i have never heard of hymen surgery ever in my life.  if my mother would have come up to me and told me i had to do this surgery i don’t even know what i would do. 

firstly, a hymen doesn’t even mean virginity—i lost my hymen when i fell on the head of my bike when i was 11 years old. 

secondly i really believe that us as arab muslim women are at a real transition. i’m not sure where you are from, but in lebanon the women there are strong, independent, and rather die alone than be with someone who cares if they have a flap of skin covering their vagina. you gotta ask your self do you really want to marry someone and be with someone for the rest of your life that really cares if you were a virgin? would he be a virgin? how could you check if he was? you can’t. 

virginity and hymens were a product of a patriarchal society that wanted to control a woman’s sexuality. i’m not telling you what you should or shouldn’t do but really understand what YOU want for your future. you should read The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir.

2008,dp2d5z5,Muslim men are allowed to marry non-Muslims but Muslim women are not. Why? Probably because the assumption is -and this was probably a smart one in the patriarchal past- that the Muslim man will prevail. If not over the wife then at least the children.
2009,dnkd05u,"If you mean ""convince them Islamically,"" you're out of luck since Islamic fiqh and all the maddhabs are firmly in agreement that while Muslim men may marry women of the book, and enslave women of other religions, Muslim women are strictly confined to Muslim men. ~~Note that this is in no way patriarchal as Islam is the most feminist religion.~~"

2011,dlh5yre,"And so, now we have a situation where Muslim women are being forced into swimming in a segregated area due to their patriarchal and conservative interpretation of Islam, and yet, you do not only refuse to challenge it, you glorify and revel in it. This is the complement to the gentlemen's clubs."
2012,e3cp8h7,"No one complains about Saudi Arabia for the same shit and worse. So yes if you're not Muslim. Women are second class citizens but they aren't sexist. Non-Muslim can't be citizens and if you are shown not to be Muslim you can be inprisoned, deported and have your citizenship taken away but they aren't the second coming of hitler. 

Get your head out of your ass. The fact you're upset shows your bias. Me pointing out an obvious fact, that most people are afraid to criticize Islam for the same shit pisses you off? What's your point? That Israel should be more like Saudi and kick out anyone but jews? Excuse me for assuming your point but you can't seem to make one other than ironic statements.

""Do you actually read your own comments and think about it?"" Good to know your line of thinking is comment first and think about it later. Explains your comment and perceived point of view.

2013,dwjqxub,"You're being downvoted because a Muslim woman jumping ship and going after the western alpha male is seen as a defection from Team-Islam.  The Quaran is very explicit when a Muslim seeks an infidel mate.  She might as well be robbing a bank if she were in a muslim country doing this.

A veiled Muslim woman is risking a death penalty via Family honor-kill to even speak to an obvious infidel, doubly so in a flirtatious way.  Muslim women are property of men, and this little ship-jump is a tiny flame that needs to be fanned.  She's a traitor to her religion, and western civilization should hold her up as a template and model for other Muslim women.

If women can rebel against Islam, that's a mechanism of bringing those dirt savage killers up to a beautiful loyalty and love for all the trappings of American western civilization.  If she's unsalvagable you should still date, and if she has ties to ISIS and Islamic State, make sure her deportation papers are airtight before taking it to ICE for shipment back home where she can be happy under a Caliphate and Sharia Law."
2014,dkf0ji0,"honestly, the civilisational situation, and the long term forecast, is so dire I literally am beginning to think that women shouldn't work anymore and should stay at home to be traditional in their roles; muslim women are like this and this is partly how they are able to have so many children - because the mother isn't too busy. it's now actually becoming culturally justified. I believe fully in women';s rights, but I just think our culture that justifies women's rights in the first place is gradually fading away. 

obviously we can either have that^, or we deport all muslims. there are no ""liberal"" muslims, before anybody tells me that. islam can never be ""liberal"". that's like having a ""marxist capitalist"""

Tajikstan actually just switched from supporting detainment of Uighurs to condmning it due to their same ethnic heritage. Same with Pakistan but due to their shared belief in Islam. 22 other nations have also condemned these longterm detainment and mistreatments of Uighur Muslims.

Muslim women are indeed subject to greater potential punishment than muslim men, but in the west, the human rights of men are violated on a regular basis (I.e. due process, presumption of innocence, even habeas corpus) where a man can be detained , charged or even fully convicted on simply the word of a woman (Ex: Brian Banks case) , in fact all a woman has to do is just declare the man guilty of a crime and the life of said man , as he has known it, will be over.

Moreover, the vast majority of violence is targetted at men... and men are, let's just call it what it is, enslaved by state force to women that they were once associated with. I was legitimately surprised to read that men can be IMPRISONED for debts of this nature despite me , possibly naively thinking that the law would protect men in this regard, it doesn't.

Well said. There's probably also some fear that if Muslim women are able to gain power in the West then it could cast their own brand of ultra conservative Islam in a more unfavorable light.

2022,fo9c1eq,"I'm from Canada. Generally what I've seen is that most cultures don't really mix and if they do its not that common. For the most part your average pretty arab/desi (varies by group) etc. girl is 95% marrying within her culture (regardless of who she sleeps with- if anyone). While a girl's requirements for men of her own culture can seem unreasonable she's not exactly going to give them up for a 60k a year white guy unless they already knew each other and she brought her parents around to it. I'm going through this semi arranged process now. The vast majority of these families are waiting for a same culture doctor/engineer. The sort of families I've interacted with WANT their kids to marry a desi and while we appreciate fair skin its in the context of the same culture.

Agreed while white converts on average might give more tingles lets be real some of these guys are total neck beards and at least the ones who are genuine tend to skew very very conservative. At least in Canada I haven't seen or met many bosnian/white reverts apart from one dude. I think maybe some muslim women are open to it but at least for desi/arab cultures the pecking order in terms of racial preference goes your culture &gt; adjacent country/region &gt; arab/desi &gt; white etc. Keep in mind this is for marriage while for dating its more of a free for all. Even then desi girls and guys generally stick to their own."
2023,fh2v2az,"My wife would whoop your nasty bearded ass. Were at least confident enough to accept women with personnality.  Muslim women are good role models i bet, they act like beaten dogs with no sense of self worth.

2024,fh7yl5i,"&gt; Why does the fact that you converted to Islam matters when it comes to dating? Is it something that you'd say early into a relationship?

Well believing in a religion is a pretty big part of life, yes. It doesn't necessarily come up right away but I am upfront about it. It means I can't drink, can't eat pork (which is a surprisingly common ingredient in American and European food), can't do drugs, grow a beard, follow obligatory fasts, etc. It also means I wouldn't date a Hindu or Wiccan for example, though that's never really come up, but it works both ways since Atheists and Christians largely don't like Muslims, especially not dating us. The problem is Muslim women are especially uninterested in me so it pretty much leaves Christians or Jews for my potential dating pool."
2025,es8tuo3,"It is because of the culture and religion. Pakistanis are more religious than arabs these days. Plus there are a lot of non-muslim arabs whereas all of pakistan is pretty much muslim.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, in Islam, muslim women are only allowed to marry muslim men. A muslim man can marry a muslim, christian or jewish woman.

&amp;#x200B;

Also some cultures are a lot more strict. Bengalis are only allowed to marry other bengalis for example because of language.

Pakistanis are not eevn allowed to marry other pakistanis from a certain city/village/cast/ language. i.e. milpuris usually do not like punjabis and vice versa, so marrying a white guy is even worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Pakistani parents will understand other pakistani parents so will want to communicate with in laws relationships with inlaws are a big thing. they force their kids to not marry outside their cultures.

Same with bengalis but benglis are also marrying ouside more now.

&amp;#x200B;

My conclusion is that is is a mixture of how strict they are with religion, culture racism and language barriers. Arabs all speak arabic (even though there are slight differences) so they can marry other arabs from a different country and that expanded to marrying other cultures because the mindset was allowed to open.

&amp;#x200B;

Also i think pakistani women just like pakistani men because they usually are masculine , good with money and business and have that masculine bearded look a lot of women are into these days so they could just also be attracted to their own type. A lot of asians in general find white people a bit too bland. Asians also have this asian humour too that only asians will understand. And peopel tend to marry people that can provide what is familiar to them psychologically."
2026,eo4mwf0,"""If muslim women are women then why call them muslim women?""

""If red cars are cars, then why call them red cars?""

""If gay men are men, then why call them gay men?""

Surprisingly, adjectives modify nouns and don't negate the noun. Trans women are called trans because there are innate experiences attached to being trans that cis women don't experience. Same thing with gay folks - being gay isn't any negation of masculinity or femininity, it's a descriptor of experiences and opinions.

Similarly, you're an asshole transphobe is just a descriptor of who you are. It doesn't mean you're not a transphobe.

&amp;nbsp;

And, hot take on your ""besides"" point: gender is performative (see: voice pitches, how you identify someone wearing a dress, beards, etc. You don't know sense someone's chromosomes, you sense their performance in society). And as such, that means that someone identifying as a man *would* qualify them as a man. 

And: toasters are 1) not a performed gender, 2) don't hold relation and meaning in society other than being a toaster (There are no *toaster roles* like there are *gender roles*), and 3) probably should also be respected."

The issue is immodest and demonic feminism. There was a time when men were men, and women were women. Today, women, especially western women, have completely abandoned the modesty and virtue that God ordained for them. 


*”Do not let your adornment be merely outward—arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on fine apparel— rather let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God. For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose daughters you are if you do good and are not afraid with any terror.”

2031,e7y6csx,"&gt; I think you need an education...

&gt; Hassidic Jews FAMOUSLY have large families. In fact? They tend to have more than DOUBLE the size of families of most Muslims who tend to have 2-3 kids (Unlike our 1-2 kids which is the big fucking problem you have here). Apparently the average is 8... Which means they are more likely to eventually outnumber Muslims... You know... if things worked the way you imply they do.

I beg to differ:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Jews#Demographics

British Jewish population in 1882: 46,000 

British Jewish population in 2001: 266,740

British Jewish population in 2011: 269,568

I don't know how many of them are Hasids but clearly that it a slow growth rate regardless of what flavour of Jew we're talking about.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom#Demographics

British Muslim population in 1961: 50,000

British Muslim population in 2001: 1,600,000

British Muslim population in 2011: 2,706,000

The 1991, 2001, and 2011 censuses have each shown a 1.7x greater Muslim population in England and Wales than the census ten years earlier showed. This is far faster growth than the rest of the population, curving strongly upwards, while the rest of the country has been on a low gradient. It looks like we'll see a similar increase in the 2021 census and if that 1.7x trend holds steady for another three censuses after that, i.e. roughly the same amount of time that it has already been established, that extrapolates to roughly 23,000,000 by 2050. Jewish and Muslim population growths are two very different situations.

 &gt; And you literally just tip toed around their customs. They have their own areas. They have their own nursing homes and carers. They even have their own ambulance service. They have arranged marriages. And their women are expected into subservient roles and effectively ostracised if they fancy anyone not ""real Jewish"". I have seen more Muslim women at work than I have seen Hassidic Jewish women. In fact Muslim women in work are a rising force with rapidly increasing employment.

I don't know what your point is supposed to be here, do you think I'll think it's less fucked up if a Hasid family forces their girls into bin bags? And do you think the rest of the country would prefer that if there were enough Jews here  for the country to notice it? It only doesn't matter because there are only enough Jews in the country to fill a few football stadia.

&gt; Or what. It's only acceptable to target Asians because you know if you targeted Jews it would be a lot fucking harder to defend your racism. 

Fuck off. Point out exactly where I said or implied anything that was racist. I enjoy this part, this question has been ignored every single time I've asked it and I've lost count of how many times I've had to ask it at this point. This is how it always goes, I say something less than positive relating to that which we must not criticise, I get called a racist. Come on and be the first to back it up. 

&gt; Fuck mate. Most Muslims speak English. I have had to treat some Jewish people who explicitly do not speak English.
bitch about people speaking Hebrew as much as I hear you bitch when I speak Hindi or Tamil. The only Muslims I have met who don't speak English are tourists or are visiting family here.

You haven't heard me at all other than this conversation, I'm not any ""lot"". That ""you lot"" comment  says it all, although I shouldn't be surprised by the assumptions people are so quick to make on this sub at this point. And I don't know why we're now talking about who can speak English better, I haven't said a word about that.

&gt; So what? Muslim women are magically going to give up the Niqab solely because some wanker who was born with a silver fucking spoon in his mouth says it's ridiculous? Fuck mate! You aren't going to ""fix"" this problem by being this twat. There's plenty of women in Islam flying the flag for not wearing the Niqab who know this isn't helping.

No, obviously not ""solely"" because of him saying that. But this country is largely scared shitless about speaking honestly when it comes to this religion and I don't need to spell out the effect (or non-effect) of that. Compare that to Christianity which is dead in this country now, because of people ridiculing it and telling the ugly truths about it a lot for ages.

&gt; AND I dress like you. I still fucking face racism from people for that. It's fucking moronic because even if we jumped through all the damn hoops you expect us to you won't treat us equally anyways.

Me? Who am I treating unequally? Who do you imagine I am?  Actually this is me exercising equal treatment, being as critical as I would be towards anyone. This is precisely why people tiptoe, holding everyone to the same standards makes accusations of racism, bigotry and whatever else are inevitable. Which is especially interesting in a case like this because Boris's comments were actually quite tame, school playground-level stuff. I mean, come on. Letter boxes, bank robbers, sounds like the observations you'd hear coming out of an 8 year old.

&gt; It's racism. If you are selecting people for bigotry based on their ethnicity it's racism. I am Asian. Ex-Hindu. We face anti-Muslim bigotry all the time. Famously from when the EDL destroyed shops owned by Patels in the early days when people thought they were Just anti-Muslim. If your idea about Muslims is ""Brown Person"" then it's racism that drives your distaste for ""us"". Islamophobia is intrinsically tied in with racism.

No, if they're doing or saying something because they think you're a Muslim it makes no difference whether they think you're one because you look like one from your skin, or from your clothing, or facial hair or name or whatever else. Would you be calling it  clothesism or beardism or whatever then? Of course not. The assumption that you're a Muslim because you're brown might be an unintelligent bit of stereotyping but if they aren't saying things relating to your brownness then sorry, no, racism isn't the right word."
2032,drfcql5,"Um... no, he was asking a question. You're the one that's implying that muslim women are known for having beards."
2033,fqba6jy,"A protective face mask, a winter scarf are not religious symbols, but have a function, which is why they are allowed.

A Muslim veil is 100% a religious symbol and serves no other purpose.

By the way, Muslim women are still allowed to wear their veils, headscarves and what have you. As long as they are not serving a public office while they are wearing it."
2034,frudgmv,"7:26
&gt;[O children of Adam! We have indeed sent down to you clothing to cover your shame, and (clothing) for beauty and clothing that guards (against evil), that is the best. This is of the communications of Allah that they may be mindful.](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=7&amp;verse=26)

Both men and women are required to cover their parts that are deemed to be shameful/private, and both men and women hold the capacity to display beauty.

If a woman's hair is shameful or private, then it does not make sense for that hair to be displayed to the woman's husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess, or those male attendants having no physical desire, or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women. 

24:31 which was referenced literally refers to *""children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women.""* Children are very much aware of the hair on women's head because they've seen it on their mother's and sister's head, therefore a child's mother's hair is neither shameful nor private. 

24:31

&gt;to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests

Right. Headscarves to be covering their chest, not scarves covering their head. I mentioned earlier how hijabs have been part of Arab culture 3,000 years before Islam, for practical purposes concerning the environment.  So every woman should cover their chest with the headscarves that they already own. No where in that verse does it claim that women should cover their head. The conditions of that statement is reversed in your comment.

If I said every football player on the team has scored 3 goals, that does not mean that scoring 3 goals is sufficient to join the football team. That's just saying that everyone on the football team has scored 3 goals.

24:31 is saying that the headscarves should be used to cover a woman's chest, not that the fabric covering a woman's chest should cover their head. 

Now, one might argue that a woman's head should be covered unless they're in the company of their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess, or those male attendants having no physical desire, *or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women.*

However, as I mentioned earlier, every single child has seen their mother's hair and are aware of women's hair and head. Children stop being breastfed before they're able to formulate lasting memories and constructive thought. Bosoms must be covered, but if hair must also be covered then zero children would have ever see their mother's, sister's, aunt's, or grandmother's hair. 

In Saudi Arabia, the nation whose government claims to represent Islam, women can remove head coverings in their home, but if a body part is displayed to that mother's children and family, how can that body part be considered private? Saudi mothers have children who've seen their hair regularly. None have children who have seen their mother's genitalia or breasts (at a age capable of significant memory).

The lustful and sexual physical connections that men and women engage in are among the relationship of genitalia and breasts, not hair or head. 

TL;DR: Every single religion is interpretative to the believer. If one considers a woman's hair to be shameful and private and not of beauty then they can keep believing that. But don't say that Muslim women are wrong or failing to fulfill Islam for not covering their head because of *your* personal interpretation of the Qur'an."
2035,fj95za9,"(ok it’s late for me so i’m gonna kinda just ramble bear with me)

i’ll admit i’ve always had a bit of doublethink situation when it comes to stuff like this. everyone should be able to do, say, wear, whatever but then at the same time i think people need to be aware of the history/cultural meaning behind the things they do, say, wear. if only muslim women are supposed to wear hijabs, niqabs, burqas, and other specific head covering garments, then can other people wear headscarves? or only certain kinds? 

i guess the best answer i’ve been able to come up with is, a genuine question never hurts and to not assume there is one answer that covers all situations. (and if someone gets offended at a genuine question, they’re a fuckin asshat)

i also 10000% agree with the last bit you said. education is the best way to brig everyone together."
2036,f364l68,"I am talking from my singular perspective as a brown woman from a country that has a 95%+ Muslim majority, and having moved to the west as an adult. I see this as problematic for the same reason a white woman wearing dreads is problematic. There are plenty of examples of white men and women wearing dreads for what I can only assume is for the purposes of fashion, but that doesn’t make it any less culturally appropriative. Hell, even a k-pop star got into trouble for imitating dreads in a recent music video. 

The reason I use dreads as an example is that black cultural oppression is widely understood in the west. The same level of understanding does not seem to extend to Muslim cultures. While head coverings may have existed for millennia, it is undeniably used as a tool of oppression in modern society. There’s a banning of headscarves in France and the Burqa ban in Netherlands. Legalities aside, a brown woman is treated completely differently on the bus and in the shops when they wear head coverings vs when they don’t. My friend from Maldives decided to stop wearing head coverings because she felt that people were not listening to her at conferences while she was doing her STEM PhD. As a brown woman, the more you assimilate yourself with white culture the more you are accepted into western society. 

The line between religious head coverings and fashionable head coverings are also blurry. Many women wear head coverings not because they are devoutly religious but because it is the norm in their culture. Indeed so many Muslim women are freaking fashionable with their head coverings ([like this HBS professor](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=952941) ). I personally feel that it’s theirs to play with cause they have most probably faced microaggression because of it. 

The idea that one can use their race or class privilege to ‘normalise’ a foreign or exotic cultural element in itself if plenty orientalist. No you do not need anybody’s permission to wear any sorts of head coverings. But that doesn’t mean that it’s not offensive, and intending no harm does not equate actually doing no harm. White volunteers in Africa do not intend harm, yet they feed into a harmful narrative of white supremacy and colonialism. 

Your appetite for being politically correct may be different, and you can do whatever you please. Some people don’t tread as carefully as others. I just hope you are aware that it wouldn’t be wholly unreasonable if someone was offended by it."

Yes he does. Did you not read the thing you quoted? He specifically makes the claim that all islamic countries oppress women like Iran does. 

&gt;He did not. He mentioned Islamic law.

There is no islamic law. There is Iranian law, there is Turkish law, there is Jordanian law etc. He says all muslims live under some islamic law that he imagines and that any muslim who violated this imagined islam law will be arrested in any country.

That's racism.

&gt;It's a religious law which countries incorporate in order to indoctrinate, brainwash its population and violate international human rights. Keep strawmanning.

You mean like how NZ law incorporates christian doctrine? 

&gt;You have pointed out countries where muslim women are practising the incorrect and watered down version of islam. 

I have pointed out where muslim women do not wear headscarves and are not arrested. This counters your narrative all muslims will arrest women who do not wear headscarves.

*Reading about a white woman who has a book coming out next year: 'How to wear a headscarf' - 'the headscarf is the ultimate accessory, functional and chic.' The need for people of colour in editorial positions is so fucking overdue. It makes me shake that Muslim women are being violently attacked and set on fire for wearing headscarves while some white woman is getting a major book deal appropriating weak-arse, watered-down versions of Muslim, brown and black culture and traditions.*

She's kind of missing that non-muslim women wear headscarves too. Claiming appropriation of Muslim traditions is silly. "
2040,e5chsfw,"&gt;  in muslim cultures it seems to cover the entire female form

In *some* Muslim cultures.  This is the point I think you keep missing.  There is more to the Muslim world than the repressive Middle Eastern cultures Breitbart and Fox News seem to focus on.

Men have a biological drive to notice attractive women, and that can extend to any display of female traits.  Therefore, everything, including a woman's face, *can* be sexualized in a culture if it's something not normally visible.  Different cultures draw that line in different places.

&gt; more and more muslim women are coming out with relaxed coverings, more interest into fashion, this interest comes from both hijabis and non-hijabis, i see the hijabi fashion as a good thing that will gradually normalize femininity in public as it is coming from the more mainstream section of the society.

Yes, in some areas, the culture is changing.  The words written in the Koran didn't change.  I think this is a good thing in that women are now given increased agency over their choices to wear what they want.

&gt; we should find other solutions than hiding women

Great, let's hear them.  In the mean time if women choose to solve this problem by conforming to their community's social norms regarding what parts of their body they should not expose in public, I support their choice to do that.

I think every argument you're making here against wearing headscarves can be made in western cultures against wearing bikinis.  That exposed breasts and genitals is the line we choose to draw around ""decency"" doesn't mean it's objectively the correct place to draw it.  It's cultural.  We should stop trying to force our standards of decency onto other cultures.

&gt; can you bring me one living christian that believe that women should cover their hair in public ?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_headcovering

&gt; Although the head covering was practiced by most Christian women until the latter part of the 20th century,[4] it is now a minority practice among contemporary Christians in the West, though it continues to be the normal practice in other parts of the world, such as Russia, Ukraine, India, Pakistan, and South Korea.

http://amishamerica.com/why-do-amish-women-cover-their-hair/

&gt; you go in a muslim country in prior to the 70s you see muslim women wearing all forms of clothing, this ended when islamists came

I am not suggesting that culture cannot be changed through force.  Again, the words of the Koran didn't change when this happened; a *culture* (based in large part on a group's *interpretation* of a religion) was forced onto the people there.  We shouldn't tolerate that happening.  But now that it's happened, we're at the point where cultural norms *have* changed; if you oust the Islamists, the community isn't going to flip overnight to apply western standards of decency.  If you accept that people find an exposed face to be indecent, forcing them to expose their faces is akin to forcing women to go naked at the beach, even if you can point to an oppressive religious interpretation as the reason why their culture came to draw this line of decency where it did."
2041,e247vyn,"The muslim women are objectively crippled intellectually by force. They get sent to jail for protesting headscarves and for dancing in their room. The ones that escape the programming of course. The others are sadly molded to think it is normal. Then the plasticity and ability to change goes away and they move to the US, meet stupid leftist women and twist their view on headscarves even more and affect societies that welcome them.

The idea of a person coming from oppression and supporting policies that oppress them isn't new. "
2042,duykup0,"Those women are getting that for not wearing a scarf. North American women are getting it for walking down the street. What's the difference? In fact, I'd go so far as to say that abiding by their culture's rules (that many, if not most, believe in, by the way) keeps them safer. Abiding by cultural norms doesn't protect North American women. 

I understand what you're saying. However, the universality of violence against women is why the example of violence against women who don't wear headscarves as an example of why Islam is more oppressive/violent than any other culture/society doesn't really work. Yes, women muslim women are attacked for not wearing headscarves. I'm not arguing with you regarding that. North American women are attacked regularly. What's the difference? You can't say Islam is particularly oppressive/violent when violence against women - *regardless of the reason* - is not particular to Islam. "

2044,dn8vdly,"A lot of people claim that when Muslims (e.g. Arabic, Levantine, Egyptian etc) move to Canada or America, they are the 'progressive' types and take part in none of the bad shit from the Muslim faith. When in reality, most 1st and 2nd generational homes have heavily male-centric households and carried over traditions that are harmful to a persons independence (such as the headscarf).

A lot of people wear headscarves, but I believe at least a sizable amount of Muslim women are somewhat forced to wear it. As an anecdotal example: I knew a Lebanese girl who was born in Canada, but whose parents only arrived a few years before her birth. We talked casually at work until I asked why she wears the headscarf, she said the typical 'its part of my customs' stuff - but I asked when did she start wearing it. She said since she was a kid, and that she didn't really like wearing it as a kid but 'grew used to it'. 

Take that however you want, but it really seemed to me like a case of getting used to something sucky. A girl shouldn't like to keep herself nearly permanently covered up because its 'shameful'."
2045,dl4tsw3,"&gt; You conflated headscarves and burkas. 

No I didn't, I spoke about each separately. I was very careful to make this distinction, as well as the distinction between choosing to be covered and being forced to. I wonder if I should start counting how many times I repeat myself on this point..?

&gt; Is this a thing you do? You're doing it again. That's hyperbole. That's exaggeration. 

I am truly sorry if I was not clear enough. I feel like I was, but I will do my best to clarify further. I said, if you have a scenario where half a population is forced into being covered, that's obviously not a healthy situation. This occurs to varying degrees across the world - in many places there is little to no force involved. In others, it is enforced by law. Is that better? 

&gt; You're gaslighting me.

No I'm sorry, you are simply misunderstanding me on a fundamental level. I suspect you're doing this because you're looking for the worst possible interpretation of each and everything thing I say, either consciously or unconsciously. I know you already have a view of me that's deeply negative and wildly inaccurate, and I think it's tainting how you're reading my words. That's why I humbly suggested applying the principle of charity - it helps both of us.

&gt; An overwhelming majority of China, Russia, El Salvador, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, Uganda and Kenya believes homosexuality is immoral. 

Yes, it's terrible isn't it. 

&gt; I haven't said it's fine or that beliefs don't matter. 

Ok, well as long as we agree that beliefs can impact actions, then we're on the same page, and we can move on to discussing the degree to which this negatively impacts societies.

&gt; I have asked for evidence. 

Each time I've done this you've just ignored it or dismissed it out of hand :/

&gt; Forced face coverings of half the population, you must agree, are not conducive to a flourishing society.

&gt; What is this supposed to be?

A statement of fact - do you not agree that forced face coverings of half the population would not be conducive to a flourishing society? 

Notice how nowhere in my statement is the assertion that 'all Muslim women are forced to have their faces covered'. It says nothing of the sort. How are you not seeing that?

&gt; Read the Pali Canon sometime before you make these absurd claims that Buddhism is philosophy, not religion. 

I'd rather just sort out a working definition for the purposes of this discussion with you if it's all the same. The important thing isn't to get the definition exactly right, rather, it's to settle on something that functions for our argumentative purposes.

&gt; The evidence is about belief, not action,

Which is why we need to discuss the connection between beliefs and actions. Also, I have provided some evidence of action too, so.

2046,dl5gwe8,"&gt; I spoke about each separately. I was very careful to make this distinction

You may believe you were, but I assure you, you were not, since headscarves aren't burkas.

&gt;I am truly sorry if I was not clear enough.

I accept your apology. You must be clear in what you say, and that includes specificity: what harm we are talking about, who is purportedly harmed, who is harmed more and where they are harmed, who is doing the harming, and the causes of their harmful actions. Hence why I continue to ask you to show me the evidence comparing harm under 'Muslim countries' and 'non-Muslim countries' (to make an almost absurd distinction) to women and homosexuals so that we can make an informed inference as to who is being harmed more and what is the cause of the harm (is it 'Islam' or something more proximate?). Providing me evidence solely of the beliefs in 'Muslim countries' just doesn't cut it.

&gt;it's terrible isn't it.

It is, but I'm not going to claim that *Christianity* is responsible for this terrible state of affairs.

&gt;you've just ignored it or dismissed it out of hand :/

I have done neither of those things, but rather addressed how it *on its own* doesn't provide evidence for your claim.

&gt;do you not agree that forced face coverings of half the population would not be conducive to a flourishing society?

But that's not what we're talking about, as shown in the example I gave of smears on bagels: smears on bagels aren't bad, but *spitting in* smear is bad; similarly, headscarves *per se* aren't bad, and insinuating that all women that wear headscarves are *forced* to wear headscarves is barmy.

&gt;Notice how nowhere in my statement is the assertion that 'all Muslim women are forced to have their faces covered'. It says nothing of the sort. How are you not seeing that?

It's called an implicature--why else bring up something irrelevant to the conversation? It's also horrible to force people to eat M&amp;Ms!

&gt;The important thing isn't to get the definition exactly right, rather, it's to settle on something that functions for our argumentative purposes.

I would think accounting for the fourth-largest religion would be important, as well as denominations in more Western religions, such as Unitarian Universalists. Hence my focus on social practice.

2047,dig0zum,"&gt;Except your family won't disown you for refusing to wear a shirt

There are two assumptions here that are wrong, let's break them down one by one.

1) Muslim women are disowned for not wearing headscarves. This is true *sometimes*. This is true of *some Muslims*, in *some places*, and even *in those places* it can vary from family to family. I live in a *highly* Muslim area, and it's about 50/50 what their women will wear. Generally speaking, the older women prefer scarves, the younger women wear nothing or sometimes a very very light scarf. So, your response here is a scare tactic.

2) In other cultures, people are not disowned for their clothing choices.  Please tell me how well it goes over in the US when a transwoman starts wearing womens clothing, or when a transman starts wearing mens clothing. Please tell me how well it would go over if a person decided to become a nudist and refused to wear clothing in public. Please tell me how well women are treated when they choose to go shirtless. 

On both fronts, your throwaway statement fails, but also encapsulates the huge amount of bias we have when speaking of these types of issues. "
2048,diu486k,"&gt; The issue, and it appears you're failing to grasp the core problem here, is that many Muslim women are not given that choice.

Many Muslim women are indeed not given that choice. But you want to take away the choice from those that have it. 

We've got three options here:

1. Force women to wear headscarves
2. Force women not to wear headscarves
3. Allow women to wear or not wear headscarves, according to their preference. 

I'm picking 3. You're picking 2.

And you're ""fascinated"" why feminists in particular would pick option 3 over you — a man, I'll bet — telling women what they can and can't wear... 

&gt; How does a Western society effectively prevent that?

A western society which doesn't have a tradition of forcing people to wear or not wear certain clothes, carries on not forcing people wear or not wear certain clothes. Because anything else is failing to respect individual choice. 

If you want to argue for a law which prevents anyone forcing women to cover their hair/faces/bodies, and can think of a practical way of drafting it, I'd support you.

We're talking about a religion that explicitly has punishments in place for homosexuality, compared to a religion that literally does not mention homosexuality at all. The simplest explanation for this disparity in beliefs is a disparity in scripture that directly corresponds with said beliefs. If you want to argue that this isn't the reason, you should have a pretty strong basis for that argument - I think you'll find it very difficult to come up with an explanation that is more compelling than ""one religion instructs its followers to kill homosexuals whereas the other one doesn't"".

I can only assume that you're working backwards from modern incarnations of sectarian Christianity and assuming that whatever cultural beliefs and practices are produced from these many different sects are somehow inherent to Christianity.

Islam does indeed teach that women should be treated with gentleness and respect by their husbands, however the precondition for such consideration is that they accept their subordinate position. 66% of Iranian women experience domestic violence in their first year of marriage, according to a report conducted in 28 regional capital cities by Iran’s own Interior Ministry. In 2013, Human Rights Watch estimated that 85% of Afghan women suffer domestic violence. An association of NGO’s reported that 80% of Pakistani women experience domestic violence.  A Domestic Violence Protection law has been rejected twice by the Pakistani parliament, with various organisations angrily denouncing the measure as “anti-Islamic” and an attempt to promote “Western cultural values”… And so it goes on. Reports on various Islamic countries by bodies such as the WHO, the UN and HRW suggest that between a third and two thirds of women in the Islamic world are victims of domestic abuse. r
r
Sad to say, beatings, domestic servitude and social marginalisation are not the worst abuse to which Muslim women are liable to be subjected. Female genital mutilation is an almost exclusively Islamic practice, which UNICEF estimates has been inflicted on some 200m living victims. Consider that number for a moment: it exceeds the entire female population of North America, and is nearly equal to the entire female population of Europe. This particular barbarity is praised as “noble"" in several of the Hadith (that is, the sayings attributed to Muhammed), and though a matter of choice for most Muslim parents, is viewed as mandatory within the Shafi’i branch of Sunni Islam.r

2058,fcvfapr,"I'm late, but I'll share my thoughts if you're interested...

So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard.

But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand...""* (Sahih Translation- [Quran - 4:34)](https://quran.com/4/34)

So says the above Quranic verse used to justify hitting women. [But it's not that simple](https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Wife_Beating_in_Islam). Despite Muslims proclaiming the Quran as 'perfect' and 'clear', the reality is the Quran is imperfect and ambiguous - indeed to the point that the supposed words of this 'infallible deity' often requires fallible, subjective, human clarification via hadtiths (supposed sayings of Muhammad), tafsirs (commentaries on the Quran) and scholarly interpretations (which often vary). All often resulting in disputes amongst Muslims themselves on what 'True Islam' really says about issue X, Y, Z. Hence the various interpretations amongst Muslims. 

Not wanting to portray their 'wisdom for all humanity' as permitting domestic abuse. Allot of modern Muslims today *clarify* the 'perfect' and 'clear' words of their unsubstantiated deity, as really meaning to 'hit' or 'tap' or 'poke' ('lightly') with a 'miswaak or toothbrush'. Essentially reducing the nature of what seems to promote an aggressive and violent verse, into a condescending and comical one.

Bearing in mind, the application of this verse to 'discipline' one's wife, is a last resort and it is to be applied if the husband subjectively 'fears disobedience', not if she's actually disobedient. Not to forget theirs an unsubstantiated assumption, that it's the wife, who's always or often in the wrong and not the husband: thus no divine guidelines on how to beat your husband. Not that the Quran was ever good a guide, what with the often fallible human subjective interpretations. 

Nor is there any governing official to regulate, lest the 'striking' or 'tapping' or 'poking' with your 'hand, misaawk or toothbrush', gets out of hand. Nor is there any mention of 'light hitting or poking a wife with a miswaak or toothbrush' in the Quran - the Islamic deity's supposed 'perfect and clear guide for all humanity'. This additional material is a product of fallible, subjective, human authored interpretations, from hadiths, tafsirs and various Muslim scholars. 

Now ask yourself, do you think this is the best way to resolve marital disputes? Via, at Islam's worst interpretation - proceeding to an aggressive and violent 'strike/hit/beat' a poor wife? Do you think this will make a wife loyal and loving to her husband? Or, at Islam's best interpretation - proceed to condescend an adult woman via 'lightly hitting, tapping or poking with your hand, miswak or toothbrush'? Do you think this will make a wife (all of a sudden) loyal and loving to her husband? Or is it more likely to piss her off, to think her husband thinks so low of her, that she could only be reasoned via a tap with a toothbrush? Or is that just the nature of Muslim women, that inferior in intellect to non-Muslim women?

Are Muslim women not humans, not adults, not capable of emotion and reason? Can they not feel? Can they not be engaged in a mature, clear and thoughtful conversation/interaction with no resort to violence or condescension? Can they not be reasoned with? Are they simple minded animals? (inferior to men - as the above Quranic verse implies and various Islamic restrictions on women's rights and opportunities and modern Muslim apologetics confirm) Is that the message you really wish to give yourself and your children? A world where women, their rights, opportunities and existence are restricted and condescended because of her gender, rather than on their individual competency and characteristics.

As with most claims of Islam, there's no evidence marital or any social disputes for the matter are best resolved through violence (via striking) or the ridiculous condescension (via tapping or poking) a wife or some other individual in dispute, with a toothbrush. If anything, you'll still probably exacerbate the dispute, via the toothbrush method. 

It doesn't take a genius to know this. But all the evidence points, that the best way to resolve any dispute, let alone marital - after perhaps taking a break from the heat of the moment - is to participate in calm, clear and constructive discussion regarding what the problems are and for both to work towards a mutually agreed upon solution. **A last resort should be relationship counselling via a professional or family and friends, not Islam's ambiguous wife beating.**

Satire of modern Muslim apologetics on wife beating...

&gt;['How to beat your wife (with love)](https://youtu.be/yZUIPiVoxgw)"
2059,fd4rvtl,"&gt;You seem to be a typical Pakistani

Yes I'm Pakistani and I'd appreciate it if you kept this discussion more civil and on topic. Calm down and don't get so emotional. 

&gt;Why is it that girls from minority communities in Pakistan routinely ‘elope’ with muslim men but never the other way round?

If you would read my comment carefully, you would see that I stated that these forced conversions *do* happen, it just doesn't seem like this particular case is an instance of that. As for the other way around, it's because Muslim women are not allowed to marry non-Muslim men in Islam. You can whine about that all you want, but that's just how it is. 

&gt;The Parents of the girl said their daughter was abducted and forcibly converted and married off, are they Indian agents?

The daughter herself stated publicly that she was marrying this guy of her own will. Maybe she's being forced to say that, or maybe her parents can't accept that. I don't know for certain because I'm not there to find out, but the girl's statement meant the police can't take her into custody. I never said anything about her family being Indian agents, that's your own imagination. 

Yes nice Dawn article. It says about 700 Christian and 300 Hindu women were forced to marry in 2015. That is 700 and 300 too much, however my point was that it's not *thousands* every year. If thousands of Sikh girls were getting abducted every year like I've heard some people claim, there wouldn't be any Sikhs left in Pakistan by now.

The rest of your comment is just a weird tangent about things I never said anything about. I never claimed Pakistan doesn't have an issue with religious extremism, I never claimed everything is an Indian conspiracy. I did say that Indian media and some Indian nationalists are using this unfortunate event for their own propaganda, not that the event didn't happen or that everyone involved in the event was an ""Indian agent."" And I drew the comparison between this event in Pakistan and the ongoing violence in India to point out how retards at subreddits like bakchodi or Indiaspeaks think this event means Pakistan is worse than India in treating minorities. The official response condemning the mob in Pakistan versus the government support *towards* mobs in India show that Pakistan is moving in the right direction, while we can't say the same for India."
2060,f7iea71,"Partition violence is fairly known around the world, but with the blame put on Muslims entirely, and abuses against Muslim women are not discussed, but abuse against non Muslim women is highlighted in reference to partition. Jammu massacres of Muslims on the other hand is completely ignored and nobody knows about it. Gujarat massacres of Muslims is surprisingly not known as much as it should be but every single incident of alleged forced conversion (if it happened, i strongly oppose it and can never ever attempt justifying it) in Pakistan is highlighted and spread around the world. India is shown as a very accepting and tolerant country known for yoga, Mughal cuisine passed off as gangetic hindu cuisine, monuments built by Muslims but being claimed by Hindus, modern ""India"" being the sole successor to the united subcontinent lmao and being the ""India"" mentioned throughout history while Pakistan is just a ""new country"". And we have over a billion obsessed gangetic critters willing to spread lies."
2061,f9qyfox,"The [christian](https://shiloh-project.group.shef.ac.uk/sexual-violence-and-rape-culture-in-the-new-testament/)and [hebrew bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_the_Hebrew_Bible) also encourage oppressive disrespect of women. It's not unique to any one religion, it's just a product of older times when people were less developed/civilized than we are now. Every study shows that financial desperation is the primary driver of sex trafficking. That's why this sort of thing happens all over the world, regardless of religion in the region. I agree some of the worst examples of abuse of women take place in Muslim countries but singling Islam out ignores much of the issue while also alienating many people who would be allies in the fight for equality for women, many muslim women are fighting for equality (a famous example being [Malala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malala_Yousafzai)) and your comment puts them in the same bucket as sex traffickers. I just think it's better to have as many allies as you can in taking down the actual horrendous stuff and ensuring we stay committed to respecting people's religious beliefs so long as they aren't violating other people's rights."
2062,f79rruh,"\&gt; And, I feel like western liberal feminism totally forgets honor killings are a thing, and not that uncommon. 

Oh god, this is one of my pet peeves and I am so embarrassed as a Westerner for how many lib fems address this. They all dismiss it as ""AWFUL! Simply AWFUL! Misogynistic as FUCK! But we have the same thing in the west, we just don't call it that. Men kill their wives here and we only call it honor violence when Muslim men do it. It's not a separate phenomenon."" 

This is factually incorrect. Men in the west kill their wives out of selfish ego, but not to restore family honor. In fact, if a man's family finds out he's about to do it, they usually try to stop him to prevent imprisonment and family disgrace. No Western dude gets a call from his uncle warning him to kill his own daughter mercifully or he'll do it himself slowly. It's very much a cultural thing and Muslim women are the primary victims. The way we Westerners dismiss that for woke points is heartless."
2063,f2o7t26,"Muslim women are being subjected to honor killings, acid attacks, forced marriages, high rates of domestic violence + sexual harassment with little being seriously done about it yet you guys are here worried about ""islamic feminism"". Many of you guys can't even manage the basic duty of providing enough on a single income what a joke some people here are."
2064,eyw1sfe,"In some Islamic teachings the supremacy of the man is the will of Allah. Hence women are inferior to men, their testimony is equal to only half that of the man and women may not conserve with men except her father, or her brother. 

The majority of Muslim women are brought up with the conviction that it is Allah’s command for them to be under male dominance and their fates are interwoven with that of men.

No offense to my muslim friends (there are actually a whole lot of Muslim kind hearted souls out there) but unfortunately this mindset is embedded in some sick twisted mind of some Muslims. This does not only happen in Brunei. All over the world, there are higher incidences of Muslims involved in the violence or rape of their wives, sisters and daughters."
2065,eu2n6ei,"That would be a valid point if women had any choice in the matter. In most cases, even American Muslim women are not given a choice. They're forced into it before they can even think for themselves and they face violence or disownment if they don't want to do it. You guys have to look at this objectively or you're letting Trump cultists make valid points. There's a way to have an honest discussion about flaws of Islam without demonizing actual Muslims."
2066,ewmhrrn,"I’m not sure what you are saying. Muslim women are a non-Jews, and inciting violence is not refraining from violence. 

So the conditional statement I presented above applies. The solution is to ban non-Jews from the site."

2069,eduvmzf,"Neither does anecdotal fantasizing about how well it's all going without any source whatsoever.

Canada is like anywhere else: Muslim women are being beaten and violently repressed, are often too afraid to speak about it and are in complete denial that this violence is a result of religious doctrine inculcating men with quranic and clerical justification for battery, molestation and psychological terror.

&gt; The International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women brought together groups of women from the Muslim community as well as agencies like the YWCA to talk about domestic abuse in Calgary on Saturday. 

Jawaria Shoaib is with Islamic Circle of North America Sisters, the group hosting this event. Although it's still a sensitive topic in her culture, she says necessary conversations are happening more often.

&gt; ""There is a lot of fear within the Muslim community, which is acting as a barrier from them to come out and meet with other people as well. But ... we are taking our own baby steps and just to support them to come up and speak up,"" she said. 

&gt; Shoaib said one of the challenges is the amount of propaganda that ties violence to Islam. 

&gt; ""If you really want to help women who are suffering violence, please do not link this with their religion, because religion is important to them,"" she said.

I sense a blindness to the malice of religion in the same way Catholic communities kept covering up for pederasts.

There is a Wikipedia page on the subject, but here, too, the level of skittish whitewashing, tut-tutting and use of euphemisms is gut-wrenching, as well as constant abdication of responsibility regarding the role of Islam as causal factor in the very culture some insider critics say should be viewed as completely distinct.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_domestic_violence

You can continue to spin tall tales about your fantastic ""vetting"" which will somehow keep an (reportedly apostate) woman like this safe from retaliation and violent retribution, but this time your liberal naivete might cause direct physical harm. 

That is where common sense people from any political persuasion have to draw the line and stop the PC madness."
2070,e75fi45,"&gt; And statistically speaking there's absolutely no reason to imply that muslim women are in any more danger from the men in their lives than any other woman is in danger from the men in her life, unless your goal is simply to slander a religion with unfounded accusations of domestic abuse. 

That's a unique defense you've tabled. It's not that cultural pressure to wear certain clothing to suit male demands, it's fully blown domestic abuse! And we cannot possibly imply that Islam has more domestic abuse than other religious traditions, can we?

Or, we can get real and accept that cultural pressure is on a continuum, and the vast majority of it amounts to coercion, and falls below the line of actual domestic violence, and your argument is, thus, invalid. Even though coercion falls below outright violence, it still means that choice is not freely made. Is it 'violence' if they will be shunned by their family and social group if they opt out? If they will lose friends if they do? If they rebel against their parents, who have had them in that garb from a very young age, and face parental discipline over it? 

If we can accept that child brides in obscure sects of Mormonism have little to no say in their outcomes, even though they don't face outright violence the vast majority of the time, we can accept that other religious traditions limit and control women without resorting to violence, as well.

2071,e1d1urw,"&gt; free

Your society isn't very free if you are telling people what they can and cannot wear.

As difficult as it may be to fathom this, some people choose to dress this way. And why not? All clothing is descended from social function and norms. It isn't like we are born with clothes. So why is this considered repressive but wearing jeans isn't? Both make about as much sense in a natural context.

And you can say ""it is repressive because their husbands make them wear it,"" but I am pretty sure that forcing your wife to wear certain clothing is probably already illegal, or at least the behavior needed to force someone to do it (such as threatening violence) would be considered illegal. That doesn't mean that it doesn't happen, but there are already laws against it and the problem in that case is enforcement. If Muslim women are being forced to wear this by their husbands or by their culture, then we should offer them support groups who can shelter them and give them safety, and give them the tools to be independent. Banning this is only a band-aid solution, and I don't accept the argument that it is for security purposes. This is about culture, and we all know it."
2072,e2qk8v1,"Bullshit in the 1000^(th) degree.  *Some* things in the Quran aren't meant literally, but a lot of them are.  Consider the following:

* [In this hadith](https://sunnah.com/muslim/29/43), Muhammad commands some Jews to revive stoning; they quit doing, but he says ""No, you're supposed to take that shit literally.""  That narration even mentions that the [verses in *Surat Al-Ma'idah*](https://quran.com/5/44-47) about how people who don't follow the laws of Allah literally are wrongdoers, disbelievers, etc.
* [In this hadith](https://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/101), we see that the wife-beating verse *absolutely* meant *hitting your wife*.  Muhammad says ""don't,"" Umar says ""but our wives are being bitches,"" so Muhammad says ""ok"" and then **overnight**, domestic violence became a problem for Muslim women, and it has never ceased.  Mo's weak response (""they are not the best among you"") is now the norm.
* For another example of not giving a shit about domestic violence, consider [this story](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/77/42) where a woman is being *beaten green* by her husband.  Aisha laments that Muslim women are being treated worse than any other women in the world, and tries to help this girl ask Muhammad to grant a divorce.  He doesn't.  Because Islam gave women their rights.

And while, yes, probably not every single word of the Quran is meant to be taken literally, when *everything* is figurative, maybe it's just because everything is dumb.  Browse through [Bukhari's book of medicine](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/76) for examples.  Also gotta love [the one where Muhammad says](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/9/14) seasons are caused by Hell breathing (because Hell complained of being too hot ::facepalm::)."

&gt;What do you think is wrong Muslims? Is the religion bad in your view, or is it cultures

A combination of things.

-Culture. Muslims are taught non-Muslim women are fine to rape or assault. I'd be glad to show you quotes from the Quran.

-Repressive culture. If you have never been to Sweden I can vouch that the women are beautiful. If you come from a repressive culture where women are covered, and move to land of the blondes where they take their shirts off in summer, you might go a little crazy (see below).

-Local brainwashing. Sweden in particular has been feminized. Violence is NEVER the answer. Someone is assaulting your family, violence is NEVER the answer. Someone is beating the shit out of you. Violence is NEVER the answer. They have become the perfect victims

-Toddler syndrome. You bring in young males (see below) who push the envelope and what do you do? Nothing. Today he grabs a girl's ass in class. Nothing happens. Tomorrow its boobs. Nothing happens. Rape must be OK. To a large extent they (Swedes) are doing this to themselves

-100 + years of IQ testing and causality shows there is a zone of violence of around IQ 85. Young men, ages 15-30 are the ones who do most of the violence. Bringing in that demographic exactly (15-30 year old young men with average 85ish IQ) is literally the highest risk group to commit violence there is.

Yes I know these are generalizations, but overall they apply to Sweden 2018."
2074,e0ui8me,"&gt; it seems the Quran's has a certain tone &amp; speaks with certainty and conviction.

It does.  It is *extremely* insistent that it is true, and that the worst thing you can ever do is not agree with it.  This, however, obviously doesn't make it true, nor does it support its truth in any real way.

&gt; Also the text comes across as having quite a strong understanding of the human behavior.

Nah.  There's a couple places where it answers potential objections in interesting ways, but it really *doesn't* cut deeply into what people are like or what they need.  For example, when [the wife-beating verse](https://quran.com/4/34) came down, domestic violence [became a problem overnight](https://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/101).  Subsequent generations have tried to whitewash that verse and the surrounding hadiths to no avail; therefore, I would say the Qur'an gave shit advice, and Muslim women are lucky to be born among or married to men whose human natures exceeding that assumed by the Qur'an.

I'll ""offer my thoughts"" by paraphrasing these arguments in ways that shows their shallowness.

&gt; And if We had made it a non-Arabic Qur'an, they would have said, ""Why are its verses not explained in detail [in our language]? Is it a foreign [recitation] and an Arab [messenger]?"" Say, ""It is, for those who believe, a guidance and cure."" And those who do not believe - in their ears is deafness, and it is upon them blindness. Those are being called from a distant place. (41:44)

""Oh, they don't like the Qur'an in Arabic?  Well, if it *wasn't* in Arabic, they wouldn't like it either.  Which is dumb, because the Qur'an is awesome, and if they don't believe in it, they're just stupid.""

&gt; To him [alone] is attributed knowledge of the Hour. And fruits emerge not from their coverings nor does a female conceive or give birth except with His knowledge. And the Day He will call to them, ""Where are My 'partners'?"" they will say, ""We announce to You that there is [no longer] among us any witness [to that].""  And lost from them will be those they were invoking before, and they will be certain that they have no place of escape.  (41:47-48)

""Only God can know about my untestable claim of a future Day of Judgment.  But like -- how can it *not* be true?  Fruit just like...  comes out of trees, man.  And animals do the same shit.  Obviously *my* abstract explanation for these things is correct, and if you conceive any other explanation -- however equally plausible and unfalsifiable it may be -- one day you're going to get fucked up. 
 Because justice."""
2075,dyytl43,"They are liberal in that the majority of Muslim women are able to freely become educated, drive, and have successful careers, unlike the women of the much stricter nations like Saudi and Sudan. Regarding Shari law, it's important to understand that that doesn't mean cutting everyone's had off. There are 5 major interpretations of Islamic law, each resulting in their own jurisprudence. Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali, and Ja'fari. The groups like Boko Haram in Nigreria, for example, act out the strictest versions of sharia because they use the Hanboli fiqh. Sharia can be fucking terrifying. But it doesn't have to be. Many fiqhs of Sharia are based around individual discretion or non-muslim law(western) (hanafi), particularly in Turkey and central Asia. Shafi'i fihq is common in Malaysa. Sharia can be terrifying, but it doesn't automatically mean everyone loses their hands for theft, and it's important to understand it's all in the humans interpretation or fihq. 

To your point about sex outside marriage and drinking wine. Most conservative Muslims believe adultry includes all sex outside marriage. I have Muslim friends waiting till marriage because to them, and the Quran, all sex outside of marriage is forbidden. Drinking wine is also a hudud, or a crime with fixed punishment in both the Qur'an and Hadiths. Muslims all over the world do not drink if they are more conservative. There a 5 hududs (greatest offenses) in Islam. Drinking and sex outside marriage are 2 of them, to Muslims all over the world. Not just Indonesia. 

I'm not arguing that there isnt fundamental issues with Islam, particularly in the strong conservative states like Sudan and Saudi, but simple percentages dont tell the whole story. Like I said, I know American born muslims who dont drink and have sex simply because they are Muslim. It sounds very conservative to the west, but in many places that's just the norm. That's why we should take those percentages at face value. Some, like the last one about violence is alarming. We both said it was a small minority, but a small minority of 200 million is still way too many, like you said. But many of those percentages aren't anything unusual about muslims in general. It's all relative on location, and the fiqh of Sharia. If you find what fiqh they use/would use for Sharia, you'll get a sense of what law or punishment would be used. Admittedly, I do not know what Indonesian muslims would use. My guess would be Shafi or hanafi but I really dont know. 

I also want you to know I'm not arguing with you in anyway. It's good to have discussions about important matters."

2078,dsl53c7,"judging by your response i can tell its useless talking to you, you're one of those blind people who always hide behind the question ""do you have statistics?"", just so they can turn a blind eye to whats happening .... well, you don't have statistics on how many muslim women are getting harassed in the middle east, just because there are no statistics doesn't mean it doesn't happen, not every single thing in life is measured and recorded by statistics, do you seriously think that all men who have been abused by women will report domestic violence, therefore the 1 out of every 10 is the real number ?? men who say they were abused by women will be laughed at and told to ""man up""



if you bind reality and falsehood to statistics, then there are statistics on paternity fraud, statistics on false rape accusations, statistics on child support falling on fathers while mothers get custody of children, obviously but you know what, forget it, obviously you're too blind to see it, i already said it, male feminists (or those who think like them) are a lost cause, so please do us both a favor and stop replying"
2079,dqcmacs,"The problem is that women face public harassment at a rate that men just don’t. Why should we spend equal time on both issues if one issue is 10 times bigger? Spousal violence is an issue which disproportionately affects women. Why should we spend equal time on both men and women if spousal violence against women is a problem that is 10 tines bigger.

How would you feel about a religious freedom campaign in 1930s germany which spent 95% of its budget on Christians and 5% of its budget on jews? (Which would be equal representation)

How would you feel about a solving the problem that muslim women are not treated as equals by their husbands by spending 90% of your budget in areas where there are just christians?

Now I am not saying we should ignore the issues that men face. I am saying we should treat the problems proportionally. If 30% of the spousal abuse is against men and 70% is against women then we should also spend 30/70 on men/women, not 50/50. The gender distribution is 50/50. The problem distribution is almost never 50/50.

2080,drdm5p1,"&gt; it's likely because some Muslim women in Europe who come from some of the more conservative communities don't expect to be taken seriously

Are you saying married Muslim women are must subject to domestic violence than their non-Muslim counterparts? why wouldn't the authority ""not believe them""? "
2081,dphlbpq,"As a Sikh of Indian origin I am well aware of the diveririty of Islamic jurisprudence but don't lie on reddit as if no one is going to call you out on it and use smoke and mirrors to deny the very simple fact that in Islam Muslim women are forbidden to marry non-Muslim men whilst Muslim men are given the green light to marry Jewish and Christian women.

There is a reason you always hear of Hindu women marrying Muslim men in cases that are brought up by the 'Love Jihad' brigade: because Muslim women who do the same the other way around are subject to outright violence and excommunicated from their families and communities.

Congrats on the PR job though!"
2082,dq0lqnv,"I know a fair bit about both religions, I've read both their holy texts. The Bible and the Quran are undoubtedly open to interpretation in some areas but the Quran is pretty black and white when it comes to owning women and killing non-believers. That's not to say there's no violence or sexism in the Bible but Christian women aren't forced to wear hijabs, owned by their husbands to the extent that Muslim women are or disallowed to leave their husband. Certainly discouraged but modern day Christians don't commit acts of terror and that's for 2 reasons: 1, Christianity is just less violent. While it has it's moments, it doesn't encourage people to kill those who don't believe and the Bible doesn't promise everlasting rewards for doing so and 2, the religious as a whole is moved on from the old testament, which is where 80% of Christian violence is rooted.

The two religions are very comparable, just if you compare them you'll find that Islam is a much more violent religion inherently based on much more violent principles.

"
2083,dnz9kkd,"Many people have this perception of the violent muslim men and the submissive women. That is only half the story. 

Islam will not survive without strong female support. Many muslim women are actually more fundamentalist than their men and they know how to work the system to their benefit. 

There are lot of cucks in islam where the wife and mother in law basically treat the husband like a slave and use religion to get him submit. And if that does not work they are not above inciting violence from their father and brothers...

2084,dmjjbbp,"Do you understand that Christians, like everyone else have a great diversity of culture, politics, and religious flavors? Of urban and rural, educated and uneducated populations? And by the way, you should really read up on what happens to gays and women in Muslim majority countries dude, you don't know how good we have it. I'm not talking about Muslim Americans, I'm talking about Islam on a global scale. majority of muslim women are illiterate and Sharia law is morally wrong. So if Muslims can worship as they please, so can everyone else. All you have to do is look to see Islamic violence, it has caused about 800 million deaths in history. You do realise atheists are persecuted and killed for not believing that barbaric religion. Muhammad raped a little girl, their prophet. Why can't you see how terrible it is? They literally call for killing infidels, it is a warmongering cult. By the way, your anecdotal, virtue signaling is not evidence. They don't follow their beliefs if they are tolerant and liberal. If you were truly an atheist, you would stand up against Islam. I assure you that whatever happened in the name of Christianity does not compare to what the human rights violations that Islam had in human history."
2085,dn6x4v9,No. Id fight for muslim women in the USA. Muslim women are the last batch of women who need real feminism. Minnesota wont vote against female genital mutilation. Those laws are not our laws. I wont have shariah or islamic violence of any kind against anyone here.
2086,diy18g5,"&gt;data points would be nice on this one.

There has been a growth in more conservative Islam fueled largely by Saudi Arabia. If you're looking for quantitative data points, I'm sorry to disappoint you, they don't exist. Every country has different ways have collecting data. France's numbers have to be estimated, because they aren't allowed to do a census on religious practices. If you want to get an idea though, look at how western Muslims answer questions on human rights issues. There is a troubling amount of support for Sharia law among British muslims, and the majority of british muslims think homosexuality should be illegal. Forget gay marriage they think being gay should be a crime.

If you are unfamiliar with the rise of the Wahhabi ideology, this one is a good idea of how it's being financed and spread.

I'd be interested in your article on Sweden.

&gt;I don't actually disagree that it took to the 20th century for integration to occur, but that largest wave of migrants occurred from 1880's onward, which was only a few generations away from the mid 20th century.

There were whole cities in the US, where German was the main language and they had German language newspapers ect. There were whole pockets in American society that were foreign. That all disappeared around WWI. You could make the case that these groups were still integrated back then, as many of them had taken mainstream American jobs in civil service, ect., but assimilation happened later. 

&gt;which was helped along by the fact that most irish immigrants were not catholic 

Well if your a protestant that speaks english it's certainly easier to pass, however I don't think this was the case, and I didn't see that in the article either. Children of protestant irish immigrants born in America were never immigrants themselves. That fact that the majority of Irish Americans today are protestants and not Catholics could be related to the rate of natural growth &amp; availability of catholic churches in the colonial era. All this tells me is that more Irish protestants moved in the early history of the US, but as far as raw numbers of immigrants I doubt they would outnumber the catholic irish. 

&gt;the melting pot is false in it's standard portrayal but immitegration also seems to happen much faster than you are portraying.

I don't doubt that people can integrate. Even if you look at Europe there is a lot of genetic diversity that wouldn't be apparent just by speaking with people.  The question is what factors led to this integration. Why did some people integrate so well you can't even tell them from the 'locals'? There are populations of German Danes, that you couldn't tell they were Danish by looking at them, hearing them, or seeing their names. The famous General Von Moltke was one of these germanized Danes, and most Germans wouldn't even realize they had any foreign ancestry. Same goes for germanized Poles. There are quite a few of them, from different eras, the current Chancellor of Germany is an example of one. Most Germans and Europeans just see her as German. 

If I had to make a quick theory as why these groups fit in so well, I'd say the two main factors are service in the military (drafted) and interracial marriage. In this case I mean race as in ethnicity. The issue we have today, is most western countries don't have a draft, and there is a culture in Islamic society that still sees women as commodities. The more conservative sects don't want their daughters dating western men, and will often find them a nice muslim man for the right price. 

Additionally threats of violence and honor killings further limit islamic women's choices. Islamic men are free to date whomever they want, but quite often the girl will need to either be a muslim or convert to be acceptable to the family.

So we have some huge stumbling blocks ahead of us on the road to integration, and even with third generation muslims in the west, there is a chasm between their western counterparts. The same cannot be said of the immigrants of European or East Asian background living in the west

2087,dkt2twi,"Canada already has laws on the books to protect women from violence and coercion. All you are doing is sending the message that Muslim women are unwanted in Quebec. This makes them less likely to seek social services or, or f they need it, police aid. 

Don't couch your dislike of Muslims with feminism. It's insulting. "
2088,dk3e87h,"I'm not convinced this isn't Islamophobia. There's a ton of research that show that both sexes, but girls especially, benefit from sex segregation in school. Many private, elite schools are sex segregated as a result of this belief. Generally speaking, Muslim women are better educated than their western peers.  
As for books condoning violence, give me a Bible, ten random novels written by men, or a song catalog of 90's rock and I'll find multiple examples of this in each one."
2089,dk9l9wj,"If you have read the Quran, sunnah and hadith then you should know that violence against women is contradictory to Islamic teachings. You should also be aware that Islam stands for the empowerment of women as taught by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

Islam also granted economic rights to women fourteen centuries ago, establishing for women the ability to own, keep, and manage their own property and wealth, to seek divorce, to remarry, to inherit, and to ensure their own economic independence. The Holy Prophet Muhammad’ssa first wife, Khadijah(ra), owned and operated her own thriving trade business.

While Islam urges both sexes to dress modestly and guard their eyes, women are enjoined to cover their heads and wear an outer garment to conceal their beauty from strangers. Her dress encourages society to focus on her intellectual merit rather than her physical characteristics. Contrary to some assumptions, Muslim women are active in every sphere of life and are among the most educated women in the world. There are Muslim female heads of state, doctors, lawyers, journalists, engineers, as well as mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters. Therefore, true Islam recognizes the equity and equality of women.

2090,dixw83w,"ah! thanks. when conversations are this slow I lose some context. 

To answer your question: if one person refuses to integrate, that sucks, but mostly for them. They'll continue to feel pressured until they change their mind. If an entire group of people refuses to integrate, that sucks for everyone *around* them. It's also easier to reach out to individuals, and individuals have to reach out to what's available to avoid loneliness/isolation.

Large groups on the other hand can form their own communities, which basically become enclaves of the culture and philosophy of their origin country--bringing all the problems of that country to ours and clashing strongly with the native culture and philosophy. We see this happening all over Europe right now where the *unassimilated* Muslim population has grown large enough that in some places non-muslim women are followed or accosted in public just for being out alone or not wearing something on their heads.

Muslim communities seem to create the largest conflicts, but they're not alone in creating these types of enclaves. Orthodox Jewish enclaves are another example of this happening. Fortunately their fundamentalists are much less prone to indiscriminate violence, but people who walk through their communities are sometimes accosted as well if they don't fit into Jewish mores. 

But to return to my original point: *everyone* always has to rebuild/reintegrate in a new place. *everyone* has to work to maintain those relationships as long as they live somewhere. I'm sorry it feels difficult. I'm sorry if it feels more difficult for you specifically. But the benefit of integration is the maintenance of the culture that got the country to the where it is today. People move here because of the success and opportunity they see here, but refusing to integrate is rejecting the philosophy that made this the place they wanted to move to in the first place."

**As BJP breaches Muslim vote bank, secular parties lose their core constituency** 

 ______ 
In a Facebook interview with the Hindustan Times, UP health minister Siddharth Nath Singh had said in a lighter vein, ‘Some Muslim women said they voted for me as they liked the dimples on my cheeks.’

But it’s more than the dimples. The reports coming in from different corners of the state indicated a softening of the Muslims stance towards the Bharatiya Janata Party, the party that had become an anathema for the community after the 1992 demolition of Babri mosque in Ayodhya and 2002 riots in Gujarat. Since then the community ruthlessly voted to defeat the BJP.

It could well be a judicious move by the Muslims who have now realised the political potency of the BJP, both at the state and the centre. A Muslim BJP leader, who has stuck to the party despite the anger of the community opines, “The 2017 mandate has changed their mindset. People, who till the other day avoided meeting me have started sending invitations.”

The Shias came on board first and now some Sunnis may also explore the saffron party despite its subtle thrust on the Hindutva agenda.

The All India Shia Personal Law Board has explicitly supported all the three controversial moves of UP chief minister Yogi Adiyanath – a negotiated settlement of the Ayodhya dispute, a ban on triple talaq and cow slaughter, the third literally breaking the financial backbone of the community notwithstanding. Some of them had even celebrated the BJP’s victory and Samajwadi Party’s defeat as ‘yaun-e-nijjat’ (day of riddance).

The 8% Shias have generally toed a different line from the Sunnis.

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has however rejected government interference in matters of Muslim personal laws and an out -of-court settlement of the Ayodhya dispute.

Although the AIMPLB has strongly censured the social practice of triple talaq and called for social boycott of those who misused it, Muslim women are increasingly veering to the government’s stand to end the humiliating practice.

It is not a small achievement for the party that had not fielded even a single Muslim candidate, both in the Lok Sabha and the UP Assembly elections, for the simple reason that their Muslim candidate would not have been able to muster support of his own community, especially when the BSP had fielded 100 Muslims and the SP and the Congress had stitched an alliance to retain their support.

What seems to have worked for the BJP is its commitment to the social problem that Muslim women are facing – triple talaq, which they could not oppose out of fear of earning the wrath of the maulanas and their men folk.

Tamil Nadu has a unique system of jamaats, affiliated to the local moque, which settle domestic issues like dowry, divorce and domestic violence. But there was a time when most of the jamaats neither had a woman member on the board nor did they allow them to represent their own cases and thus delivered one-sided judgments that favoured men. I remember meeting women’s rights activist Sherifa Khanum in the mid-1990s. After years of demonstrations she had succeeded in forming women jamaats to deliver justice to the battered women. The maulanas relented after public pressure.

Not everywhere in the country can a Muslim woman get her petition redressed. Thus when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah decided to incorporate triple talaq in their election’s sankalp patra, Muslim women started hoping for some succour from talaqs given on phone, mail or verbally. Maulanas resisted the BJP’s promise but a fraction of women gave silent support to the party they had despised. The three other political parties – SP, BSP and Congress which are partly dependent on maulanas support in the elections – had never ever thought of touching the sensitive issue even with a barge pole.

However, public pressure is growing. Armed with government support, more and more women are challenging their husband’s unilateral decisions and taking to the streets. It’s quite likely the maulanas may also be compelled to adopt a more conciliatory approach.

Ironically, a few Muslim organisations and individuals have come out openly in support of the ban on cow-slaughter, with some even promising to invade minority dominated areas where cows are slaughtered. Interestingly, they are also getting the support from their own community.

A few months before the elections, triple talaq, yoga in school curriculum and cow slaughter were seen as polarising issues in the elections. No more, much to the consternation of the secular parties. With the BJP penetrating the minority vote bank, howsoever minuscule, and the majority community resisting minority appeasement, it’s time they change their political narrative to come back in the electoral competition.

2094,fkyap5p,"i can assure you that you're totally right. i came from a muslim country and the only happy women are either those that were brainwashed into believing that having a non-violent husband is already enough, those who left the country by studying extremely hard like my self to get a scolarship aboard and i can tell how much sacrifices it cose me to be as free i am now, or the women that were lucky enough to get a hot caring romantic husband with a good head on his shoulders and that doesn't oppress them but trust me getting a guy like that (especially in a muslim country) is like WINNING THE LOTTERY. ALL the uni students in muslim countries work their asses off so they can go away, especially women, because if you stay you either choose to marry young and if you don't you will be considered a failure and a disgrass unless you're a surgeon who was born in an open minded family. muslim women ARE NO WHERE as happy as american women. the only muslim middle eastern and north african men that respect women are extremely rare and they're most likely to be against the traditions of their home countries. the worse is that some women are pressured to be succesful AND traditional at the same time; which mean providing and doing ALL the housework, to prov how worthy they are"

I mean if the fact that the religion was started by a violent, lying, psychopathic peadophile and that Muslim women are worth half as much as a Muslim man, that non-Muslims are to be killed and enslaved is not enough for people to give up their belief in Islam then there must be a stronger bond keeping them in the faith.

2099,el48dkj,"&gt;But problems with integration do not mean 'overrun.'

I don't like this language either. Not just because of the demagoguery, but because its inaccurate. This isn't an organized army coming to Europe trying to outpopulate us and then seeking to exterminate us. This for the most part is just families moving over for a better life, and then wanting big families like they had back home.

&gt;The latter is clearly a quantitative argument, a fear of being swamped by numbers.

This is a qualitative issue not a quantitative issue. If Chinese people or Americans were moving to Europe in large numbers we wouldn't be looking at the demographic ticker and wondering when WWIII was going to start. 

There are serious concerns with muslims, because Islam is a particularly violent religion, because they are dissuaded from integrating, because muslim women are still forced to marry within the faith, and because 4 after generations of Turks living in Germany they haven't learned the first thing about democracy and how to maintain republic.

Third of all, Islam has so many violent verses be it in the Qur'an or hadith (beating your wife if she disobeys you, killing apostates, killing homosexuals...

Also, stop generalising and assuming ""all Muslim women are ok with covering their faces"" because that's shitty and dishonest, there's a shit ton of people women who have gotten in trouble just for refusing to cover their faces (whether their Muslim or live in a Muslim country) and assuming they're all just ok with it is insulting towards the struggles people had to go through because of your religion.

That doesn't mean that negative opinions, or rational arguments against race mixing can't exist, does it? Scientifically and culturally, freedom to marry or not to marry someone can still have large scale statistical effects (like Muslim men being allowed to collect kafir women and claim their kids for Islam, while the Muslim women are not; or mixed race people not having a historic bond to one or both of their parents' ethnic groups). Have you a counterargument to any of these videos beside virtue signaling hysteria? Being against race mixing for a white person only seems like Nazism if you already support a plan to ethnically cleanse the West of its historical and present demographic state, of its white peoples and their unique in-group preferences and interests ([like the ones the Jews have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gvKW6-zW6M&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=444), you anti-semite)."
2105,e8geic3,"And it applies because you're acting like the whole world is different. As a woman living in the US the progress Muslim women are making looks a lot like the US in the 1800s. The reasons why theyre behind is because many of those countries haven't had technology as long, or still have very poor people living mostly without technology (like washing machines), and because of western involvement that imposed violent, opressive, woman-hating leadership.

Don't blame the women."
2106,e5ddja1,"It's probably useful to separate 'indoctrination' and 'force' from each other. The reason being that Islamists turn the indoctrination part on the West and say that Western girls are being indoctrinated to dress like sluts. And whether that's true or not or desirable or not doesn't matter because taking that bait means they successfully derail the discussion away from the topic. They don't need to convince Westerners, they only need to convince fence-sitting Muslims and give them something they can use to cope with their cognitive dissonance.  

Clearly Muslim women are not just indoctrinated. They also face very severe repercussions should they take that veil off. Either from their family, from their community or from the state. This is not true for Western women Even if we concede, for the sake of argument, that women are in fact indoctrinated to dress like sluts, there still are no consequences to women choosing to dress less slutty. So that's a massive difference. As long as there is such a massive consequence in play for women, there is no way that it can be conceived as voluntary.   

Now I don't believe Western women are indoctrinated to do anything (maybe to pursue expensive prospectless academic fields, but that aside), but not giving apologists their trap-card will really help the debate. Focus on the implications that mature women face when they don't dress the right way and the whole upbringing argument becomes moot.  

It's similar to people saying they don't like to criticise Islam out of respect for religion. But as long as there's violent repercussions for doing so, it becomes impossible to separate respect from genuine fear. And as long as those two are inseparable, the cowards have a means to save face while at the same time throwing the more individually inclined people under the bus.   "

 But the issue at hand is still the government telling what Muslim women can wear taking away their religious freedom and right to have personal responsibility.  I think it's safe to assume that Muslim women are little to no risk of any grand theft or extremely violent crime so other than discrimination I don't see a point to the law "
2109,dvm7o1u,"You have to understand Islam a bit to understand why this is such a big deal to her family. It's an inherently sexist religion like the other Abrahamics, so while Muslim men are allowed to marry outside the faith, Muslim women are not. This is because of the presumption that as the head of house, children will be raised in the religion of their father. Muslim father + Jewish mother = Muslim kids, and that's the goal. Jewish father + Muslim mother = probably not Muslim kids, and that's not acceptable. 

All of this means that *you* can't do anything. *She* has to make the decision to stand up to her family, tell them she's her own person not bound by the rules of a violent, sexist book of fairy tales from the 7th century, and live according to what she wants for herself. "
2110,dw5yb34,"I am Asian Australian and I think you got it backwards. It's Asian women who get targeted on public transport. Muslim women are targeted as well -doesn't matter what continent they're from. Because they are female, the chance of a violent response to harassment is much less. Possibly the elderly might get targeted. Etc. If you tried harassing a male of any race in Australia, I think you would have a really good chance that they go ballistic and stomp the hell out of you. Night time fights break out over the most trivial shit. A truly offensive slur would cause a riot.

I don't think you understand what Australia is like now. The population has exploded in the last ten years due to immigration from predominantly Asia. If you strolled around a capital city, you would be looking at Asian faces pretty often.  Statistically Australia is about 30% immigrants.

The average White Australian is friendly and sociable but it just takes one asshole on a train/bus to ruin it. Racism here is not that blatant against Asians. It's more about how we are treated by government, the workplace and in the media.

It's indigenous Australians who cop the worst racism. Check this recent one: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-22/myer-accused-of-racial-profiling-over-school-formal-row/9575314"

2113,dmlbniu,Don't forget that  Muslim women are just as violent and evil as or moreso than the men.  They are the ones who kill their babies by drowning after the grandfather rapes the infant.  Honour killing or some shit.

2116,dkodpcj,"There is a wide difference between internalizing inferiority and being an active participant in promoting your own inferiority and oppression. I'm Black, I myself have experience with internalized racism. But that is not the same as Black people as a whole oppressing themselves. Black people are not, for example, advocating for drug laws that discriminate against them, advocating for employers to not hire them, and advocating for media that portrays them as ugly and violent.

I am sure that there are many Muslim women who have internalized inferiority about themselves. However, I highly doubt that the vast majority of Muslim women are advocating for laws that restrict their own freedom.

The key difference between internalized inferiority and a population oppressing itself comes down to scale and result. "
2117,fqjpbgd,"Exactly. Women are amazing mashallah. Our communities would not exist without them. We can’t even measure how much our mothers, aunts, sisters, and daughters have sacrificed to keep the communities alive and now it’s a problem when women want to have standards. 

The problem is that women are “asking for too much” and this is “unfair” because the communities have grown used to women undervaluing themselves. The unreasonable are the minority but believe me when I say that everyone will face the consequences when women start standing up for what they deserve. It changes the dynamics of everything and people fight to keep change from happening. 

Muslim women are not only graduating colleges and universities at greater numbers than the men of the communities but they also taking care of their looks and their skills. Women are getting smarter and have learned how to live in a hostile world. Now they are thriving and it causes problems because while the girls were learning to get better a lot of the boys were smooth sailing and playing around. So no I don’t feel sad when a girl has standards I stand with her. 

If you want the standard, be the standard. So if an intelligent, educated, and beautiful woman wants an intelligent, educated, and attractive man; it is only fair."
2118,f8hfa62,"&gt;Sinister' okay.. 


What is that meat to mean?  Its not sinister for a minister to belittle and mock w marginalized group who may require his or his governments assistance?

&gt;No, the burka is oppressive


You don't get to decide what other people find oppressive.   Weird how women can dress in all sorts of costumes even covering their face and it's fine, but it's oppressive when freely chosen for religious reasons. 


If you are concerned about oppression of Muslim  women, don't you think you should be careful when talking about them, what they wear and their faith? Or does creating a hostile environment for them not count?


&gt;If you're this sensitive to people making fun if funny looking clothing there's not much middle ground we could reach. I can only ask you to consider that it's a piece of cloth.


A moment ago you were saying it's oppressive now it's just a piece of cloth. Boris wasn't saying it's just a piece of cloth, he was insulting those who wore it. Would insulting a kippah wearer,  be just a piece of cloth, would insulting a turban wearer?  Of course not.


&gt;Grown Muslim women are not 5 year olds on the playground. They're adults, they'll get past someone saying they look like a letter box. They dont need white knights like yourself butting in to be offended on their behalf.


So are grown black women, and grown disabled women, and grown lesbians, so it should be fine for a minister to mock them too over how they look right? Its up to everyone to stand up against this nonsense, calling it white knighting is idiotic. 


&gt;Having someone offend you isn't oppression, grow up. Silencing people who offend others would be oppression.


This isn't someone, a drunkard at the bus terminal, this is a major political figure in the government, even though he might sound like that drunkard.  

And   of course it can contribute to oppression ( you, after all, said a piece of cloth was oppression). Well do you think ministers in Muslim majority countries mocking women who unveil, are countributing to their liberating or their oppression?


&gt;Muslims have the right to offend anyone else.

This isn't about free expression but responsible expression. Now if a Muslim cabinet minister mocked Jewish men for their headwear, how long would they last. How many would be saying that's just fine.

&gt;I mock Christian dress all the time. I mock all religions, why is it that Islam gets the pass? Why is it that it's the only backwards religion fellow liberals seem to want to defend?


And Jews, and Sikhs, and Hindus. Do you mock women women in saris or with bindis, or how orthodox Jewish women wear wigs. Should cabinet ministers be doing that, ignoring the impact it has on their effectiveness as ministers?


Liberals tend to defend peoples free choice and defend minorities."
2119,e5ici8g,"&gt;Not to be overly cynical I don't think there's a shortage of people immigrating to Western secular nations while having little interest in adopting local norms (at least at first)

http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/political-and-social-views/

&gt; Fully two-thirds of U.S. Muslims identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party (66%). Far fewer say they are Republican or lean Republican (13%), while one-in-five say they prefer another party or are political independents and do not lean toward either major party. Muslim Americans’ partisan composition is little changed over the last decade, and they remain much more strongly Democratic than the public as a whole.
&gt; 
&gt; Muslims from a wide variety of social and demographic backgrounds express a preference for the Democratic Party over the GOP. Muslim adults of all ages, for example, heavily favor the Democratic Party. And attachment to the Democratic Party is strong among U.S.-born and foreign-born Muslims alike (67% and 66%, respectively).
&gt; 
&gt; Muslim women are somewhat more likely than Muslim men to affiliate with the Democratic Party (73% vs. 59%).
&gt; 
&gt; Just as they are much less Republican than the public as a whole, Muslims also are far less likely than other Americans to describe themselves as ideological conservatives. Just one-in-five Muslims (21%) describe their political views as “very conservative” or “conservative,” compared with 36% in the public overall who describe themselves this way. Muslims are not significantly more likely than all Americans to identify as liberal (30% vs. 28%); however, a greater share of Muslims describe themselves as politically moderate (39% vs. 32% of all U.S. adults).
&gt; 
&gt; 

And from one of the charts there, US Muslims in general are about as likely to believe homosexuality should be accepted by society as Baby Boomers and Protestants (around 52% of each), and college-educated Muslims are in line with the US in general (63%).

Now, this set is about US Muslims, not immigrants specifically, but it's reflective of the Islam that the left supports - secular, non-authoritarian, personal religion - Muslims that want to be _American_.

&gt;this is kinda my main point, if say someone with left-wing views is reluctant to see Christianity spread, why would they not also be reluctant to see Islam spread, considering how close in the spectrum these two are?

While I would generally prefer that everyone would become less religious, I think there's plenty of room for people to have their personal religion.  I don't care if Christianity or Islam _spreads_, in the sense of more people claiming to follow those religions, I just don't want those religions to be the justification for laws that restrict peoples' rights. I agree with Christians who think that helping the poor and needy is a good thing to do.  I don't agree with Christians who think gay sex should be illegal.  Neither of those opinions is because of the religion specifically.

There haven't been any attempts by Muslim politicians to add their doctrine to our constitution, that I'm aware of.  Public schools aren't trying to force children to recite the Koran or pray to Allah.  Yes, there are conservative Muslims who vote for politicians that try to pass conservative laws, but I don't think that forbidding Muslim immigration is a good response to that.

Basically, I see Christianity and Islam _in the US_ as about equally bad - while Islam is more conservative than Christianity in general, it's far less powerful, politically.  And while we're unlikely to ever end up in a theocracy here in the US, if we _did_ I think it's more likely to be a Christian one.  And as far as reforming Islam in other places - making it less strict, more secular, more compatible with US values - I don't think we're going to get there by making the US hostile to the ones that agree with me."
2120,dovoe7n,"I'm trying to stretch what you're saying to make sense of it in context of this sub and I'm struggling. 

I think you're trying to say the alt-right is hostile towards Muslims, occasionally specifically speaking out against how they believe Muslim women are treated : Some Muslim countries are safer for women (in terms of homicide rate) than the US : All men are men, including Muslim men :  the alt-right being hostile towards Muslim men and their perceived treatment of females is wrong :: this is a men's rights issue. 

It's a stretch. "
2121,doj83aq,"UAE is a less hostile/strict Saudi Arabia. Dubai doesn't produce oil or natural gas, so the Emir made his city to a tourist destination and a commercial center to buff it's income. If you want the dessert oasis experience, Dubai is the place to go. But it's still a conservative Muslim country, so tread lightly. I went there 2015.

You can still wear swimsuits, but only on the beach. Only Muslim women are required to cover their hair with a veil, but all women (regardless of religion) must not show their bare sleeves and legs (down to the ankles). Men's attire is pretty lax, so you can still wear shorts.

It's a great place to visit, with great food, and gold bar atms, but I declined a job offer there because of horror stories with the police cracking down on LGBTs."
