2,g1prkr0,"Ok, so:
1. The difference between bisexual and pansexual is that pansexual people are attracted to others regardless of what gender they are, while bisexual people are attracted to different genders

2. Care to specify what you mean by '""that whole thing with the pronouns""?

3. An asexual person is someone who doesn't feel sexual attraction. Asexuality is on a spectrum and you should really look deeper into that if you really want to understand it

4. Yeah, ""map"" is a pretty word for pedophile. I don't use that term because I prefer to call a spade a spade, not a gardening tool."
3,fw1p9i8,"Youre actually fucking disgusting and make the bi community look awful. Im ashamed to even fly the same flag as you, let alone identify as the same sexuality with the like of you. Youre being an asshole because of a stereotype that all pan people are transphobic and biphobic. Yes, the term ""pansexual"" has had a very questionable past but that doesn't mean that every pansexual person is a necrophile, pedophile or zoophile. NOT EVERY PAN PERSON INVALIDATES BI PEOPLE AND IS TRANSPHOBIC!!!

Also 2 genders...really? Fucking hell, dude. Gender has already been proven as spectrum multiple times by people with literal PhDs and Bill Nye who's an electrical engineer. You call other people transphobic, yet you invalidate non-binary and etc. because you cant literally do a 5 minute google to find out that non-binary people suffer from dysphoria or talk to an enby in a calm and collective manner. Go fuck yourself, cunt."
4,fy788w4,Pedophile? What the fuck does that even mean? Pansexual people are not pedophiles.
5,fpqnz2o,I have never heard any of that before. And whoever is claiming pansexual people are pedophiles is fucked up. Use whatever label makes you most comfortable!
6,e0mai79,"Is ""child"" a gender or sexuality? I'm sure one or two pansexuals in the world can be described as pedophiles, but... pansexual people are just attracted to men, women, and other genders."
7,dwvyozq,"‚ÄúJust in case you are curious‚Äù, I had greek mythology back in school so yeah, I know. 
Gay was used as a synonym to happiness. Will you say that you‚Äôre gay just because you‚Äôre happy? No, you won‚Äôt, because words change they meaning with time. The problem with pan - that gay doesn‚Äôt have - is that saying that we are attracted to anything, just like you did, helps perpetuate the false idea that pansexual people are zoophile/pedophile and stupid shit like that. 
We‚Äôre already invisible. People already look at us with eyes full of prejudice because they have this exact same assumption. The less you can do is not perpetuate it. "
8,evzj5br,"Bisexual people have a mental disorder that makes them attracted to both sexes, Pansexual people are delusional bisexual people who pretend there is more than 2 genders."
9,f0v7pk1,"How is it lazy to give people what they want? People love alternate adaptations of things. Its why the existing x-men have been reimagined as everything from 17th century samurai to highschool students in official Marvel media. AU is right up there with canon divergence as the most popular type of fan-created media. People like to look at stories they already like and go ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù.

Its also extremely realistic to have some facets of characters change over time, especially their depicted sexuality. Many popular characters have poorly fleshed out relations to other characters. There‚Äôs a lot of room for development. It takes real, sentient human people decades sometimes to figure out their sexuality. There are people talking about how that went for them right here in this thread. Lots of gay and asexual people come out to others (or even themselves) when they‚Äôre long since married with kids. Bisexual and pansexual people are still not straight even if they haven‚Äôt been with someone of the same sex during the run of a comic.

It isn‚Äôt at all unrealistic to have a character start dating someone of the same gender with no added drama, because it simply hadn't come up before in the story during the flashes of a character‚Äôs life you see in the game scenes or comic panels. Surprise, he liked multiple genders all along. It isn‚Äôt unrealistic to play it for drama. In real life it does tend to be dramatic, building a life while trying to suppress a part of yourself. It happens to people every day.

And even if its not realistic, even if it is ‚Äúforced‚Äù, who actually gives a fuck? They‚Äôre colors on a page. Everything they do is forced. You can change anything about them at any time for any reason. That‚Äôs how fiction works. There is nothing about a character that is inherently them, they‚Äôre an expression of an artists interests. An idea. Today they‚Äôre a team saving Gotham. Tomorrow one works in a coffee shop and the other‚Äôs a cat. Isn‚Äôt fiction amazing?

When people don‚Äôt seriously bat and eye over how a character like the Joker has been a sentient computer virus, Batman‚Äôs wife, a giant shadow creature that ate china, a vampire, a pirate, a cyborg, and whatever else he‚Äôs been imagined as over the last nearly 80 years, but they throw a fit over the very thought someone might interpret him as anything other than a cishet man, that‚Äôs not staunch loyalty to the character model. Its bigotry."
10,fd5as97,"i tell them to learn their damn bisexual history. bisexual people and trans people have, historically, been allies (though there are transphobic bi people and biphobic trans people, i'm just speaking generally). this is due to the fact that the mainstream LG movement mostly ignores and actively belittles us.

also, tell them to look up the bisexual manifesto 'anything that moves' from 1990. it explicitly mentions non binary people as well. the problem is not bisexuality. the problem is people taking the 'bi' part literally. but, even if you DO take it literally there are multiple ways to do that. for instance,

one could say they're attracted to similar and different genders from their own. one could say they're attracted to two or more genders. things like that that give it a broader definition. personally, i'm a big fan of the bisexual activist's robyn orchs definition of bisexual. it's the most open ended one i've found to date.

‚ÄúI call myself bisexual because I acknowledge that I have in myself the potential to be attracted ‚Äì romantically and/or sexually ‚Äì to people of more than one gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree.‚Äù

and none of this means that pansexual people aren't valid, either. pansexual people are in fact valid! pansexuality is simply defined as attraction \*regardless\* of gender, rather than gender being a factor in the first place. think of pansexual people, typically, as gender blind in a sense. a lot of bisexual organizations actually welcome pansexual people into their groups!

and the most important thing to remember is that we did not choose 'bisexual.' we reclaimed it from doctors and academics that studied us and tried to explain us for decades without really taking what we had to say into account.

in short, bisexuality is beautiful and has a rich, diverse history that is much more inclusive than a lot of people like to believe. there are many ways to be bisexual and they are all not exclusionary in any fashion."
11,e2vjefh,"Just like how a heterosexual person doesn't feel attracted to EVERY person of another gender, and homosexual people aren't attracted to EVERY person of the same gender. Pansexual people are definitely not attracted to EVERYONE. I for one have very defined tastes in people and very narrow standard for who I date. And I don't find a lot of people attractive. But when I do find people attractive or if I do decide to date someone, none of the reason that I decided to date/was attracted to that person would be because of their gender. That's what makes me pansexual, not that I don't have standards. I just dont feel attraction based on the contents of your pants, or how you identify on the gender spectrum. I feel attraction based mostly on who you are as a person, your personality, your attitudes, your philosophy, your fashion sense üòÖ, and emotional nature. Just because pansexuals dont discriminate based on gender doesnt mean that we can have standards and even high standards for who we are attracted to, and who we date. Just like every group of people the pansexual crowd most likely has it's hoes üòÖ but that doesn't mean we're all like that."

Nah. Intersex, pansexual people are included. You‚Äôre included for being bi, not because you put on a dress. If you‚Äôre not trans, you‚Äôre not trans. End of.

And I‚Äôm sure many other lgbt people agree your behavior is predatory and make it that much harder for actual trans people to not be seen that way. Don‚Äôt deceive people into having sex with you predator. "
14,fsmfzr8,"NTA. There‚Äôs always this fucking myth that bisexual/pansexual people are promiscuous just because we‚Äôre attracted to multiple genders.

15,ftbujwi,"I, as a pansexual girl, strongly dislike most of mainstream gay culture. I went to pride once and it was just way too much, especially for a public event. Admittedly, I am a more timid and modest person than most. I hate that whenever I make any sort of statement about being pansexual, people are surprised because I don't act that ""gay"" or they stereotype me to be hyper sexual/promiscuous if they don't know me well. I'd love to kill that stigma."
16,fcy4tu5,tbh i think it's mostly to head off the nutters who think that bisexual/pansexual people are just promiscuous people obsessed with sex (the whole 'greedy bisexual' stereotype)
17,eyeh3tj,"I have always known that I am attracted to people regardless of gender, coming out to other people was something I only felt like doing after realizing in late elementary and early middle school that not everyone felt the same way, and that I was actually different from the norm - so much so that people bullied me relentlessly after I was outed by a friend I thought I could trust, which I eventually just stopped denying. 

I‚Äôve always known this about myself, though it is such a minuscule part of my identity when I conceptualize who I am as a person. However I get frustrated by the erasure of my identity from heterosexual people as well as gays and especially lesbians (since I‚Äôm a woman) as well as the crude stereotypes that all bi/pansexual people are promiscuous, can‚Äôt be monogamous, and are always into the idea of threesomes. 

Because of the limited dating pool of the various towns I‚Äôve lived in, I‚Äôve only ever dated men and ‚Äúpassed‚Äù as ‚Äústraight‚Äù except to my partners whom I‚Äôve always been open about that part of myself with (otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be with them). I still after all this time have a lot of internalized biphobia and suppress any desires to fall in line with these stereotypes (fantasizing about a threesome or polyamory or being with women when I‚Äôm with my male partner), and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking about these feelings to anyone, my partner or my friends (the few I have, and all of them are LGBTQ+ in some way). 

I‚Äôm constantly feeling like I‚Äôm not ‚Äústraight‚Äù enough in a crowd of straight acquaintances or straight venues, and not ‚Äúgay‚Äù enough when I‚Äôm in queer spaces or hanging with my queer friends. It‚Äôs lonely, and I have sometimes wished I wasn‚Äôt pansexual so I could feel more like I belong somewhere without feeling like something is missing. 

Not sure if this is what you meant but thanks for allowing me the space to vent this when I think about it daily."
18,eqblwax,"Bisexual is being attracted to men and women, including non-binary people, trans people, etc. Basically, it means you care more about who the person is than what genitals they have.

The pansexual label is much the same, though it came about from folks who were looking to escape the stigma of being labeled 'bisexual.' There used to be a lot of nasty stereotypes around bisexuals, that they were too gay to be straight, and too straight to be gay, that they were disloyal and promiscuous, that they were 'dirty,' etc.

An easy way to avoid all that stigma was to simply call yourself something else. Since no one really knew what 'pansexual' meant at the time, it gave folks an easy opening to explain things for themselves.

However, this ran into a snag, because people would ask 'Well, isn't that just being bisexual?' So now people had to create a *difference* between the labels, and someone hit upon the idea that pansexual people are trans-inclusive, while bisexual people are not. This is, of course, a lie. Unfortunately, no one actually asked the bisexuals about this, and somehow this little bit of biphobia has caught on. If you'll notice, a couple of the other commenters here have repeated this lie, below.

In truth, there really isn't any significant difference between being bisexual or being pansexual. Use whichever label or flag feels comfortable to you."
19,e4li2g4,"I really wish we could just dispense with the labels. I'm attracted to humans whose attributes I find attractive! 

The right label for me is probably ""slut"" ;)

Edit to clarify (as this comment appears to have been marked controversial, and currently sits at zero karma):

I am not saying that bisexual or pansexual people are inherently promiscuous. I'm saying that *I* am kind of a slut. "
20,dzl1qof,"To my knowledge, ""pansexual"" most certainly does not include or endorse pedophilia.

What makes it distinct from bisexuality is that pansexuality covers attraction to people who don't necessarily fit a traditional gender binary particularly well.

It also doesn't mean someone is sex crazed and constantly aroused by every single person they see.

You see that misconception about bisexuality, too. Neither bisexual or pansexual people are necessarily any more promiscuous than hetero people or gay people.

Now, I'm not saying they needed to make Lando pansexual. That seems kind of extraneous. This isn't really a universe where we see a whole lot of overtime sexuality.

Some people have seen it as pandering, and I think that may be a valid take, though I'm all for media representation here and there of LBGT+ people."

22,fhgag7e,"pansexual is basically bisexual+, in that pansexual people are open to dating anyone regardless of gender. bisexuality doesn‚Äôt account for non-binary and genderfluid people. no idea what hypersexual is. as for keeping track of it all, i have no idea. it‚Äôs just kinda something you learn about over time i guess ?"
23,g99z2a6,"I'm probably gonna get hate for this butttt......

I don't believe there is a need for any sexuality label besides **Heterosexual** (opposite gender/sex), **Bisexual** (all/multiple genders/sexes), **Homosexual** (same gender/sex), and **Asexual** (no genders/sexes).

[Like this](https://i.redd.it/0qb4bumihdv41.jpg)

Any other sexuality is just micro-labels of those four, so we should just *stick* to those four and not overcomplicate things. You can say you're a certain sexuality, and if it's a little more complicated, then just explain it instead of making up a label for very specific things that no one is going to remember or take seriously.

And don't even get me started on those superrr specific sexualities like Fictosexual (only attracted to fictional characters), Iamvanosexual (likes receiving sexual touch but not giving), Pomosexual (not fitting into a box), Penultisexual (liking all genders besides you own), Bellussexual/Cupiosexual (interest in sex but no attraction), Apothisexual (sex-repulsed asexual), and so on...  It all just seems unnecessary.

And Yes, pansexual too, I know that one's veerryyyy popular. And I lowkey hate it. No one can ever give consistent definitions/clear differences between pan and bi. Most articles I read all say ""people have different definitions of pan and bi"". No one can agree on it, each person has their own definition. So Just say you're bi lol. Bi now includes all genders so you won't be exclusive towards anyone if you use it. And about the personality thing, lots of bisexuals like people for their personality, just like straight people and gay people. Pansexuality just sounds like someone trying to sound like a good person, or like they're morally better than bisexuals lol. Like bisexual people are all about sex and pansexual people are about personality."
24,g3f8juk,"Np:) Here we go. (it is most respectful to use LGBTQ+ to include everyone)

L = Lesbian, women who are only romantically/sexually attracted to women. 

G = Gay, men who are only romantically/ sexually attracted to men.

B = Bisexual, people who are attracted to two OR MORE genders (and yes, they ARE different from pan)

T = Transgender, people who do not identify with their natural-born sex, and transition to the opposite gender. 

Q = Queer, people who identify as not straight/cis but haven‚Äôt put a further label, or Questioning, questioning their sexuality/gender.

+ = People who use labels under the Non-binary umbrella (including Genderfluid, Agender, Genderqueer, etc), and usually use they/them pronouns. Asexual people do not feel sexual attraction. Aromantic people do not feel romantic attraction. Pansexual people are attracted to all genders. (there‚Äôs more, but I‚Äôll just leave it there)"
25,g4j1jx4,Non binary people are valid. Asexual people are valid. Pansexual people are valid. Everybody in the plus is valid. Just because you're too close minded to believe that these things people experience every day of their lives have even the slightest chance of being real doesn't mean you get to tell them they don't exist.
26,g5f6ear,"it could also be attraction to lack thereof. aka, asexual people (no drive to have sex) or aromantic people (no drive for romantic relationships) theres also attraction to people regardless of gender. for example; pansexual people are attracted to someone regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. 

but it definitely does not inclue attraction to children."
27,g10zkkf,"So basically Pansexual people are attracted to everyone (not kids, corpses, or animals tho obviously that's nasty) regardless of their genitals and gender identity, but they still have sex with said partner (unless said partner is asexual). Asexuals don't experience sexual attraction to anybody, but that's not to say they can't get horny from time to time. If somebody is PanAce, it means they're panromantic asexual, meaning they are attracted ROMANTICALLY to everyone, but sexually to nobody. My sister identifies as PanAce. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask or use Google. :3"
28,g80pjyl,"Sure! Let's break it down, it's a good example.

So all these four characters (straight, gay, bi, and pan) perceive her as a woman, based on things like her clothing, physical shape, and hairstyle. It doesn't matter if she's a cis or trans woman, or if she's actually not a woman but is dressing as one for whatever reason -- these characters are working with the information they've got, so for our purposes, she's a woman. 

I'm going to clarify what the straight and gay man say. The straight man says ""I find her face/body/whatever beautiful, because she's the sort of woman I'm sexually attracted to."" The gay man might say ""I find her beautiful, but I don't want to be in a romantic relationship with her and I don't want to sleep with her, because women just don't evoke that urge in me."" He might also say ""I don't find her beautiful,"" but I wanted to acknowledge that people can find someone aesthetically pleasing without being sexually or romantically attracted to them. An asexual, aromantic man (not interested in sex, not interested in romance) would say the same thing as the gay man, because he's not attracted to *anyone.*

There aren't clear definitions for ""bisexual"" and ""pansexual."" So I'm using the most workable distinction here, which is that ""bisexual"" means ""attracted to people of my gender and at least one other gender, and gender matters"" and that ""pansexual"" means ""attracted to people based on who they are as individuals, and gender doesn't matter much, if at all."" 

The bisexual person, like the straight man, is attracted to her based on personal taste -- they like tall women and she's tall, they like women who wear makeup and dresses and that's how she's dressed, they like confident women and she's striding purposefully down the street, they like her body, they like her face, she overall matches what they find attractive in women. They may or may not like the same traits in men or in nonbinary people, if they're attracted to nonbinary people.

The pansexual person is attracted to her because they like confident women and she's striding away down that street, because she reminds them of their ex-girlfriend and some of that attraction transfers over, because they like her face, and because the way she's dressed expresses her personality, which the pansexual finds attractive. They might also be attracted to her *as a woman* to some degree, but it's possible they're just attracted to her *as a person* who happens to be a woman.

But again, different people who identify as bi and pan may see it differently, and there's no one authoritative definition separating the terms. So yeah, it gets confusing."

34,fwiun8e,"Weighing in as someone who identified as bi and now as pan.

I have always went with bisexual meaning two. Attraction to two genders. It didn't have to be men and women. It could be any two genders, but bi literally means two. Bi was my first choice because in the small town I lived it it was the only one I had heard of. 

Pan however felt right because I am attracted to many genders. I am not attracted equally to all genders but I am definitely attracted to more than two genders. I am admittedly not picky about what genitals a person has so long as everything else clicks.

And last for OP. It is not phobic to not be attracted to a specific set of traits. You can actively want someone to be treated with equity and respect and still not want to have sex with them. A person who is not attracted to a penis will not be attracted to a penis no matter who it is attached to. Thats okay as long as they still treat the person with a penis as an equal and with respect/dignity. 

Heterosexual people are not automatically homophobic.
Homosexual people are not automatically heterophobic or biphobic.
Bisexual people are not automatically transphobic.
Pansexual people are not automatically all inclusive or biphobic.

Have consensual sex with adults that you are attracted to. Fight for everyone to have equal rights in both law and practice. 

Ill end with. I spend a lot of time explaining my own sexuality and I dont speak for all pansexuals. I also make a point of listing sexualities including bisexual, asexual, demisexual, etc. I don't want the label of bisexual to go away and I don't want bisexual people treated as confused or greedy. I used the bisexual label until I learned about pansexuality and am very well aware of how that is treated. My pansexuality isn't biphobic and isn't about erasing bisexuality. I just don't feel the bisexual properly encompassed all of the genders I am attracted to and that definitely is a worthwhile distinction for those of us who are not only part of the grsm community but also part of the kink community.

Bisexuality is valid. Pansexuality is valid. Transphobia is hateful and not limited to an orientation."
35,fx9d3du,"Another asexual here! My experience is similar to the above poster. I don‚Äôt watch porn because I have no interest in it and it all just seems vaguely gross to me. Imagine seeing a video of the private parts of someone you would never have any interest in - a huge hairy ugly biker dude, your grandma, etc - ewwww. Not interested. That‚Äôs how it feels to me. I will rarely (maybe once or twice a year) read erotica, though the build-up does more for me than any actual sex scenes, for the same reason.


I have never been physically attracted to any real person and have low or zero libido, so I have no real desire to masturbate. Though as the above poster mentioned, sometimes I‚Äôll do it for stress or to get to sleep. I didn‚Äôt even start until my mid-20s, and did so more out of a ‚ÄúI guess I should really make the effort to understand this part of my body more‚Äù obligation than any real drive to.


Again, of course, asexuality is a spectrum! There are also sub-types of asexual orientation under the banner. Some people identify as demisexual, where you don‚Äôt find a person attractive until you know them well. Others are autochorissexual, where they don‚Äôt want to ever personally be involved in or imagine themselves having sex, but they can get off to imagining characters or other people having sex. Some have a higher libido but no attraction - there‚Äôs the drive but nothing to spend it on. And there‚Äôs the whole range of how sex-averse people are. Some asexuals are happily partnered and, though they usually don‚Äôt initiate sex, are happy to do it because it makes their partners happy. Others never want to be touched at all. Some are in the middle and enjoy cuddling and kissing but not penetration. 


Part of what makes asexuality hard to understand at a glance is that there are so many different interpretations of it. The easiest way to explain it for me comes down to recognizing that ‚Äúno attraction‚Äù is just as important a part of recognizing someone‚Äôs sexuality as ‚Äúattraction‚Äù - otherwise, everyone would be bisexual. Straight men and lesbians are defined as being attracted to women, and are NOT attracted to men. Straight women and gay men are attracted to men and are NOT attracted to women. Bisexual/pansexual people are attracted to men AND women (and others). And asexual people are NOT attracted to men and NOT attracted to women. 


I‚Äôm also happy to help answer questions if you have any more!"
36,fyqied4,"No, there‚Äôs a big functional difference. bisexual people are attracted to people‚Äôs physique and their genitalia. Pansexual people are attracted to people for their personality, it has nothing to do with their genitalia. Pansexuality is often listed on the asexual spectrum."
37,fs1fok7,"NTA.

Pansexual is literally just bisexual, but transphobic. Ask anyone what the difference is and they'll cite some transphobic bullshit like ""Pansexual people are different from bisexual people because we can be attracted to transgender people too!"" As if being attracted to transgender individuals is somehow a special identity and not just... being attracted to someone who happens to be trans.

Your friend sounds incredibly annoying, and like she doesn't actually care about the LGBT community so much as she cares about ""gotcha""-ing other people who don't preform the same annoying political dances as she does.

&amp;#x200B;

Also- it's still just LGBT. the A+ is only added by cishet asexual people who wanna call themselves oppressed and use the q-slur.

 Asexuality is definitely real and asexual people need support... But barging into LGBT spaces, ignoring actual LGBT history, and demanding everyone else in the community reinvent the wheel for them is out of line and leads to dumb situations like this one."
38,furt6lz,"Stephen Hillenberg stated for a FACT that Spongebob is asexual (as he is a sea sponge and they are asexual)

Asexuality falls under the LGTBQ+ umbrella but no one ever talks about it because it‚Äôs not ‚Äúsexy‚Äù like being gay or bi or pansexual. 

People are only using this for publicity and to be trendy. Once pride month is over, Nick will probably retract any indication that Spongebob is gay."
39,fv0gjgc,"anthropologically there are 4 sexuality, Heterosexual, Homosexual, Bisexual and Asexual, I don't mind if people want to call it something else to be more specific, that's fine, but sexuality will always fall under one of these umbrellas (ie, all pansexual people are bisexual but not all bisexual people are pansexual)"
40,fv30mce,"I'm not an expert on pansexuality, but my understanding of the basic difference between asexuals and pansexuals is that pansexual people will feel sexual attraction for people that isn't bounded by gender, where we aces don't feel sexual attraction at all, or only feel it in very select circumstances. We're... kinda opposites in that sense. The point I was trying (and perhaps failing) to make is that whether and how we feel sexual attraction doesn't affect our actions or our ability to get horny. Pansexual people are pansexual because their sexual attraction doesn't distinguish by gender, and that's true even if they only ever get into sexual relationships with the opposite gender. Similarly, asexual people are asexual because they don't feel that sexual attraction much if at all, and that's true no matter how much sex we have or how horny we get.

As for how we come out as ace? I'm not sure I understand the question, to be honest, because the only way it's different from coming out as gay or whatever is the fact that asexuality isn't as well-known or understood, so we have to spend more time just explaining what asexuality **is**."

42,fr3egxm,"For point 1. ...

I mean the thing about ace/pan/demi/sapio : 

Asexual and pansexual people are actively discriminated against which is, partly, why they are (in my opinion at least) part of the LGBT+ community. 

On the contrary, nobody oppresses you because you like ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù. I would even argue that sapiosexuality is just a fancy word for a kind of contempt for class. This is a personal observation so it doesn‚Äôt mean much. But from my experience, when people say they are sapio, they simply mean that they like people with ‚Äúacademic‚Äù knowledge and the degrees that come with it. They won‚Äôt be into a mechanic even though it also requires quite a bit of knowledge to be able to work your way around an engine. But I could be wrong of course.

Anyway, I‚Äôm digressing.

For demi people, well ... I‚Äôm not sure they go through the same kind of violence and oppression (if any) (other ?) people from the LGBT+ community do. But as I said : I am not sure.

In my opinion, it is this shared experience of violence that makes the community. Of course, some of us are better off than others. Some may even be lucky enough to have never experienced discrimination. But there is an undeniable past of crimes committed against people like us. People are still getting killed everywhere in the world because they happen to be boys who like boys or a girl who was wrongly assigned male. Nobody has nor will ever beat someone up because they can‚Äôt sleep with someone who has never heard about Dvorak."

46,fflepiz,"My (grated incomplete and oversimplified) understanding of the community is there are three axis which describe different aspects of a person's sexual/gender identity, everyone is somewhere on each of these axis, LGBT people are not on societies default expectation.

The axis are:

1)Hetrosexual (attracted to a gender other than your own) -&gt; Homosexual (attracted to the same gender). Bisexuality occupy the middle ground with different bisexual experiencing different ratios of attraction of different genders. Pansexual people are like Bisexual but gender doesn't play a part (Bisexuals may be attracted to different genders differently or may have a preference towards one gender or another)

2) Cis (someone who was assigned the same gender at birth than they are) -&gt; Trans ( someone who was assigned a different gender at birth than they are). I think that Non-binary people are put somewhere on this spectrum and, from what i understand, don't identify as male or female. I am not extremely well read on this community, best look for someone better informed on these issues.

3)Asexual (someone who doesn't feel sexual attaction) -&gt; Sexual (someone who is sexual). Demisexual people are usually somewhere in the middle on this axis, they cannot experience sexual attraction unless they have a strong emotional connection first. (As in being close friends for several years kind of strong emotional connection).

&amp;#x200B;

There are subreddits for each of these communities if you what more information about a specific community. they are usually named after their group e.g. r/bisexual. the only exception i am aware of is r/actuallesbians which is the community for Lesbians, the r/lesbian subreddit is run by straight guys (I'm male, any actual lesbians out there please correct me if I am wrong on this one)."
47,fh3kmgh,"Homosexuality just means liking people (as in, dating-liking) that are the same gender as you. The opposite is Heterosexuality (homo - same; hetero - different; sexual - physical/sexual attraction). There are other things you could be as well: Bisexual or Pansexual people are attracted to more than one gender (bi - two; pan - all); Asexual people aren't attracted to anyone (a - not).

&amp;#x200B;

""Gay"" can refer to homosexuals, specifically male homosexuals (women are ""Lesbians""). However, ""gay"" has also been used as an insult, in the same way that ""retard"" was supposed to mean people more than 2 full grade levels behind in school (so a 6th grade student in your 4th grade classes); but is also used as an insult. I will note here that ""gay"" used to mean ""happy or cheerful""; as in the ""Deck the Hall"" lyric ""Don we now our gay apparel"" (we now dress in cheerful clothes); but the word is no longer used in that way.

Because you're in 4th grade (I am a substitute teacher, teaching 3rd through 8th grade as needed); you and your classmates get a pass on calling each other ""gay"" - for now. Depending on where you are; by the time you are in 6th grade, it might get the person using it in as much trouble as using the N-word, ""retard"", or other similar words - especially if you're near San Francisco or New York City (both of which have larger gay populations).

However, it is probably better to not think of it as an insult; and instead use it only to refer to homosexual men: men who prefer to date/marry other men."
48,fo4dn8q,"I look up what you said and the first thing that came up was ""A biromantic, pansexual person is¬†romantically attracted¬†to people of multiple¬†genders,¬†but¬†is¬†sexually attracted to all genders.

49,febtjwt,"This is almost right, but very wrong. Pansexual isn‚Äôt a fancy word for bisexual. Although the exact definition and distinction varies somewhat from pan person to pan person, pansexual people are sexually attracted to *anyone*. They‚Äôre attracted to cis-male, cis-female, trans-(wo)men, asexual, non-binary, gender fluid, and quite frankly anything else you can think of. Pansexual is a term coined to break from the limits of bisexual, an orientation which historically has teetered between binary genders (cis-gendered male and females), and for some, has not always been inclusive enough to satisfy how they would like characterize their sexual orientation. Now, that‚Äôs not to say that bisexual people *can‚Äôt be or aren‚Äôt* attracted to trans individuals. However, pansexual, by distinction, can be sexually attracted to these groups. Meanwhile, someone who identifies as bi might only be sexually attracted to cis-gendered individuals."
50,fb4type,"Here is what they are saying line for line (not my opinion but what they are stating) 

You can identify as a lesbian but still prefer male pronouns (maybe you aren‚Äôt ‚Äòout‚Äô yet to families, maybe you prefer going by old pronouns for other reasons). 

You can identify as neither male or female but still use the word ‚Äòlesbian‚Äô to identify your sexuality as you feel more in line with that then saying you are strait. 

You don‚Äôt need to have dysphoria (a medically defined strong uncomfort with your own body) in order to identify with a different gender then the one you were born with. 


I don‚Äôt have any idea with BD means. Body dysphoria, big deal, baby daddy, none of them work here. I know what Demi is, and the biggest problems that community has is that people don‚Äôt consider them a ‚Äòreal‚Äô sexual minority so it probably has to do with that. 

A sexuality is also not considered a real sexual minority by a large portion of the sexual minority community, that is probably the sentiment this person is responding to. 

This next seems like a typo (actually should be asexuality) just pretty much repeating  the thing from the previous line. 

Neopronouns (zer, zim) any pronoun that is not male female or plural neutral like ‚Äòthey‚Äô are things that you should adopt if somebody prefers to be referred to in that way. 

Pansexuals and bisexuals are not the same thing as there are more than two genders. Bisexual people are attracted to at least 2 genders but not all, pansexual people are attracted to all.

You are an aphobic truescum:

You have beliefs that are harmful to asexual people. 
True-scum is somebody that believes that the only real kind of trans person is one with disphoria. 


My opinion time: 

I honestly don‚Äôt know how people still don‚Äôt know the language of most of this stuff. I am a strait cis person who isn‚Äôt even an active  part of sexual minority organizations and have learned this language  through osmosis pretty much. Some of this stuff is kind of important and it might be in your interest to pay attention instead of just disregard something because it is new to you."
51,fba973v,"By not being heterosexual, asexual are inherently not het. By not being heteroromantic, aro people are inherently not hetero. 

Our understanding and the social privileges that come with being heterosexual are based around being sexually and romantically attracted to another gender. If you are not both of those things, you don't have it.

I won't speak on cis, because a lot of people are. A lot of gay and bisexual and pansexual people are also. Doesn't make them not part of it."
52,fbaml1p,"Demisexual is a label associated with the asexual spectrum, meaning that someone only develops attraction in limited circumstances where they're already close to someone. It doesn't say anything about what genders someone is capable of feeling attraction toward. They might be straight, gay, bi, pan, etc.

Pansexual people are attracted to people of all genders, or experience attraction regardless of gender."
53,f1zb4kz,"Well, Genders, is your gender, or sex, its who you are, and what you identify as. In modern times gender can be seperated into two categories, the biological genders, male and female -as we seen in the animal kingdom, and then we have the sociological genders, this is where genders get alot more complicated, since we don't just care about what your body is, but allso starts to care about what the persons feel as, their role, their norms and so much more. This is the reason in the modern world, we no longer just have to genders, but nonbinary, intetsexs and more genders are starting to be a part of our daily lives.   


Transgendered people, are a part of this aswell, people who feel distant to their biological gender (In most cases), and because of that see away from it, since their sociological gender is far different then their biological, and they wish to correct this ""error (lack of better work)"".   


Now sexualities, have nothing to do with ones body, or gender. A sexuality isnt something to do with the person in question at all, instead sexuality, is who, and what a person is into, attracted to, turned on by, and much more. A heterosexual person, is attracted to their oppesit biological gender, while a bi sexual, is attarcted to both biological genders. Sexuality is a highly complex thing, but at its cores it can be seperated into:  
Heterosexual(oppesit biological gender), homosexual(same biological gender), bisexual(both biological genders), and asexual(And none of the sexual genders).  
But, thats sexuality in a simple form, if we look at sexuality more advanced, it gets alot more complicated since we start to have sexualiaties such a demi-sexual, panssexual, and many more. 

Now these more ""complicated"" sexualities don't just care about the biological gender, if we take panssexual, its the attraction to personalities, so this at its core, is a sub category to bisexual, in that the biological gender dose not matter, but instead its the persons personality the person in question is turned on by, or maybe some personality traits, like ""a strong sense of empathy"" could be something pansexual people are turned on by,. Meanwhile demi-sexual people, are turned on by romantic thoughts, and feelings for others. meaning they aren't turned on by the body, or personality, but instead the feelings between two people."
54,esrr9yo,"Pansexuality= Romantic and sexual attraction to people of all genders (making an active statement to include non-binary people), OR rom/sex attraction to people irregardless of gender. A lot of pansexual people say they more attracted to personalities than body parts. Pansexuality is a subgroup of bi+ identities since all pansexual people are by definition bisexual. Bisexual people can also be attracted to non-binary people, it's just not actively stated in the label. Which label you prefer is up to you, a lot of younger people prefer pan whereas a lot of adult/older people prefer bi because of the history and public knowledge of the word. 

Demisexuality= A person that is on the asexual spectrum, but has the ability to develop sexual attraction towards people they share an emotional bond with, for example a friend they've know for months/years and they go on a trip with them for a week and bond closely on an emtional level, then sexual attraction can form. The emotional bond can also be romantic, but doesn't have to be. Demi's can't develop Primary sexual attraction, but can Secondary sexual attraction. When there is no bond with a specific person, the demisexual person feels no sexual attraction to anyone.

Hope this clears it up!"
55,etju200,"No, it's a mixed construction crew of gay men and straight women who build women's washrooms, and straight men and gay women who build men's washrooms. Bisexual and pansexual people are banned. Asexual people supervise the overall build."
56,etlxw1r,"‚ö§Bisexuality is strictly male or female, and means you are attracted to both male and female. You are both gay and straight. You are bi. You find women attractive, and you find men attractive. 

üåàüç≥Pansexuals can be bisexual, but not all pansexuals are bisexual. 

Pansexual means all of sexuality. You can be attracted to anyone, regardless of their gender. You are attracted to the person; regardless of their gender. A pansexual person might not be attracted to males or females specifically. A pansexual is attracted to people on an individual level, regardless of the gender the person is. A pansexual will just be attracted to the person themselves, their soul; and their gender does not matter.

üåàü¶Ñüí¨Pansexuals are unique since they are attracted to the person themselves, regardless of that person's gender. The secret is that pansexuals are really soul sexuals, they find specific souls attractive, regardless of the gender of the host/body/avatar.

üåàStraight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and asexual people have the ability to be gender conditional/specific and say I am only attracted to this gender, but not that gender. Pansexuals are not conditional, they are unconditional; so they cannot be gender conditional/specific and say I am only attracted to this gender, but not that gender; they can be attracted to anyone at any time. Pansexuals are not one color/spectrum of the rainbow, Pansexuals are the whole rainbow! üåà 

Here's where it gets interesting... üé≥ Some pansexuals may be mostly straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or asexual, butt a pansexual cannot fit into any of those specific categories, because pansexual people are not specific to whom they are attracted to. Pansexuals will always just be unconditionally attracted to random people regardless of their gender. In reality, pans don't look at the person's body, they look at the soul.

So... 

Bisexuals can be pansexual, but not all bisexuals are pansexual."
57,f1niloq,"And yet you completely ignore- for the second time, the point of Asexual people who still feel romantic attraction to people of the same gender. By that logic someone can be happily married to someone of the same gender, but because they don't have sex they're not actually a part of the community; it's the same as arguing that a bisexual/pansexual person is somehow less bisexual if their partner is a different gender than them. I honestly don't understand how you can stand there and claim the moral high ground when you're here arguing that someone doesn't deserve the option of seeing themselves represented in the books they read just because those books don't reflect your ideal. 

Not every LGBT focused book (especially those marketed towards a YA audience like many of the suggestions in this thread) needs sex scenes, anymore than every heterosexual romance needs them. I'll agree that sex in some books is an important element but there's many books where the sex scene can be lifted out entirely, or replaced with a simple ""fade to black"", without detriment to the story itself, and the OP has mentioned that they're interested in these books as well."
58,epuf259,"There is wayyy more that goes into developing a society and a culture than just gender and sex. The patriarchy runs off of sex based oppression, so yes- each world would have a partiarchial like system. That isn't to say that females couldnt change the game, perhaps on world A it would be a matriarchial system, but really it depends on so many other things. The patriarchy was not built on oppressing feminine people, but since femininity, women, and female became tied together the patriarchy now oppresses each of those things in it's own way. To that end, the importance of gender in each world would determine other gender indicators. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just as a note, attraction to personality is panromanticism, and probably what you were trying to get at. The average person on world S (our world) is attracted to the pheromones and physique of the people they are sexually attracted to, or as you put it, genital attraction. People often have the same romantic and sexual attraction, however not everyone. Think of asexual people, they often still desire a life partner for cuddles and maybe making out, but they are still asexual, they just have a different romantic attraction. Personally I think this is important, since pre op trans people often have traits that don't conform attracting heteroromantic and heterosexual people (or homo/homo) but attract people who are bi or pan in some way. (i also don't see pansexuality as a thing- pan romanticism is 100% real and valid, but personally I think humans are sexually dimorphic and so pansexual people are expressing a panromantic bisexual identity, but thats not a hill I'd die on)"
59,eqt6wzd,"a few things, take it or leave it:

-some intersex people are embracing their traits as an identity rather than a defect, whether they see themselves as female, male, or nonbinary. it is akin (to some) to being transgender, where the physical aspects of their sex do not align with their gender identity, but it‚Äôs viewed as part of their journey and not a ‚Äúmistake.‚Äù

-individuals who identify as asexual and aromantic (or anything comparable) often feel drawn to the LGBT+ community because they see it as a space for all people of minority sexualities. many people are divided on whether or not this is a fair inclusion. personally, as a queer person, I don‚Äôt see an issue with it, but that‚Äôs just my opinion.

-personally, I think it‚Äôs more than a bit uncouth to say that anything that isn‚Äôt lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender is automatically wrong, made-up, or unfit for the LGBT+ community. times change, and we grow to accept identities and people we once pushed aside as nonsense. does that mean everyone with a shiny, new label and a flag they designed in MS paint deserves recognition? no, but to say that ‚Äúasexual‚Äù or ‚Äúpansexual‚Äù people are unequivocally unfit for the community in the same way that ‚Äúflower-sunshine-gender‚Äù people are is, to me, painting anyone who isn‚Äôt *you* with a very broad brush."
60,ekcz64j,"Bisexual/pansexual people are attracted to other genders. Sometimes their same-sex attraction influences their other attractions, but not always.

And I know you didn't list them in the acronym, perhaps because you feel it is irrelevant since it doesn't concern them, but there are also asexual people who aren't attracted to the same sex.

Now, as for straight guys who don't ascribe to the whole ‚Äúa woman to protect‚Äù thing, they're out there. I know I'm not typical, as a trans femme non-binary person, but despite being raised as a guy and being attracted to women, I never liked the ‚Äúrescue the princess‚Äù model. I had a long relationship with a girl who wanted the whole ‚Äúmake me feel like a princess‚Äù thing, and I discovered that I hated it. I didn't want a princess; I wanted a functional human being who tries to solve her own problems before whining to her boyfriend.

Although I now identify as an atypical gender, I did go through the whole song and dance that is exposure to society's toxic masculinity. I doubt I had some special resistance to it just because I'm enby, and by that what I'm getting at is that I think there are cis guys out there who don't buy into the whole unbalanced gender dynamic, either. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I'm sure it feels like you're ‚Äúolder,‚Äù but I'm in my late 30s and only got married for the first time (and the only time, if I have anything to say about it) a few years ago. And what's more, I know a woman in her 70s who just started dating again. Between those two examples, it *definitely* isn't too late for you. ‚ô•Ô∏è

Remember: it isn't a question of how many people out there are a good match for you. The question is how many would like a person such as you, versus how common people like you ARE.

In other words, even if you're really hard to find, if there are enough people looking for you (and no substitutions), you can find one of them. :)"
61,eqj4obx,"The ones I believe I understand well enough to lay out are:

Asexual: person does not experience sexual attraction (this is a spectrum)
Queer: person is not solely or at all attracted to the opposite gender
Demisexual: person requires a romantic attraction before experiencing sexual attraction

Obviously this list is far from comprehensive, and I left out things like greysexual and quite a few others, but I don‚Äôt have a good enough grasp on them to explain those to others.

The shit actually happens a decent amount that he‚Äôs talking about. If you want real life cases from someone who is 

1. Above 18 because people were getting fucking enraged that he was 17, because that 1 year makes SUCH a difference.
2. Lives in a very diverse area (Vegas)
3. Has LGBTQ+ people in my family and knows a wide variety of LGBTQ+ people, Well here you go:

I know personally 3 Trans people that I would call friends and about 2 more I am acquaintances with. Those 2 I am not close with I am not close with because they share the opinion that if they asked me out and I said no because they are trans, I am transphobic. Which makes them dumbasses. 1 out of the other 3 shares this but he isn‚Äôt so ‚Äú!!!‚Äù About it so he‚Äôs chill.
Excluding Trans people even tho they are LGBTQ+ because we‚Äôve already brought them up, I know about 4 gay people, 3 Bi people, 2 Lesbians, 1 asexual person, 1 pansexual person, and that‚Äôs all I can‚Äôt think of off the top of my head. 

2 out of the 4 gays people I know have hit on me, a male. 1 took my rejection very well and we are friends to this day, the other thought it would be a good idea to grab my dick and tried to pull the gay card when I punched him in the face. The other 2 are just my friends and good dudes all around. 

All the Bi people I have ever met are wonderful people and we‚Äôre friends to this day 

1 of the Lesbians is my gf‚Äôs best friend and an amazing person, the other was screaming and crying oppression when I threw her out of my home when she grabbed my gf inappropriately 

The asexual person is one of my ex‚Äôs and an amazing girl, totally understood when I broke up with her after she came out because sex is important to me in a relationship, friends to this day

The pansexual person is chill but we don‚Äôt really hang out that much

Where I live the LGBTQ+ community is prevalent, and as with any group I would say about half are very nice and some of the most amazing people you could meet. 25% don‚Äôt share my opinions but are open enough to accept that and move on, and even engage in a healthy dialogue, also making them amazing people. But in my experience, at least 25% of the entire LGBTQ+ community are toxic, and think themselves above everything because of their sexual preference. They do what they want and when they get denied they pull their minority/ sexuality card (whatever you want to call it.) There is a major problem in the LGBTQ+ community with people like this that needs to be addressed, because even when it‚Äôs not over half of your people like this, if it‚Äôs a good chunk of the community, those loud extremists are going to be the most prevalent faces of your community. Which is what is currently happening in my opinion."
65,ed9cgzt,"What‚Äôs not binary? I have no idea what you‚Äôre referring to there. But I know plenty of straight, gay, and bi people who are attracted to androgynous traits, so that doesn‚Äôt really have anything to do with orientation and is simply a matter of personal preference. Same goes for if a person is asexual. Sure, being asexual might limit a person‚Äôs dating options, since most people generally expect there to be a sexual relationship, but that doesn‚Äôt mean straight, gay, or bi people aren‚Äôt going to be attracted to them or want to date them. If you‚Äôre trying to say that a pansexual person is more likely to date an asexual person, I would argue that the people most likely to happily date asexuals are other asexuals. Between bi and pan, the chances would be equal. "
66,eeetfrw,"In the hypothetical the gay man is discriminated against because his spouse is a man. However, in this same hypothetical a straight man wouldn't be discriminated against because their spouse was a woman.

In this case the discrimination is due to the sex of the individual and the sex of their spouse. This is not whataboutism - this is highlighting the fact that the sex of the spouse is what matters; not the sexual orientation.

Some people identify as straight but still have sex with men. If they wanted to move into this building with their sexual partner - they would be discriminated against even though they identify as straight. That is straightforward discrimination based on sex or expectations of sex.

I am not saying that there is a ""correct"" sexuality for any given sex. Instead I am saying that the sex of your partner is inherently tied to sexuality. A bi or pansexual person is attracted to both (or all) sexes. An asexual person is attracted to no sexes. There is an intrinsic link between your sexual orientation and the sex of your partner.

It sucks, but discrimination based on the sex of your partner is discrimination based on sex; not sexual orientation."
67,e6qc6ej,"Unfortunately I wrote this entire comment once, my draft disappeared and I had to rewrite it, so there are a number of points missing. Furthermore, you are banned from this subreddit now, so you do not have a chance to respond, which makes my reply somewhat unfair. But I couldn't leave a number of points left unmade. 

&gt;I don't know how you conclude that ""no autogynephilic trans women reported asexuality"", can you expand?

If you include ""a little bit"", then around 2/3 of cis women experience that. Also my comment about absurdity was not about the prevalence of AGP among asexual trans women, but about the mechanism by which AGP is proposed to exist. 

Furthermore, if we look at page 79, then we can see that the average Core Autogynephilia score for asexual participants was *lower* than that of androphilic respondents. If we're going to include asexual people in the ""AGP"" category, then by Veale's results we'd have to include androphilic (HSTSs) people, which then puts literally everyone in the AGP category. 

My comment about the absurdity was far more related to Blanchard's comments on asexual trans women; 

&gt;In some others, the intensity of the autogynephilia‚Äìwhich is attraction to an imagined ‚Äúinner woman‚Äù‚Äìis so great that there are no erotic feelings left for other people. This accounts for asexual identification. (Asexual autogynephilic males have plenty of sexual fantasies, but these fantasies tend not to involve other people.)

and

&gt;Analloerotic [meaning asexual] gender dysphorics represent those cases in which the autogynephilic disorder nullifies or overshadows any erotic attraction to women; those cases, in Hirschfeld's metaphor, in which ""the woman within"" completely supplants her fleshly rivals.

That's the part that sounds like he's trying to make shit up in order to justify his typology. 

&gt;I didn't define pansexuality in a way that excluded attraction to dimorphism, I defined it in a way that allowed attraction to androgyny. Regardless, ""pansexual"" is a questionable category in that it's not very crisply defined.

Your underlying assumption is that pansexual people are more attracted to androgyny and that on some level, and that straight/bi/gay people are not. I agree that ""pansexual"" is not clearly defined, but that's not bad or contested. It's common among other sexuality definitions; homo/heterosexuality (homo/heteroflexible), bisexual (homo/heteroflexible)

&gt;I totally question the reports of HSTSs, but only when relevant. Blanchard tested whether HSTSs might be denying their AGP and found no effect. In addition, HSTS's narratives don't contradict their objective past in the same way that AGPTS's narratives often do. A good place to look for HSTS lies would be in their porn preferences, IMO. HSTSs claim to only like straight porn, despite clearly having more physiological arousal to gay male porn.

The problem is that Blanchard does not. Also, Blanchard's claims has not panned out contemporarily given a wealth of data indicating around equal prevalence of MtF and FtM trans individuals. Furthermore, as shown previously, Veale is unable to replicate the effect of social desirability bias on results. 

&gt;What does ""not indicative"" mean?

It means that differential presentations of a condition does not mean that the condition is not present in both populations. Just because lesbian women are supposedly less likely to have AGP (barely statistically significant) does not mean that AGP does not exist in cis women. Autism presents differentially in women and men, autistic women still exist

&gt;I'd go with some Bayesian definition based on probability updates, which means we would have to look at predictions. 

.

&gt;Kay Brown predicted that Moser's items would have no validaty, 

Brown should read [Moser's explanation of his criterion](http://sci-hub.tw/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2010.485859?journalCode=wjhm20)

Let me break down Brown's article;

&gt;We can find hundreds of such examples, very often showing that this behavior is most noted in early adolescence, but continues into adulthood. In fact, we have an entire genre of erotic fiction and images (still and motion picture porn) dedicated to the tastes of autogynephilic adult male individuals.  These examples and the males that experience it are common enough that they also form organizations to join together to support each other emotionally and even politically.  So, no, we can‚Äôt say that autogynephilia does not exist.  The null hypothesis is easily proven wrong.  Autogynephilia in some males exists.

Just from this passage, we can easily argue that autogynephilic cis women exist. The standards for proving AGP existence in a population for Brown are clearly very low. 

&gt; He carefully rewrote questions from an instrument intended for and validated only for males in a gender clinic setting?

Yes if you define a condition as being exclusive to males, any attempt to extend the condition to non-males is going to lead in contradict. It's a tautological assertion to say ""AGP only exists in males"" because it's (apparently) defined this way

&gt;Well, looking carefully at the rewrite, they don‚Äôt seem to have even a passing bearing on what autogynephilia would theoretically look like in women, or even in androphilic transsexuals

Read his paper. 

&gt;One and only one demonstrably invalid study.  We still have no evidence to disprove the null hypothesis.  So, for now, we must accept that females do NOT experience autogynephilia.

She didn't prove it wrong and she's ignoring Veale 

&gt;These studies all clearly indicate a strong correlation with non-exclusively androphilic reporting a high, nearly universal, percentage of individuals acknowleging autogynephilic arousal, either currently, or in early adolescence, and a strong anti-correlation with exclusive androphilia

Nearly universal is way overstating it. 

&gt;To support the null hypothesis, there should have been no correlation with sexual orientation.  The null hypothesis is NOT supported, there is NOT one group, but two.

That's not how group analysis works. To argue that a coherent, distinct grouping exists, you have to perform a number of statistical tests to establish its existence and then verify its usage. It isn't just ""well a correlation exists, so there are groups!"". Relevant research is Daphna Joel and of course Veale. 

&gt;Further, the null hypothesis regarding autogynephilia not being correlated with gynephilic/bisexual/asexual transwomen, and only these transwomen, is not supported.  

&gt;Androphilic transwomen and natal female women do not experience autogynephilia.

I don't understand how she comes to the conclusion that androphilic trans women do not experience AGP when there is ample evidence they do (even if it is at a lower rate than gynephilic trans women). Sounds like she's being either scientifically illiterate (likely) or intentionally disingenuous (less likely but plausible)

&gt;but causation does require correlation

Definitely scientifically illiterate. https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/26300/does-causation-imply-correlation &amp; https://www.christopherspenn.com/2018/08/can-causation-exist-without-correlation/

Forgot the article wasn't done wew. 

Her analysis of the 9 points ignore all contradicting research, but that's fine. 

&gt;Plausability.  This is almost self-evident.  If one‚Äôs sexual ideation is exclusively autogynephilic, if each time such an individual sees herself as obligatorially female during sex, that would be strong drive towards gender dysphoria and an incentive to adopt a female gender identity, over time.

Unsubstantiated assertion. 

&gt;while Julia Serano wrote ""numerous cis femme-identified queer women have told me (in informal conversations) that they regularly experience FEFs"", seemingly predicting that AGP would be more common in lesbians than straight women. If we find the opposite of her prediction, then that means that there is some issue with her model.

She's not making a prediction, she's talking about anecdotes. She isn't saying ""more queer women than straight women"", she's saying ""some queer women have FEFs"". 

&gt;No, as I said I've done surveys about autogynephilia in cis women.

Nobody cares about your surveys.

&gt;Veale's results supports my point, since she showed that her AGP scale gave higher results for straight than lesbian women.

 Dubious. From page 66, the relationship was not statistically significant (which does not suggest there is no correlation, just that we have not rejected the null hypothesis). Interestingly enough, the r coefficient for AGP vs gynephilia was .18. Doesn't sound very strong now, does it Brown

&gt;I have asked AGP trans women about this. Worth qualifying this a bit: I think you'd probably get different results depending on whether you mention the AGP theory or not, as mentioning the AGP theory would allow social desirability bias to more come into play. I'm planning on demonstrating this soon.

See above on your surveys. Also it's pretty funny that you're using this as criterion for AGP since it's so vague, non-specific and irrelevant (ironic given the critique of Moser). I would be considered an autogynephile and an autoandrophile by this criterion, and I'm sure a lot of people would. 

Interesting that *you* found that lesbian cis women have higher rates of your (awful) determiner of AGP, so there's that against your argument in this thread. 

Social desirability bias is an easy way to invalidate any study that disagrees with one opinions. 
"
68,e6so1vu,"We gays are the majority of queer people, so we use it most often, and usually referring to gay people, instead of qualifying people as lesbian or gay. In that way it‚Äôs more of a term for gender acknowledgment/equality. 

But queer includes anyone who is on the LGBT spectrum. Most ‚Äúasexual‚Äô (personal experiences) people don‚Äôt want to be  ID‚Äôed as queer, because they don‚Äôt have a sexuality. They‚Äôre just people. 

The key point that *could* be made here is that bisexual people (or pansexual people) are sexually compatible with more people than anyone else. If someone is interested in their sex they‚Äôre bisexual. If they‚Äôre interested in gender, or lack thereof, they‚Äôre pansexual. Pansexual really means that you‚Äôll fuck anyone who wants to fuck you. Must be fun af. "
69,e06uubb,"Your definition of non-binary is incorrect. Non-binary includes anyone who is not a single binary gender 100% of the time. It's an umbrella term that includes many different types of genders. 

Some people, like myself, have a stable gender (doesn't change) that is neither male nor female. I consider myself gender neutral, which is to say that I have a strong sense of gender, but it is not related to woman or man.

Other non-binary people are agender, and don't have any gender. They see themselves as just people, and gender is something other people have. (Think the gender equivalent to asexual.)

And there are also people who are polygender, meaning they have more than one gender, either at the same time or due to gender fluidity. 

For example, a bigender person who is both male and female at the same time, always. Or a person who is gender fluid, sometimes feeling female and other times feeling gender neutral. There is also gender pivot, where someone has one stable gender that is always there, and one or more fluid genders that come and go. 

Non-binary people are extremely diverse in how we experience and express our genders, it's not just one thing. Just like how not all bisexual or pansexual people are split 50/50 on how much they are attracted to men or women. Many of them like non-binary people too, or they like one gender more sometimes and another gender more at other times. "
70,e047qay,"same sex \- **homosexual**

opposite sex \- **heterosexual**

both sexes \- **bisexual**

anyone \(includes trans people and hermaphrodites\) \- **pansexual**

no one \- **asexual**

""Anyone"" is where your argument breaks down. Because initially the discussion was sexuality, and you state that homosexual is between the same sex, hetero is between two different, and bisexual is with both. But then for *pansexual* you don't actually cover different sexes, you cover genders and mutations, which are not sexes.

You've set the bound for what is a sexuality by making it about attraction between natural sexes, and then you've included a new, special category outside those bounds. Hermaphrodites and artificial genders are not new sexes, they're abnormalities which you claim 'pansexual' people are accepting of. Because they accept anything. Bisexual already accept either sex, the only thing 'pansexual' people do is claim to be more accepting. Of non\-sexes. Which means they shouldn't be included in a list of sexuality. More like they're less picky bisexual people.

The only difference, as far as sexes are concerned, between pansexual and bisexual, is the spelling and the personal preferences of those who identify as it. Which makes it, fundamentally, a useless category for sexes.

But you don't raise a point that op forgot asexual people. But that's another debate entirely. "
71,dw8pap0,"When did I say that non binary trans people can't be part of bisexual communities? I didn't say they can't be bi, I'm just saying that pan is a more accurate description of someone who likes more than one gender. You may be mistaken as to my point because earlier you were talking about how bisexual used to describe people with mixed characteristics. That is irrelevant to the way I'm using the word to describe sexual orientations. 

While you're right that there's nothing grammatically incorrect about it and also people have the right to self id but...

If ur so knowledgeable about linguistics then you know how important it is to be precise. Look at all of the words we are discussing, heterosexual homosexual asexual, Demi sexual, poly sexual. Look at how amazingly descriptive they allow us to be, drawing detailed distinctions between each that would be lost entirely if we only used, unisexual, asexual, and bisexual. dYou are correct that common usage of words is the meaning of words, and there is nothing wrong with using them that way, even in a formal setting, but if you want to be, precise and specific, pansexual would more accurately describes someone capable of experiencing attraction to anyone regardless of body config or expression and identity. And bisexual would more, accurately describe someone only attracted to two genders. This is fact if there is ANY difference in the words because these are the ONLY differences. 

Hey? If the distinction between bisexual and pansexual doesn't matter because we could just use one word to say ""anyone that likes more than one"", then let's just call all Herero and homo people unisexual. Both usages let us use one word and it's technically correct for both.

As someone into linguistics, I'm shocked that you want to dismantle our language by impeding its ability to be fully descriptive of Everyone's sexuality. After all details are what make language colorful. There's a reason all these different prefixes exist for the word sexual. To describe DIFFERENT things. Also what about all of the bi people who don't like trans people? You are trying to say that pan is just a part of bi, but saying that trisexual is the same as bisexual, is the same as saying , bisexual is the same as unisexual. Or quadrasexual is the same thing as trisexual.

On common everyday usage, well, people can misuse words entirely or could be subjective meanings (like here which is why people can self identify, so with words being used so many ways in the same day by different people, how do we document and reference the common agreed upon definition? The dictionary. According to dictionary.com and Merriam Webster. Bisexual is someone attracted to both men and women, or to people of various gender identities. And pansexual is someone who is unlimited in they're attraction to other people by gender etc blah blah blah. Couple things 1. Despite that these definitions to allow bisexual to describe people attracted to various gender identities, this does not negate the fact that they also show my point, that you can use them more precisely. 2 the definitions are still very different things (multiple various != all/unlimited.

Your arguement that pansexual people are just a ""part of bisexual"" hinges on the idea, that because pan people like what bi people like, we can ignore that they like something in addition to this.

This is the EXACT same as a straight person trying to say, oh well because you like the same gender u r homosexual, I'm going to ignore that you like something in ADDITION to that makes you DIFFERENT.

Explain how those two situations are different? Also btw that's something my dad said when I came out as bi and I told him no I'm not gay dumbass I like women, and he said it's the same thing. U r song the same thing. U are ignoring what I like in addition to others and ur ""oh it's the same thing"". 

What you are doing to pan is what people do to Portuguese, it's not spanishs little brother, it's it's OWN language, that developed in a different location (within the same greater area) and was spread across the world by a distinct colonial power, to a separate population"

75,dlo5ab0,"&gt;That's the thing - asexuality IS a spectrum. Sexuality is fluid - even bisexuality is sort of a spectrum in itself in that some bi people are more attracted to men, or more attracted to women, or more attracted to genders in between/outside of that binary. Bisexuality isn't ""I like men 50% of the time and women 50% of the time."" Labels aren't rigid. 

The labels ARE rigid. There is potential a spectrum within them, but the label does not change. 

And in the case of Asexual, there is no way for a spectrum to exist. Asexual is"" I am not sexually attracted to either sex"". That is a yes or no question. If anything that is why Asexuality is often not included with the others. Because the definition is more ridged

&gt;I think a demisexual man could tell you that it IS a useful describer of identity and community. The criteria for it is that you are asexual except for sexual attraction to a partner that you have made a deep emotional connection with (and that you feel like demisexual is the label that best describes you, because you don't really have to meet super specific criteria to decide to label yourself someway, because again, sexuality is fluid).

We aren't talking about individual labels. I honestly don't care what someone considers themselves to be. I am talking about sexual orientation as a functional system of catagorization for society as a whole. Someone identifying as Demi is irrelevant. It doesn't work on the level of actual catagorozation. 

You also haven't addressed a key aspect of my original case. These additional labels are arbitrary. Why is ""I am attracted only in romantic contexts"" an orientation, but not ""I am only attracted to submissive people"". Or ""I am attracted to redheads"" or ""I am attracted to healthy people"". I would argue that none of these make any more sense than Demisexuality because none of them describe a sexual orientation. They are all talking about things that exist on the level of specific relationship preferences. They simply are not broad enough to be an orientation. 

&gt;I'm unclear why you brought up pansexuality as well, because that is highly different from the asexuality spectrum, and means ""I am attracted to individuals regardless of gender/gender has no importance in who I am attracted to""  

I brought up pansexual because it is the same issue. A label that has no functional purpose. A pansexual person is, by definition, bisexual. A redundant label is a useless label "
76,e6cvia7,"&gt; irrepressible manhood

The didactic approach utilized (AMAB, body shaming, sexuality) also clearly lead us to the conundrum where trans women simply cannot have sexual life/desires classified as ""healthy"", because, *in the view of the transmisogynist*, trans women are inescapably male, which means: 

* Cis hetero men shouldn't/can't feel desire for a trans woman since it's gay, and few things are more demeaning or undesirable than being gay (sometimes including death);
* Cis gay men and cis hetero women shouldn't/can't feel desire for a trans woman since the attraction would expose that she is simply a deviant male, and as such, devoided of value;
* Cis lesbian women shouldn't/can't feel desire for a trans woman since they're actually men, so this desire would be the same as the annihilation of their sexual self; 
* Bisexual people are just not attracted to trans people, or else they'd be pan; 
* And pansexual people are those freaks who fuck cars and trees, right?

This apparently insoluble proposition ‚Äî which would only be if the premise wasn't false, and it is ‚Äî is just another weapon used to portray trans people as unclassifiable kinksters because, again in the mind of the transmisogynist, a trans woman is a pervert with unclear objectives (sometimes mentioned as part of the hidden ""transgenda""). Based on the misguided notion that trans women belong to some sort of third gender/sexual category, it leaves transmisogyny ample grounds to establish that trans women are the worst kind of pervert: the sexual assaulter, deploying sophisticated trickery plots in order to fulfill their deviant and unclear (so, potentially dangerous in the maximum threat level) needs. A couple that includes a trans woman would be anything but regular, common, or healthy; it necessarily should imply that one of the two, or both, has deep enough socialization issues that they need to lower their ethic, morals and value to such a point. 

What makes this complex system of othering trans women, in every sense possible, even worse ‚Äî and giving emphasis to the sexual part ‚Äî is that it is presented as *natural*, and seeps deeply into society's imaginary as the norm, as the default; in truth, it is even implied in the category created to accommodate us, with *trans* meaning *across*, though this is a discussion for another time. Furthermore, since the transmisogynist strata established that a trans woman is an other that belongs to a third category and it's moved by a sexual perversion, every call for individual rights is framed as an invasion and a potential danger. You see this clearly in the dating discussions, when transphobia shows up but should not be named or brought up, otherwise it is an attack and an advance into a space that should not be violated, namely, one's grounds for sexuality. The dick that intrudes a safe space/scenario also symbolically forces its way into a conversation if transphobia is pointed out. ""I wouldn't ever date any trans woman, but I won't be called transphobic because that's just how my sexuality feels"" is the tip of an iceberg where layer upon layer of narrative construction serves to keep us from being seen as part of society. And once again, it presents itself as a closed circuit in which there's no reasoning possible. 

And this is why there should be no room to discuss the branches on the tree; the tree itself has to be torn down. Allowing people the ""right"" to pass judgment under the premise that trans women are something else than women, is perpetuating the discourse that inevitably keeps us marginalized. **If the premise is false, don't go further on any discussion with a transmisogynist.** Use your favorite set of data to reestablish reality ([ex1](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/), [ex2](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3rws5s/comprehensive_defense_against_antitrans_talking/), [ex3](https://reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/8vo33r/my_master_list_of_trans_health_citations_in/)).

In a broad view of society, sex is usually a man's privilege, a house planted at the top of a mountain of hypocrisy: the underlying idea of ""healthy sex life"" has to include a woman, but this woman shouldn't like it too much, else she's a whore, so devoided of value; and she surely should have all organs and chromosomes and socializations in the book, else she's an aberration. Fighting for the right of having a regular sex life like everyone else, without being seen as a deviation of any kind, necessarily needs to deal with the problem as a whole, *and in the same platform as cis women*. ""Conceding"" that trans women should be regulated under a different set of principles, or under a variable morality level, or that we should be ""mindful"" of how we walk around in the world, keeps us alien. (Reality does that by itself; there's no need to do it in the realm of principles.) And it also reinforces internalized shame ‚Äî which feeds gender dysphoria and we know how that ends ‚Äî of what should be as healthy as simple: that trans women have the right of dreaming, desiring, planning, and achieving a sexual life on their terms, be it op or non-op, without being seen as anything else but women. It's not only important to stand up on this issue, but doing it from the right angle: confronting every act of transmisogyny without being carried into the minutia of that transphobia's effects, be it external or internalized, but being firm against the underlying assumption that trans women are something else than women, and should be under an arbitrary, specific set of rules.

82,g32831c,"This may get confused for a divisive take due to sounding *similar* to divisive takes that exist, but it is not: pansexuality is, by definition, fully under the umbrella of bisexual. A pansexual person *is* bisexual."
83,fswqesq,"There is no official difference between bisexual and pansexual. Your friend was mistaken. However, it's an understandable mistake because a lot of people say incorrect things about it on the internet, so it's easy to get confused.

""Bisexual"" means being attracted to your own gender as well as other gender[s]. Some bisexual people like manly men and womanly women; some bisexual people like androgynous people. Some bisexual people strongly prefer 1 gender, some bisexual people have no preference. Some bisexual people's attraction includes non-binary and transgender people, some bisexual people's attraction excludes those people.

Pansexual people are functionally the same as bisexual, but if someone calls themselves pansexual, they're usually trying to be clear: ""I have no gender preference, someone's gender is not important when it comes to being attracted to them or not."" 

The **incorrect** thing is when pansexual people take that a step further and rewrite what bi means.... bi has been around a **lot** longer than pansexual &amp; has always included the full spectrum of being attracted to not just one gender. Just because pansexual means, ""I have no gender preference,"" it does **not** mean all bisexual people have a gender preference, for example. 

Whether somebody is attracted to masculine men and womenly women actually has nothing to do with any of this though. For example, a straight man is not less straight if he's attracted to a woman who is a tomboy. Also, trans people can be very womanly or manly looking as well, they do not always look like they're in the middle."
84,ftba0zs,"Well, we should he mindful of the feelings of others and be inclusive and accepting. They have that part right on the money. But, all the labels and shit gotta go. I don't care if you identify as a ""gender fluid femme presenting pansexual"" or whatever. I'm gonna treat you like a person regardless. If you identify male, but go out of your way to present as a female I'm not gonna apologize if I call you ""her"" and you get upset about it. I'm not going to pretend like gay, lesbian, and queer are different things. You're homosexual and I don't care. Your orientation means nothing to me and knowing it won't change what I think about you or how I treat you.

I don't even know difference between gay/lesbian and queer. I've asked people who identify as queer and they can't give a satisfactory answer either, but assure me that a gay man and a queer man aren't the same and that a lesbian and a queer woman aren't the same. When I ask how so they just get confused and say ""they just are"". Sorry, but that doesn't work. If there's no actual distinction between the terms they don't need to exist as distinct labels. And, what's the difference between pansexual and bisexual? Pansexual people are attracted to men and women equally, they say. Bisexual people are attracted to men and women equally, again as they say. So, they're functionally identical so we don't need two different terms for one thing."
85,fv5ufer,"Your question isn't ignorant at all; part of your problem is that the terms are often used in confusing ways.

In *theory* they ought to be distinct, because pansexual implies attraction to *all* genders whereas bisexual literally says ""attracted to two genders"".  But of course that's not at all how it works in the real world, because most genders lie somewhere on the male-female spectrum and bi people are generally attracted to most of them.

In real-life usage, quite a lot of people identify as bi or pan and don't treat them as different.

But a lot of people *do* treat them differently.  For example, pansexual people are usually saying they're equally attracted to agender people, whereas *some* bi people aren't.  But many bi people are.

And some pansexual people prefer to describe themselves as being attracted *only* to personality and simply not caring about gender characteristics - which I suppose isn't morally the same thing as being attracted to all genders, but may be hard to distinguish from it in practice.

Some pansexual people prefer 'pan-' because they feel that 'bi-' helps reinforce the gender binary as a term and see it as offensive.  Which I suppose in pure etymology it does, but words mean what they're used to mean, so in turn some people who identify as 'bi-' are annoyed by that argument because it takes an identity from a section of the LGBT community that has in reality done a lot of hard work erasing the gender binary, and they're annoyed to be treated otherwise just because they prefer to be called bi.

Some respond by calling the two things that the 'bi-' prefix would imply being attracted to ""my gender, and other genders"".

So, it's OK to be confused - the LGBT+ community are frankly confusing on this one, and don't always agree with each other.

The only thing I've seen everyone agree on so far is that if there are *some* genders you're never attracted to, you're not pan.

(It's also a little hard to tell if it's actually true that women actually have a more fluid approach to sexuality... or if it's just that society is more *accepting* of women having a more fluid approach to sexuality.  Very few people are so completely straight that they've *never* had *any* non-straight thought, but it may be that men are more strongly pressured not to show it.  Or it may be that those expectations shape our attractions.  It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg question.)

The real answer is that the gender and sexuality spectrum is *complicated*, and it's helpful to remember that words are only shorthand labels that we apply to bits of a big messy picture.  They'll give you a vague idea *roughly* where a person sits, but if you want to actually understand who they like you'll always need to ask them.

(I, for example, still identify as straight despite the fact all of my partners for several years have been nonbinary, so as a clear matter of definition I'm *not*.  This isn't intended to erase the nonbinary identities of my partners; it's just that in general conversation straight gives a much more realistic picture of my experience and identity than anything else, since I'm a man who is exclusively attracted to people on the female-to-agender side of the spectrum, and *never* attracted to people on the agender-through-to-male side.  I refuse to claim the bi identity, since I haven't experienced any of the problems, experiences and prejudices that come with it; I feel it would be intruding in a place where a cishet guy like me should be an ally instead.)"
86,fprg7is,"&gt; Wow! I have never heard the term dyadic. Thank you. I always say cis because its the only think I could think of.

You're clearly not ignorant of trans-related and intersex-related things, so I won't assume you're ignorant on this matter --- as a matter of fact, you probably know more than I do --- but using the term *cis/cisgender* to mean a person who is not intersex is not, as I am almost certain you're aware of, always factually true, as there are cisgender people who are not dyadic; there are intersex cis people, like there are intersex trans people.

I know that was not your reason for using the term *cis/cisgender*, but I just thought I'd point that out for anyone who is ignorant of these possibilities, despite the fact that, yes, I think overwhelmingly mist trans people are dyadic and so are most cis people; however, small the percentage of trans and cis intersex people may be, that does not negate the reality of such persons existing; moreover, it does not mean that we should not address them per se, as that *could* lead to fallacious reasoning, e.g. X person(s) are not part of the majority, thus we don't need to focus on them. It's a form of argument evasion, or at least it *could* possibly be used as such in a number of ways.
Plus, one sees this sort of argument sometimes being used against same-sex partners' marrying and the institution of same-sex marriage, as ""lesbian and gay people are only a minority. We aren't going to change things for a bloody minority of people"". Likewise, one sees this with anti-trans people: ""what?! You're asking **me** to change my speech because of a miniscule portion of the population's identifying as transgender? Go to hell""!

Yes, I know I was off topic once again, but I thought it important to write that. Sorry for rambling as per usual on my part, but some things can't be explained in one or two words, and sometimes elucidation is needed.

&gt; I appreciate that quote about bisexuality. That is a good way to explain it.

Yes, I think it's a good quote, too. It certainly helped me when I was confused about matters of one's being both neither a wholly a woman or a man or NB in some other way, but still calling oneself bisexual.

Though not totally related, I recommend you check out [this video] (https://youtu.be/BkZnFVbSKKo) by Riley Dennis in which she speaks about how one can logically be both non-binary and a woman. Yes, I know that's not what we're discussing, but I think it correlates nicely with what we're discussing, as I, too, was *so* confused about how one can be non-binary --- which simply means, as you know better than anyone else arguably --- that one is not *wholly* a woman or a man or a girl or a boy, but that does not negate the possiblity of one's being both neutrois and a woman.

&gt; Many argue theyre the same and maybe they are, but labels are for each person to identify with or not.

Yes, this is true. *Many* people, cheifly people who are either A-OK with trans women and trans men, but then say ""what""?! when one says one is or can be non-binary, say this --- **JUST LAST NIGHT I was talking with someone who this VERY THING, but this has happened before as well** --- or people who outrightly oppose *all* trans people, women, men, NB, etc. But that's just in my own personal experience.

If one accepts that there is a difference between sex and gender then one most probably accepts transness as legitimate. Transness may only be able to exist if there is a distinction between sex and gender, otherwise if sex and gender are the same, or ought or should be the same, then why are there trans people? Logically, there wouldn't be able to be, would there, as far as I can see. My thoughts on this matter, however, are still in formation, i.e. whether or not the existence of transness depends on there being a distinction between sex and gender. I think I need to study some more feminist, queer, trans, etc., theory.

The reason I wrote that paragraph, though, is to say that if definitionally the terms *pansexual/ity* and *bisexual/ity* are actually different. Plus, the people who have a bisexual or pansexual sexual orientation actually do experience different feelings from what I understand as an outsider to those sexualities. Pansexual people are typically attracted not to *anyone* or *anything* as some critics say in gest, or ""just wanting to get their leg over the first person or thing that moves"", but they *can* be attracted to people regardless of genital sex, gonadal sex, assigned sex, regardless of physical properties such as facial hair or a large(er) chest, whereas bisexual people in my experience can be more... selective for lack of a better word in that they may or may not date a trans person, but a pansexual person certainly will.

Perhaps you want to check out [this post] (https://amp.reddit.com/r/pansexual/comments/8a1au1/pansexuals_of_reddit_how_did_you_know_that_you/) addressing how pan people know they are pan and not bi. There are some gems of a comment in the thread, e.g.:

&gt; It was two reasons for me. I‚Äôm definitely a ‚Äúpeople are people, and if I like you I like you‚Äù type of gal, which I felt really aligned with pansexuality.

---

&gt; A lot of people have different definitions of different labels. For me, bi means you like 2+ genders while pan means gender doesn't really factor into who you are attracted to. I started realizing that a lot of the time, I didn't know the gender of a person but definitely wanted to fuck them anyway and then I started realizing that was pretty consistent across all my attractions.

I described the difference between bi and pan to my partner like this:

A bi and a pan person walk into an ice cream shop and are asked what ice cream they want. The bi person says, ""Well, I like chocolate and vanilla and a few other flavors.""

The pan person says, ""I don't fucking care, put ice cream in my mouth right now, any ice cream will do.""

Again, perhaps you should take it over to /r/Bisexual or /r/Pansexual as they'll be able to guide you far better than I ever could as I'm gay, not bisexual or pansexual.

---

&gt; Although there are people that understand these things differently, ie tran/NB-exclusionary bi people who necessitate that the gender and sex be cis in the people they are potentially attracted to.

Yes, there are cisgender lesbian women, many of whom in the media are self-identified radical feminists, and they claim that trans lesbian women in particular are imposing themselves on to their cis sisters (well, I call them sisters, despite their not thinking that they are actually sisters) by saying that unless one wishes to have a penis in the mix in some way in one's sexual encounters, whether that involves vaginal, anal, and or oral involvement with the penis isn't always clear, one is a bigot, a transmisogynist.

I do have to say, however, that, anecdotally speaking, I've never met a trans person, a trans woman in this case, who's said to anyone ""have sex with me or I'll denounce you as a transphobe"", but I have conversed with trans women who have said to me ""yeah, it feels AWFUL when someone says they won't be with you in a non-platonic way because of your being trans, but I can't impose myself on people, nor do I want to"". Alas, these things *have* happend. Zinnia Jones has [a case] (https://mobile.twitter.com/zjemptv/status/881284028548173824?lang=en) which was propagated across the Internet.

Ever heard of the [cotton ceiling] (https://queerfeminism.com/2012/03/27/the-cotton-ceiling-is-real-and-its-time-for-all-queer-and-trans-people-to-fight-back/)? Well, here's a [basic bit of info on it] (http://sjwiki.org/wiki/Cotton_ceiling).

&gt; As for DSD i dont like the term disorder.

That's *exactly* why I *always* say ""...differences in sex development are quite natural, and they..."", **never** ""disorders of sex development"".

&gt; Thanks for the conversation. I love being able to talk about these things and actually learn from others as well.

Likewise. I'm thoroughly enjoying myself and enjoying reading and listening to what others have to say and learning in the process."
87,fsjlu5z,"&gt; For me the problem is that it confuses sexuality

how? it feels pretty simple? someones gender and sex are not factors in whether or not a pansexual person is attracted to someone."
88,fab8sf7,"Unless they mean the exact same thing I'm still confused.

Or are we are saying that bisexual people aren't attracted to martians and mermaids but pansexual people are open to that idea? Where bisexual people would only be interested in people who consider themselves only male or female... Or both. 

Just seems like a language problem more than anything."
89,fhybp3t,"A bisexual person likes big boobs and big penises. A pansexual person is attrcacted to a character that is complimentary to theirs. No matter the physical attraction.

At least that is the formal definition. Now I don't trust, since you seem to live 6 years in the past, that you did the necessary formal scientific research to definitely prove that no person in the entire universe has ever loved someone for something else than their looks, but from my looks and what my ExGf tells me, I can comfortably tell you that I believe it is possible.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, sexuality is purely attraction. Many people can be attracted to many things. You might confuse this with gender. I can be attracted to a chair and get off on grinding against it and calling it Mary, that's none of your concern. There is no biological background to that.

However, biology knows of and has known of more than two biologically defined genders for ages. Since genome testing and DNA testing is a thing. Because some people don't have the typical composition of a XX or XY chromosome. Instead they have more or less than that. And some people lack that identifier completely. By your definition, the simple biological gender, these are all genders.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you could make an arguement of rarity. We currently don't have words for people who are neither men nor women (or are trying to implement new words) because only now are people comfortable enough to come out.

&amp;#x200B;

Or do you believe that before 1980 nobody was gay either? Dude. People got killed over dressing up as women. And even more so for kissing another man in public.

90,f1ju72f,"""Creatable World""... This is what we were talking about in the transhumanism thread, isn't it? This is what we need to be vigilant against. 

In a perfect, non-insane world, a customizable doll would be cool and fun. But take a look at the cultural packaging in which it's sold. The idea that a human being can be both or neither male and female, and that the process of picking your sex is just as easy as mixing and matching, discarding that and putting on that, is dangerous. 

That's what the agenda is. The first step, you destroy the sense of self, by cutting off ties with older women in the family/community, painting them all as prudes and TERFs and generally uncool people, and bombarding the young mind with the most horrid pornography you can imagine. Sexual trauma is very effective at personality destruction. Exposing the youth to more and more explicit violence also cannot hurt. 

The second step, you create a customisable world of fantasy - dolls, video games, photo filters - a world wherein you can choose precisely who you want to be. This will keep the subjects from suicide for long enough.

The third step, you confuse the mind with endless layers of fake intersectionality, a swimming mass of labels who stick and become unstuck at random, without much discussion on them outside ""valid and beautiful"". Have you seen those tumblr posts? ""Support black trans boys. Support white trans boys. Support Asian trans boys. Support disabled trans boys..."" or ""Kinky pansexual people are valid! Low-libido pansexual people are valid! Polyamorous pansexual people are valid!..."" just going on and on and on through every possible label? And we teach children to be nice, so they will respond to every repetition of the mantra with a ""yes"".

The fourth step, destroy the body. Starvation, obesity, puberty blockers, enviromental hormone disruptors, beauty products with shady labels, maybe even surgery. Leave it with no part of biological self - body type, face, sex - it came into this world with. Destroy the connection with the mother at the biological level. 

The fifth step, let them create their new internal self from bits and pieces that catch the eye. Polygender sapiosexual foxkin with self-diagnosed multiple personalities? Why not. Pansexual homoplatonic kinky nanoboy? Sure. Let the human shell on the Internet and make sure that every dysfunctional thought typed into Google leads you into a ""community"" of some sort.

And the final, sixth step, you let them deform the hated body in accordance to the constructed self that keeps them from losing sanity. Cosmetics, hormones and other drugs, surgery, soon enough possibly DNA modification. All that will cost money to buy and upkeep.

I mean, it's called ""Creatable World"", people. They are getting bold."
91,ewqd0wv,"Thank you very much for your detailed response! Let's dive right in.

&gt;Well, to me, sex is pretty much what you define it as. ...

Okay. Yup, we're pretty much on the same page here. I would point to genetic composition as the determinant of sex. A man who's had his genitals blown away by the blast from an IED is still a man. He's not a woman or of neither sex entirely.

I agree with your points about gender expression.

Now we get into gender identity.

&gt; Then, you have the second most straight forward group: transgender people who shift from one state of the binary to the other. Ftm (female to male) and Mtf (male to female).

Okay. I have an objection to that framing. This is where I find we begin to veer away from reality. Right off the bat, I have to ask you: Is sex immutable, or can it be overridden by one's gender identity? Isn't there a biological reality to sex which ignores a person's ideas about who they are and how they choose to express themselves? Remember: Earlier on, you defined sex in biological terms (chromosomes, penis, vagina). In order to flip from one state of the binary to the other, wouldn't one need to acquire the biological traits of the opposing binary? But when a so-called ""FTM"" undergoes genetic testing, they are sexed female. Doesn't this result suggest that one's gender identity and expression fall short of influencing one's sex? 

What you say next I find better reflects reality.

&gt;These people have dysphoria, an intense feeling that they don't fit in the body they were assigned. This dysphoria is debilitating in a lot of cases, so they go through measures to change their gender expression to match their identity. Top and bottom surgery, hormones, etc. This is also pretty straightforward, but even pre-op trans women and men still identify as a gender they weren't assigned as.

Yes. Here you begin to describe what's actually occurring. A bit of nitpicking, though: They're going through measures to change their gender expression to match their **gender** identity specifically, which is a self (subjective) description of identity and which does not comport with biological findings representing an objective determination of the person's identity. So there's a mismatch between subjective experience or understanding of one's identity and the objective, biological reality of one's identity. If I self identify as 6' tall and the ruler says 5'5"", we go with the objective finding, i.e. what the ruler says.

&gt;So men can have vaginas, and women can have penises. Here is an obvious disconnect in the sex spectrum and the gender identity spectrum.

Now I'm confused. Have you appropriated existing sex labels and redefined them for gendered usage? It's okay if you have; I'm asking because I want to get squared away on definitions. Let me attempt to break down your statement as I understand it to mean based on what I think are your definitions of ""men"" and ""women"" in a gendered sense.

So men [i.e. people who self identify as men] can have vaginas, and women [i.e. people who self identify as women] can have penises.

To this I would agree. Of course, their self identity would not be in keeping with reality, but I've already gone over that. By the way, and this is departing from your definitions for a moment, my espousal of the genetic determinancy of sex does allow for the possibility of men with vaginas and women with penises.

Your final point did clear up a lot of things for me.

&gt;Generally, when we refer to ""gender"", we're talking about gender identity.

Alright. I think we're coming closer to an understanding of one another's positions. You have the opportunity to correct any of my misinterpretations and rebut my points. I had hoped on being able to rebut your claim within your framework of gender, but now that you've detailed it, pansexuality appears to fit in there. Given what I now know, as I incorporate your notion of pansexuality into my own framework of sexuality, it appears to fit there as well, albeit with a narrowed scope.

&gt;Pansexual people are attracted to all genders, regardless of genitals, identity, or presentation.

Here it comes to mean that pansexuals are attracted to men and women, regardless of genitals, identity, or presentation. And this would appear to distinguish it from bisexuality, which isn't defined around gender identity or presentation but solely gender, itself. So you got me! Pansexuality would appear to be valid and different from bisexuality."
92,e8y0v7z,I find this stuff increasingly uncomfortable. I really have nothing against any transgender individual. But I don't want to date someone with a penis. I can't see how that makes me transphobic. Yet I'm called out on it a lot. I'm happy being friends with people with penises but I don't want to confronted by that particular appendage when having sex. It makes me queasy. I also find most transgender women more feminine than me and that makes me uncomfortable too. Mostly because I'm not attracted to super femme women. I prefer Tom boy types. So yeah I'm uncomfortable because I feel like I'm being attacked for not being attracted to every person on the planet. Yet bisexual and pansexual people are attacked for being attracted to all genders. Confused! 
93,e7vd4rd,"I'm confused why this post is acting the original person isn't making any sense? She said she is a cis woman (as opposed to trans) and that that she is bi/pansexual (pansexual people are essentially bisexual people but bisexual people are generally seen as being attracted to men and women whereas pansexual people don't even consider gender/sexual identity). Nothing she said contradicts anything else she said in that tweet and i don't believe in punching down for no reason.

Edit: I will say for semantics sake she probably should have said queer instead of homo just because kinda a bespoke term for specifically same sex relationships"
94,e84mesi,"pansexual people are attracted to all genders - male, female, non binary, gender fluid.

they‚Äôre often confused with bisexual people, but bisexual people are attracted to simply males and females"
95,e0zt28f,"They're not different genders at all. It's not just about gender - a FTM is a male, but I would not be attracted to them. My preferences aren't uncommon in the LGBTQ community. As such, someone who is more gender fluid or doesn't appear to fit into those categories may not swipe on me, because they might see it as a waste of time. If I wrote pansexual, it means I'm welcome to ALL, regardless of gender identity. I, as a bi person, am not really attracted to transsexuals or gender fluid people. A pansexual person is. It's a small difference, but those in the LGBTQ community came up with different labels for a reason - we signal to others within that community through those labels, whether those outside the community understand them or not. I think a lot of people equate gender with sexuality and that isn't the case. It's easy to confuse the two, but your sexuality isn't necessarily gender dependent, although it often is.  "
96,dqlu08l,"That's an excellent question! And one I'm kind of embarrassed to reply to... It was the first thing I read, and maybe because ""lost in translation"" or my own society's taboos and misconceptions, it just read to me as *bisexual*, especially in this part of the article:

&gt;Because pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women, and pansexuality therefore rejects the gender binary, it is often considered a more inclusive term than bisexual

I just always thought that *that* was one and the same, but then again, we haven't really opened up to the gender spectrum in my country. 

For example, I feel sexually attracted to *anyone*, I never distinguished between ""men"" and ""women"", or transgendered, or anything for that matter. In my culture, I'm mostly labeled as a ""quirky straight female"". So yeah. I'm ignorant and/or confused to say the least :')

Gender binary is still very strong in my country. The internet is my only source of exploring beyond, but lacking the bases to compare-evaluate, I get lost a lot. 

Also, I stumbled on a lot of forums and blogs, even some vlogs, and the contradictions-hate-slurs were just messing with me even more. But now it's a bit more clear! Thank you for your reply :)"
97,g21pnra,"&gt;there are many bis who understand their attraction as ""people not gender"", they r still bi

Yes, they are still bi. I believe I said that pansexual people are also bisexual, because bisexual is a very broad term. 

&gt; idk why we r splitting identities based on such incredibly minute and subjective nuances tht only rly matter to the individual

We are being nuanced *because* it matters to the individual. Isn't that really the only thing that matters here? People being able to describe their unique experiences in a way that feels right to them and can be understood by others?

&gt; srsly the whole genderblind / ""uwu i like ppl not gender"" is rly dismissive and condescending and feels really inavlidating for trans ppl. it's just the gender version of ""i don't see race.""

That's a strawman. If what you're claiming was what pan people meant when they say they're pan, I'd agree with you. However, you are fundamentally misunderstanding the position that pan people take.

&gt; pls dont tell me im pan bc i dont find gender an important factor in my attraction. it is a bi experience.

I'm not telling you that you're pan. You may identify however you like. I am saying that when pan people say that they are pan, this is what they mean (many of them, anyways).

&gt; bi ppl have been using this description for over 50 years to describe their BISEXUALITY.

And that's fine. However, *not all bi people feel this way.* When you tell people that you're bi, they don't automatically know that you like all people equally regardless of gender. Maybe you prefer women, or you only like all men but only very ""masculine"" women. People who aren't ""50/50"" in terms of their male-to-female attraction are still bi and valid, so if you *are* equally attracted to all genders equally, you'd need to say ""I'm bi, and I'm also attracted to all genders equally.""

If enough people identify with that description, they're likely to find a shorter way to say that (and they did- omnisexual.) That's only erasing bisexuality if the existence of the color ""periwinkle"" erases the color blue. Do you see how odd that sounds? 

&gt; even when i was gay i cared a lot abt personality bc i am... not abt to spend time w ppl i hate jst cus theyre men lol.

Ah, but would you find someone unattractive at first but then begin to find them very sexy after hearing them talk passionately about painting their model train collection? That's more than simply not having sex with people that you hate.

Pansexuality is a pattern where how you feel about someone will entirely and completely alter how attracted you initially were to them (in a very physical, animal sense). You said that you cared a lot about personality, but is someone's charisma and personality so incredibly determinate of your attraction to them that you'd be eager to jump the bones of someone you 'clicked' with even though you thought they ""weren't your type"" when you first saw them? Maybe you are that way, but that's certainly not how all bi people describe themselves. There's definitely room for a more specific label here.

&gt; i do not need a new label that tries to tell me that im not bi for experiencing attraction a certain way.

...and no good person is telling you that you aren't bi. If you feel the bisexual label fits you, then wear it. As they are commonly understood, the labels of ""bi"", ""omni,"" and ""pan"" are not mutually exclusive and could all be used to describe one person with no contradiction. Many pan or omni people will also identify as bi, and those identities are (to them) a more specific label that they use when talking to people who have a better understanding of the nuances of sexuality (like other queer people). You don't see profesional artists calling every shade of blue ""blue."" They can talk about violets, cyans, and periwinkles without somehow forgetting that all of these shades are blue, and the specificity of language helps them appreciate each shade more than if they were less specific. 

Maybe some pan or omni people aren't comfortable calling themselves bi. You aren't them, you don't know what they're going through or why they feel that the label of bi doesn't seem to fit them. Sometimes people have personal issues that manifest in weird ways, or they simply perceive themselves in a way that is difficult to express using existing definitions. Frankly, that's not your business. As long as they aren't lying to you (i.e. deliberately misusing a label to decieve you), you should be able to let them self-express in a way that makes sense to them. If it doesn't make sense to you, you can ask clarifying questions while remaining polite and accepting of their self-expression.

&gt; this stuff is why other people say tht other labels erase bisexuality. this stuff is exactly what im mad about.

Ultimately, having more people talk about how monosexuality isn't for everyone helps to combat bi erasure in the long term. A few instances of people being mis-labelled in the meantime is much less bad for bisexuals than excluding and invalidating pan people is. While there will always be debate over terminology, the discussion should be blanketed with the kind of respect and kindness that should be normal but that queer people often fail to recieve elsewhere.

P.S. I am very sensitive to issues such as possible trans erasure or invalidation. It is true that some pan people call themselves ""gender blind"" in the same way that privleged white people sometimes claim to be ""colorblind."" That stance *is* harmful, but that is not how the majority of pan people think. It's not that gender doesn't exist to pans (if that were true, they'd all have to be non binary), but that gender is a negligible factor in determining whether or not someone is sexually attractive to them.

Tl;dr: if you don't want to call yourself pan, then don't. That's A-ok. But let pan people decide what it means to be pan in the same way that bi people get to say what it means to be bi. No one is saying that you have to be only one or only the other, there's plenty of overlap here and no one group is trying to invalidate or erase the other. Holy dicks, can't we (on both sides of this mess) just let people exist in peace without trying to exert control over one another's narratives?

Edit: after a read of the two sources you posted, I can say that I don't much disagree with either. I would bristle a bit at the tone in some parts, but the logic is sound. As I said before, some of the criticisms of pansexuality come off as a bit of a straw man, but I recognize your concerns.

The main thing that I would say to you is that there is no need for you to attack pan people. Your tone comes off as very aggressive, and it's not helping your case. We fundamentally agree, and the source that you linked even said that he sees nothing wrong with pan people continuing to use the term pan so long as they acknowledge bisexuality for what it is and always has been. You would do well to come off as similarly non-threatening."
98,g71i92y,"The thing with bisexual vs pansexual though is that bisexual is the umbrella term that covers 2 or more genders/gender identities. So someone who is attracted to *all* of them, or are attracted to people regardless of their gender/gender identity, they are also pansexual. Someone who isn't/wouldn't be attracted to all genders/gender identities would only be bi.

I technically fit the definition of pansexual, but I go with bi because I like it better and it feels better. Plus it's important to me to spread awareness that being bisexual doesn't exclude people who are trans, enbie, etc. If we really dive into it I use the term queer more than anything, since that's just the top level umbrella term that gets the entire LGBTQA+ community underneath it.

Every square is a rhombus but not every rhombus is a square. Every pansexual person is bi but not every bisexual person is pan."
99,fxcy5tw,"&gt;Yeah most people call that being bi. Pansexual and Bi apparently mean the same exact thing. People just want to feel special. Also I like how gay people NOW claim legality equals morality. By that logic being gay is as wrong in the middle east as beastality is in America.

What's really astounding here is that you deleted the comment where you asked if pansexual people are into ""illegal things like animals"", then proceeded to write this hateful little diatribe instead.

I really have no clue what point you're trying to get across at the end, but it seems like you have a tremendous fascination with queer people fucking animals. You should really get that checked out."
100,g840l92,"Two Spirit is a non-binary, or third gender that is mostly present in Native American culture (to my knowledge, many, but not all tribes had/have have this).  It's more of an American term since it focuses on those cultures.  Essentially, they're recognized as having elements of male and female, but what defines that is more based on the individual or community a person exists in.

Bisexual and pansexual have a ton of overlap and are pretty interchangeable.  I personally use both; bisexual in not-so-educated or safe settings, and pansexual in queer-friendly spaces.  The way I define it is that bisexuals can be attracted to any gender, but one's gender still plays a factor in regards to if the person is attracted to them or not.  Pansexual...just remove gender entirely from the question or formula of attraction.  One's gender plays no role in regards to if a pansexual person is attracted to them or not.  There are no universal definitions for either, and they will vary based on who you ask.  **The big thing to understand about bisexual and pansexual people is that they are not straight, and they are not gay.**

So yes OP, your idea of pansexual is right for the most part.  It doesn't necessarily mean ""have relationships.""  It ONLY refers to attraction.  Some pansexual people only date certain genders, but it doesn't mean they aren't attracted to others."
101,fswgg8e,"I just really bristle at any definition of pansexual that rewrites what bisexual means. I do agree I think making it the phrase to be about gender instead of parts makes it more accurate (and less rhyming unfortunately) but I don't like the idea of rewriting bisexuality, which has existed a long time, to fit around pansexualilty, a new phrase. Personally, the way it fits together for me is that pansexual people are ""functionally"" bisexual but want their label to emphasize that they don't have a gender preference and are open to trans/nb people. Which is totally fine, but I don't think we can therefore turn around and say bisexual people are the opposite yknow? Like sure lots do have gender preferences but lots don't; lots are open to nb/trans people and lots aren't. 

Personally when I'm around straight people I say I'm bisexual, because that's the term they understand, but around other queer people I say ""I'm bi or pan or whatever"" because I get annoyed when people (usually who identify as pansexual) try to define bi for me üòÇ I've had people tell me I'm basically pan because my preferences align with their definition of it and like, that's fine, but I have no attachment to that label and there's no official distinction between them!"
102,g258mse,"&gt;But now on the other side...I think what you might not see is that bisexuality and the use of the prefix ""bi"" does have a restrictive connotation to outsiders. ""Bi"" does mean ""Two"" and while it's not what the word actually means and not what it ever meant. It is how it seems and outside of bi spaces even in lgbt spaces. We have no way to know that or to be sure of that. So sure, us lgbt people we might get informed on that and willing to listen but for cis het people outside of the community, they have no reason to do any of that work. It's already good if they'd recognize it as an identity in itself. You can say all you want ""words change"" ""language evolve"" and it's true but outsiders didn't follow that change. When they see ""bi"" they'll see ""two"". Does that sound so outrageous that some bi people would  reject the prefix bi because of this connotation and feel like pan is a better way to represent what they feel ? Especially when it's newer generation who aren't that aware of the Bi manifesto and Bi history.

I think you might be mistaken as to how ""outsiders"" understand what ""bisexual"" is. If you ask any random person on the street what a ""bisexual"" is, most of them will already be familiar with the term and will likely say some version of ""it's someone who likes (dates, sleeps with, etc) both men and women.""  Now when they say ""both men and women,"" are they implying that non-binary or gender non conforming people are excluded from that? No. They likely don't even know what those are.  People outside of queer spaces use ""men and women"" as shorthand for ""everybody.""

For all of human history, the overwhelming majority of people have used ""men and women"" to mean ""everybody."" Most people aren't as well educated on the gender spectrum as your average queer-identifying person. Until very recently, the idea that there could even be more than two genders or that gender was not a binary was unknown to pretty much anyone who wasn't personally affected by it.  Even the idea that a trans person was anything other than ""a man in a dress"" is fairly new to most people. It's only within the past 10 years really that non-binary identity has even started to be understood outside of the queer community and even inside most parts of it. Most people still don't know what a non-binary person is, and they definitely don't know what a pansexual person is. Pansexual is most definitely not a less confusing term for a cishet person to understand that bisexual.

Bisexuals (for better or worse) have been part of mainstream culture for decades. Everyone knows and recognizes what the general concept of bisexuality is. It's not an obscure or confusing term to anyone who isn't thinking too hard about it. This assumption that most people don't know what bisexuality is and will mistake the ""bi"" to mean ""only people who identify as one of two select genders, namely men and women"" is silly, to say the least.

I grew up in an extremely conservative household.  I was very sheltered, but even with such limited exposure, I knew what a straight person was, what a gay person was, what a lesbian was, and what a bisexual person was, and so did everyone around me.  I may have simplified the definition (as most people do) but not out of a desire to exclude people who don't identify a certain way.  I didn't even know there were people who didn't identify as man or woman back then so how could I, or anyone else, assume a definition that would exclude people who aren't a man or woman?  I didn't learn about non-binary gender identities until after I came out and actively immersed myself in queer culture."
103,fovr5ky,"So, the ""old"" definition is that bisexual people are only attracted to gender binary people whereas pansexual people are attracted to anyone, regardless of gender-identity. Pansexuality is also more explicitly inclusive of binary trans-people, though that is technically included in bisexuality.

Many bisexuals don't like that definition, because most bisexuals are attracted to non-binary people anyways. There is a newer definition that, at least among young queer people I would say is more common:

Bisexuality means you are attracted to different attributes in different genders. Often classic masculinity in men and classic femininity in women. Pansexuality means you are attracted to people, completely regardless of their gender.  

Also, congrats for pulling yourself out of there."
104,frsumd1,"I am absolutely not the kind of person to get all rubbed up about these issues all day but...

No bi activist or bi activist organization has ever defined bisexuality as only liking cisgender men and women, and while there are enough bi people, just like gay and straight people, that may not want to date or screw trans people, they have never been given an extra sexuality that is even ""more queer"". A homosexual man that is attracted to cis men and trans men is gay, just gay, so why is that a difference for bisexuality? Why does bisexuality need an extra ""more queer"" version?

Bisexuality isn't also just defined as ""attraction to men and women/two genders"", bisexuality is just as much used to describe two types of attraction, the attraction to their own gender and the attraction to people of other genders.

It's transphobic and biphobic to say that a pansexual person is different from a bisexual person because they're attracted to ""men, women, and transgender people"", implying that teans people aren't really men and women and bisexuals couldn't even be attracted to them anyway.

Bisexuals have been pushed away from homophobic straight people but also from biphobic other non-straight people again and again for not being queer enough, for ""not being decent enough to pick a side"", and to be accepted they had to be pushed to say that they're lesbian, gay or simply queer, forced to pick a closet from both straight and gay people. Gay and straight people aren't pressured into giving up the language they use to describe their attraction, not like they should be, so why do we have to do so? As usual it's bisexuals being shamed into erasing our identities.

The whole discourse, in the end, is just a huge ""cis vs genderqueer"" debate. There are enough genderqueer bisexuals, like Meg John Barker and Jen Yockney, showing that bisexuality is not non-binary erasure."

106,fepd629,"Ehhh. They're so close sometimes I don't know the real difference. Of course each individual is different but I usually come across cases where a person who is bisexual is attracted to cis people.

107,f5jqm6r,"In theory pansexual people are interested in people with gender identities both in and outside of the gender binary, while bisexual people are interested in anyone that falls within the gender binary. Some people who identify as bisexual are only interested in cis people. 

In reality many bisexual people are actually pansexual, but identify as bisexual for convenience as people are way more familiar with bisexuality. I find those who identify as pansexual have a wide variety of what that means to them, and it ends up a sort of catch all similar to identifying as queer."

112,epvk867,"&gt;Please tell me how pansexual is different than bisexual?

Bisexual people are attracted to Men and Women, specifically their attraction could be described as towards the primary and secondary sex characteristics of both Men and Women

Pansexual people are capable of feeling sexual attraction to anyone regardless of their sex characteristics, and are often more likely and more comfortable with dating the wide variety of non-binary identities and intersex people

But neither of these are linear definitions as sexuality is fluid : )

&gt;The intersex people I've talked to have said the opposite! The people you talked to obviously identify as trans! Good for them, not all intersex people do.

And not all don't

You are literally arguing that ""some intersex people feel different"" and that argument could be applied the exact other direction to include them and let them choose to identify as queer if they wish instead of full stop excluding them, lmao."
113,erps9zd,"I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt, so I went through all the hoops to access this article through my university: And it doesn't even mention ""pansexual"" *once*. 

So while a pansexual person could possibly have chosen queer or bisexual as their orientation for purposes of the study, or could be one or some of the trans or two-spirit people in the study, there's nothing in the article to indicate that because pansexuality wasn't even taken into full account. This journal article does absolutely *nothing* to support the notion that ""many"" pansexual people *specifically* refuse to date trans people. This says to me that you didn't actually read the article you're trying to cite here, or at least didn't read it well since it doesn't actually seem talk about pan people. 

However, we can look at the bisexual/queer/trans responses and see that these individuals didn't identify that they'd 100% date trans people either, though they were notably more inclusive than the results of straight and gay participants. The article doesn't specify exact reasons for why, but there are a lot of reasons this is possible. For example:

* Transphobia. Simply put, being attracted to someone *doesn't mean* that you can't also have prejudice against them. Cisgender, straight male misogynists date and marry cisgender women all the time. There are people who say they're attracted to certain groups of people but would never actually date them or get into a serious relationship with them. Anyone can be transphobic: Straight, gay, bi, pan, it's not a problem specific to one orientation. In fact, I'd speculate pansexual people are less likely to be transphobic than some others as many pan people I know specifically choose the label to make *sure* their nonbinary partners know they're validated in the relationship. Additionally, I see the label used about equally between cisgender and transgender individuals, though this is anecdotal. 
* Fear. Even if the individual isn't transphobic, dating a trans person is an experience many cisgender people are not prepared for and don't know how to approach. Many don't know what to do sexually if the individual has genitalia that's not what was anticipated, and many don't know how to handle the hate that can be sent *their* way for dating a transgender individual. 

Are these reasons good ones? If by good you mean ""reflective of a lack of prejudice against trans people"" then no, because society influences our attractions and what we see as desirable more than many of us would like to admit.  More relevant to your question though, is there anything to indicate this type of transphobia in dating is more of a problem among pansexual people than any other orientation, and deserves to be called out in this specific manner? Also no."
114,epfhlyf,"But in 90% percent of cases they are.

Yeah, pansexual people are also attracted to NBs, gender-queer and everything that is between male and female, but these people are a minority.

115,ek1o8rm,Sounds like your friends really weren't your friends. Pansexual people are a valid part of our community and Queer people of every shade should accept and respect that. I'm sorry you've had such shit luck with our community so far. *hug*
116,el2kizy,"Bisexuality functions as a community label as much as a personal identity label. It encompasses everyone who is attracted to people of more than one gender, regardless of how they personally identify. Some people choose to personally identify as ""queer"" or reject all labels entirely. Some people identify as bisexual, and some people identify as pan. But the broader bisexual community is here for *all these people*.

""Pansexual"" functions more as a personal identity label than as a community label. A person who is pansexual is further specifying that they are attracted to be people *regardless* of gender. Gender isn't even a factor for them. Pansexual people are definitely attracted to people of more than one gender, so they fall under the umbrella, but it further specifies that they don't have a gender preference for partners--they're not more attracted to men, women, non-binary folk, etc."
117,ei8q2ss,"I think the distinction between whether someone identifies as bisexual or pansexual comes down to whether that person prioritizes history or etymology.

Personally, I treat bisexual as an umbrella term that includes pansexual-- that's my current understanding on the matter, anyway, and I certainly don't disparage anyone who has reached a different conclusion. As a result, I don't think there needs to be a P in the acronym, but I absolutely think pansexual people are part of the community.

Queer is a word that has a long history as a slur, as do most LGBT+ labels. Gay was used the same way. Because of that history, some people feel uncomfortable about the word, and that's understandable and justified. At the same time, they don't get to tear down anyone who seeks to reclaim that slur for themselves."

She is no different than a cis woman that has a hormonal imbalance that makes her produce more testosterone (that is a real thing that happens) and no one would ever deny a woman like that, so why are trans women any different? And if I swing at a cis male, I fully expect to get hit back. 

For my sexuality, I am pansexual. People are people to me. I don‚Äôt care what their gender is or what‚Äôs between their legs.

And I do think it's an issue for someone, especially someone who's not bisexual,  to decide on a one-size-fits-all definition of bisexuality that conflicts with how many in the community use it. A lot of bisexual people are attracted to non-binary individuals. 

Both bisexual and pansexual people are capable of feeling attracted to more than one gender. That's it. Any differences are connotative and down to personal preference. Some people use both bi and pan to describe themselves depending on the context. Some people like pan better because it feels broader or more inclusive to them. Some people prefer bi because it's what they grew up with.

Most people think the difference is that pan people are attracted to non-binary people, and in fact I think pan was coined as a way to sound more inclusive (though I could be wrong). However in my experience, most bi people ARE inclusive of nonbinary people, they simply got attached to the word bisexual before they learned the word pansexual, or they use it to denote that while they are attracted to more than one gender, they still have different preferences in regards to each gender or that attraction to each gender feels different, whereas pansexual people are seen to be attracted to someone literally completely regardless of their gender or sex.

Fact is it's all a bunch of linguistic hooey and I generally just say people are what they say they are. I call myself pan because when I found the word it felt right, but other people have basically the same orientation as me and prefer to use bisexual. Who knows *shrug* we all queer."

Who would have known that using straight people's definitions aren't good. 

We should note that the scientific meaning of bisexuality is specific; ie ""attraction to the two sexes"". The *actual* definition (being reclaimed), the one used by bi people &amp; bi advocacy websites is typically along the lines of ""attraction to more than one gender"". 

See here; https://bisexual.org/?qna=doesnt-identifying-as-bisexual-reinforce-a-false-gender-binary, http://www.biresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BRC_Brochure_2010.pdf, https://books.google.com/books?id=CbJaZIosLwQC&amp;pg=PT27&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false, http://binetusa.blogspot.com/2014/01/1990-bi-manifesto.html

The manifesto is ***especially*** relevant to you &amp; your bigotry;

&gt;**We are tired of being analyzed, defined and represented by people other than ourselves, or worse yet, not considered at all**. We are frustrated by the imposed isolation and invisibility that comes from being told or expected to choose either a homosexual or heterosexual identity.

&gt;Monosexuality is a heterosexist dictate used to oppress homosexuals and to negate the validity of bisexuality.

&gt;Bisexuality is a whole, fluid identity. **Do not assume that bisexuality is binary** or duogamous in nature: that we have ""two"" sides or that we must be involved simultaneously with both genders to be fulfilled human beings. **In fact, don‚Äôt assume that there are only two genders**. Do not mistake our fluidity for confusion, irresponsibility, or an inability to commit. Do not equate promiscuity, infidelity, or unsafe sexual behavior with bisexuality. Those are human traits that cross all sexual orientations. Nothing should be assumed about anyone‚Äôs sexuality, including your own.
We are angered by those who refuse to accept our existence; our issues; our contributions; our alliances; our voice. It is time for the bisexual voice to be heard.

How about we listen to what bi people have to say; ie ""we're not binary"". Your entire argument has been criticized by the bi community for ages because it's one of the ways that bi people have been persecuted. 

&gt;If you think universal agreement is too lofty, can we at least agree that changing the definitions in every dictionary (except the secondary definition in Merriam-Webster) and rewriting the entire Wikipedia article would be a good first step? Considering many of the resources out there hammer home that bisexual is about two, the word has a serious branding problem.

Yes, but *bisexual people* don't have power to change dictionaries. 

&gt;I read several articles on biphobia and nothing I have said here appears biphobic to me except that I don't want to date a bi person - but by the same token, I also wouldn't date a straight man or a lesbian who extended their sexuality to all AFAB people.

But you're literally excluding nonbinary people because you think that they are being exclusive &amp; transphobic. Nonbinary people and trans people that identify as bisexual that are attracted to nonbinary people. There is no distinction between that person &amp; a pansexual person except the label, so that's the ***only reason*** that you're refusing to date this person. 

&gt;I'd certainly never tell anyone ""I would date you, but you're bi and that's gross,"" I'd come up with a different way to say I'm not interested. I'm not trying to hurt people, just protect myself from inevitable questioning and dysphoria.

Another reason you're biphobic. You're making disgusting assumptions about what bi people are attracted to. You're assuming ""oh X person is attracted to me so that means that I don't look like my gender"". You're *assuming* that we aren't attracted to nonbinary genders. It's a false, ugly assumption that permeates biphobia everywhere. 

&gt;I'm not really sure how I can be accused of biphobia other than my dating preferences when I have zero problem with the people or culture, identify strongly with/love both, and only have an issue with the name. I love bisexual history, accomplishments, and everything else. 

""I can't see how I'm being transphobic for my dating preferences"" -&gt; not an excuse. Keep that tired shit elsewhere. 

&gt;What I don't love is that this label has a lot of different meanings to different people.

Next up you're going to say we can't use the word woman because it has a lot of different meanings. ***Every*** single sexuality label means something different to different groups. Even pansexual; people who define it as ""attraction to all genders"", people who define it as ""attraction to a person independent of gender expression/gender identity"". If you're gonna use etymology, pansexual people are attracted to animals, children and dead bodies, but this is obviously not the case. And ironically, the origin meaning of pansexuality is not how it is currently used. Freud defined pansexuality as how sexual energy and desire are the basis for all human interaction in life. If you actually care about how people use it, then you'd excise yourself from the homophobic, transphobic &amp; nonbinaryphobic history of Freud. 

&gt;I'm really tired of people seriously missing the point every time I try to have this conversation, so this is the last I have to say about it. 

We don't miss the point. It's that you miss our points. 

&gt;I'm not attacking any of you and y'all can obviously keep using bisexual if you want to, I just don't think language that is often exclusionary (according to major dictionaries and many of the sources I read to make sure I'm not mistaken) shouldn't be used for an inclusive identity. 

The first thing you said was that my identity was exclusionary 

&gt;That's literally the only point I've been making this entire time. Word 1 means A and B, word 2 only means B, why don't people who identify as B just use word 2, since that's the only meaning of it?

History, familiarity, community. 

Why don't straight people create a new sexuality that's ""heterotranssexual"" that explicitly includes trans people. Heterosexual/straight people can exclude trans men &amp; women, and a lot do. Yet you're not here refusing to date straight people because a subset of them are exclusive. *That's* why it's so biphobic. 

Exactly same analogy applies for gay people (some gay people are exclusive and ID as gay, why not create a new term)

I ID as both bisexual and pansexual in different spaces, they're not mutually exclusive. 

See

&gt;In one study analyzing sexual identities described as alternative terms for bisexual or bi-self labels, ""half of all bisexual and bisexual-identified respondents also chose alternative self-labels such as queer, pansexual, pansensual, polyfidelitous, ambisexual, polysexual, or personalized identities such as 'byke' or 'biphilic'


Also another good analogy is comparing MTF &amp; FTM labels and how they've been criticized;

&gt;Although ‚Äúmale to constructed female‚Äù transsexuals claimed to be against the stereotyped gender system by virtue of their escape from stereotypical masculinity, they in fact added force to the binary system by merely escaping from one stereotype to another, or at most mixing together different stereotypes, rather than advocating true gender freedom. They were not political radicals, as they claimed, but reactionaries seeking to preserve a stereotypical gender system that was already dramatically changing due to the political action of 60s and 70s feminists and gays.

123,e0a1wy0,"Your answer:
Bisexuality existing does not disprove more than 2 genders existing - just like being a gay male doesn't disprove the existence of women. Being a lesbian doesn't disprove the existence of men.
That's why ""Queer"" and ""Pansexual"" are included. 
Bisexual, in this context, can mean you are attracted to male &amp; female, but you're not necessarily attracted to nonbinary people. Pansexual people are attracted to the whole gender spectrum. This is the difference. 

"
124,dzo34hi,"I think there's a happy medium, here. ""Too many"" labels can become an issue when the communities they describe become unnecessarily diluted or when people place a huge amount of importance on using the exact right label. I absolutely agree that it isn't necessary to describe every single characteristic of how you experience attraction or your gender identity when labeling yourself. Those details can be expressed in conversation. And when I see (mostly younger) people seriously debate whether they should call themselves genderfluid or genderflux, or if a demigirl or genderqueer, I think they're putting a lot of unnecessary pressure on themselves and are missing the point of these labels. These aren't wholly distinct communities, and I think there's some danger in deciding that non-binary people and genderfluid people are two different groups or that bisexual people and pansexual people are two different groups.

But sometimes people just prefer a particular label because it feels right, or because it's the label they've been exposed to the most in their own community. If a label works in the context that it's being used, there's nothing wrong with having it. Just because pansexual isn't technically *needed* doesn't mean that it doesn't serve a purpose--it's a label that's gained popularity over the years because a lot of people do like it. You could really say this about any label. Language evolves over time. ""Gay"" wasn't always a default label for being homosexual. ""Lesbian"" refers to the island of Lesbos. One of the dictionary definitions of ""bisexual"" is possessing both male and female reproductive parts, but I've never actually seen it used that way. And sometimes when a label does become commonly recognized enough, it's helpful for people.

The labels that people use can also be context-dependent. I'm genderfluid when I'm talking to people who know what genderfluid means. I'm non-binary or ""don't identify strictly as male or female"" when I'm talking to people who are possibly less familiar with terminology. I'm usually bisexual, but I'm queer or gay in contexts where I want to be clear that I'm not interested in dating men."
125,dychr0m,"Actually... 
&gt;‚ÄúShe initially identified as bisexual, she clarifies, ""but then later I read about pansexuality and was like, ‚ÄòOh, these are things that I identify with **too**.'‚Äù

Pansexual is an identity under the bisexual umbrella. Pansexual people are generally bisexual, but not all bisexual people are pansexual. She‚Äôs also used the term queer interchangeable with these two (Q.U.E.E.N. was originally titled Q.U.E.E.R.), and also ‚Äúfree-ass motherfucker‚Äù, which is a label I shall now be adopting for myself. "
126,e1lbnag,"Basically pansexual and bisexual are the same. Almost.

The trouble with ""bisexual"" (for some) is that it views a bisexual person as one who is ok with girly women and manly men. The ""pansexual"" word refers to a gender continuum: a pansexual person is comfortable with men and women, but also with androgynous people and the various flavours of gender queer."

Even if she was bisexual, that wouldn't mean she loved you any less - bisexual or pansexual people are able to be attracted to more genders, that's all.

So what, my characters in DnD are various sexualities - that doesn't mean I love my BF less.  He and I joked about all the weird trysts he got up to whilst playing The Witcher. Which - for the record, isn't cheating because these are not real people, and romancing an NPC in a game, as a character, is not real life.  I'd probably romance a female character out of boredom. Why not? Its a game. 

It's a fictional game that she's playing for fun. Presumably you've played videogames and done stuff in them that you wouldn't do in real life."
130,fr8vuyl,"Are your friends teens on Tumblr, by any chance? There's a lot of weird ideas going around there at any given time.

Some people argue that bisexual is transphobic because bi means two, and therefore 'bisexual' implies there's only two genders. 

Many of the people who argue that are pansexual, and are pansexual specifically because they don't want to use bisexual because they think bisexual is transphobic. Therefore, some bisexual people assume that all pansexual think that, and all pansexual people are biphobic, as well as transphobic because it's sort of implying that transgender people are a third gender.

TL;DR: It's complicated and dumb."
131,frm8uu6,"I would agree but all pansexual people are incidentally encouraging this behavior by identifying with pan, i dont by any means think pan people are bad and most of them are super chill but the issue is their sexuality deliberately comes from a misunderstanding of bisexuality and what it means (im also talking about modern pansexuality not Freud hes weird and pansexualism doesn't have any say over pan folks)"
132,fs0fyl0,"I gather that your table is young, and that's not a bad thing or a judgment, just a note that developmentally, some of this is to be expected. :)

It sounds like (if the ""he got weird about the pansexual"" person is also the DM? if not then also include the players here) your DM has some difficulty with separating IC and OOC, for example he can't seem to grasp that ""the druid has a crush on the gunslinger"" is a very different thing from ""demon_ilk has a crush on the gunslinger's player."" I don't want to make assumptions about what might be going on in his head as to *why* he feels this way (although of course I am, like you do), but it might just be worth approaching him from *this* angle. That is, the ""IC is different from OOC"" talk. You might be able to figure out what makes *him* uncomfortable (the idea that he might have to flirt back with you, as NPCs? I'm sure he'd be happy to hear you have no intention of playing a sexualized character) or set some basic expectations/ground rules to help him overcome his objections."

I would love to see some evidence for that. Higher compared to heterosexual people, or what?

Edit: I am majorly weirded out. It's true, in the USA at least. Since this is the area that's important for the study, I guess I just have to get over my ""how the f*ck"" moment.

It is however not true in my country, as far as I could find, which is probably the reason I'm so stunned. Maybe the treatment of LGBTQ+ people by doctors is wildly different here, I don't know. And I have heard many a tale about how USA sex education in schools is pretty useless, so ... I guess??

Still. Holy shit. I hope you all are ok, that you have good doctors, access to medical care and please participate in this study if you qualify, because blackheads like me obviously need that kind of education."
134,f9oijf8,"For me, as a person who identifies as bisexual, it means that I'm attracted to most gender identities. Pansexual people are attracted to people regardless of gender identity.

But moving on, pansexual/bisexual/polysexual are quite similar but there are subtle differences.

Bisexual: likes male and female, sometimes non binary

Pansexual: likes people regardless of gender

Polysexual: likes more than one gender (for example, female/non binary)

The main difference between bisexual and pansexual is that pansexual people are attracted to people without gender being a factor, and bisexual people usually like males for masculine qualities and females for feminine qualities."
137,f1bkhhb,"I have some experience with this. One of my exes was kind of like this. She didn't identity with any sort of sexuality. There wasn't a ""pansexual"" or any of that when this happened. She was attracted to people regardless of what they had. We talked about it one day and came to the agreement of having a threesome with another woman. The line of thought was exactly what she had. I satisfied her need for men so she didn't want to have sex with other men, but I couldn't satisfy her need for women. I'm not gay so I don't have need to sleep with other men. So it came down to just her wanting sex with another woman. We had a threesome with another woman. It was different. But exactly like what you are going through, she got upset and pissed when I did certain things to the other woman when we did it. She got mad that I kissed her, and she got livid when I penetrated her. She wanted free reign to do as she pleased during it but got jealous when I did certain things she deemed ""too intimate"". We ended up agreeing to some terms about what is acceptable during these threesome's we would have when her urge to be with a woman became too strong. Looking back, they were all based off her and what she felt was acceptable and what she wouldn't get jealous over. We had a total of 3 threesome's. The first one was a weird bonding experience the next day. The others not so much. Long story short. It didn't work out. It opened doors that shouldn't have been opened. It led to her getting too intimate with another man. It led to me thinking about being with other women and trying to find a way to have a threesome with them. It wasn't good. She was pansexual but she also wasn't monogamous. It sounds as if your girl is exactly the same. Pansexual people are just like you and I, except they just are attracted to everyone. There's no part of that that says they are cheaters or don't want monogamous relationships. Your issue has nothing to do with her sexual orientation and more to do with her not wanted to be fully committed. It's a pretty safe bet it's not going to end well with this girl. Sit down and talk to her about your feelings about this. Let her know it's a deal breaker if she sleeps with another woman. If you're in it just for fun, then bring up the idea about the threesome's. But if you're in it for the long haul, I'd definitely have a conversation about you guys maybe calling it quits."

anyways i view pan based on this ""pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women, and pansexuality therefore rejects the gender binary"" tho i agree it probably would be better to find another term tho i dont know of such a thing."
140,dzodzdt,"[GP96\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/GP96_) is effectively correct, but I feel like it's a little misleading to explain pansexual in terms of ""bisexuality, but different.""  To use a convenient analogy, it would be like explaining Star Wars as ""Like Star Trek, but different.""  Yes, there are many similarities between Star Wars and Star Trek, but they're still coming from completely different places, and just happen to have some parallels.

Interestingly, I feel like it would be more correct to say the bisexuality is ""like being straight, except you're also gay at the same time"" or vice versa.  Ignoring the possibly politically sensitive issue of which you put first \- the straightness or the gayness \- the point with bisexuality is that you're attracted to two genders: men, and women.  Now, I know that's probably misleading in it's own way... but what I mean is that it's closer to fair, not that it's exactly correct either.

Anyway, with pansexuality, a major point is that you're attracted to people \*regardless\* of their gender, and possibly regardless of things like species as well.  It doesn't mean that you can be attracted to literally anything \(a lot of people think that the droids thing is weird, for instance\) and it doesn't mean that you are attracted to literally everyone.  But it means that what attracts you to a person isn't based in gender at all \- you'll be attracted to the qualities you find attractive whether a person is a man, women, or genderless shape\-shifting alien.

In contrast, while some bisexual people can use the term bisexuality and mean the same kind of thing... I get the impression that a lot of bisexual people aren't necessarily attracted to the same qualities in women as they are in men.  At least that's what I think pansexual people are trying to distance themselves from, at any rate.  For a bisexual person, it would make sense that you could be attracted to submissive women, but dominant men, or vice versa... but the point of a pansexual person saying that ""gender doesn't matter"" is to say that they're attracted to the same qualities in all people, regardless of gender.  So... if submission is attractive to them, then it's as attractive in a man as it is in a women.  Similarly, if red hair or full lips are attractive, then they're no more or less attractive on men, ect."

143,e0rcfrl,"I've never heard of this, and I'm not surprised it's fake...

I kind of feel like some people could use some explanations of the terminology. Bisexual, in its most pedantic meaning means a person who is attracted to two genders. A pansexual person is someone who can find people attractive regardless of that persons gender identity, meaning that to someone who is pansexual (Like myself) gender isn't as important. A bisexual person, if we go by the previously stated definition, is only attracted to people who are specifically one of two genders, usually male or female. *However* both humans and language are complicated! How many of you know the exact dictionary definitions of all the groups you belong to? Probably none, because that's not what we go by. Language and sexuality is fluid, it's not a fixed unchanging point.

As I mentioned, I'm pansexual, *by the dictionary defintion of the word*. However, me and many other pansexuals use both pan and bi. At least for me, it's simply to make it easier. A lot of people have never heard of pansexual, but everyone sort of knows what bisexual means. Very few people outside the lgbtq-community would question my attraction to a non-binary person if I had told them I'm bisexual. Within that community, there might be some confusion, but in those situations I also find it easy to say I'm pan but use both pan and bi in both situations, as that's common among pansexuals anyway. I even think it's possible pan might disappear and we'll use bisexual to mean both that and it's current meaning, because bisexual is already so broad that I don't think adding pan to the mix makes it that much more confusing.

And thank you for pointing this out to people. I'm sick and tired of lgbtq-people and feminists being portrayed as wanting to make everything offensive! Yes, *of course* there's people like that! Every community has them, but they're a small fringe group. Most of us are reasonable people who don't think it's offensive to be attracted to only men or women and for whatever reason finding no attraction towards non-binary people. I am *certain* that if the person reading this thinks of one of their own communities, they'll find stereotypes about that group based on a small loud minority, and that's how it is here in the cases when it's a real oppinion. There are going to be embarassing people, weird ideas, errors, people you'd rather never have to associate with... That's how it works when you're part of a large community, especially a political one!"
144,ebd2sj9,"It's not a good thing for them to do, but I do understand why a lot of bisexual/pansexual people are inclined to hide their sexual orientation in the beginning... They're probably afraid of being rejected or treated badly.

Obviously that's not you, but they're not gonna know that on the first date (or even the first several dates -- depends on when/if the topic of bisexuality or pansexuality comes up). Most likely, once they were aware of your accepting attitude, they would have told you the truth. "
145,fyabs6m,"First off, thank you so much for replying to that comment. I know, it's the most ignorant sounding one in my post but that's because it's the one I need to know the answer to from peoples experiences. I know it sounds mean and ignorant to say ""wishy-washy"" but I couldn't come up with a better way to ask, while still putting enough emphasis on it for someone to reply. 

I understand that many bisexual people are attracted to people the exact same way that pansexual people are, so that's fine. The difference is mainly that not ALL of them are. It's just confusing to have a specific label that also remains so vague, since what bisexuality entails is person-specific rather than all-encompassing. 

I'm also NB (genderfluid) and yes I agree with the fact that we generally don't mind being read as whatever sexuality, but there is definitely an issue where we need to ""pick"" a gender expression. Though, while being NB definitely does not erase gay/lesbian people, I personally do feel invalidated as gender-fluid if any binary-sexuality person was to say they had an interest in me. This is obviously not the case with every NB person, but just my personal experience with it, since it feels as though they only see me and are dating me as the x gender that they are attracted to, and not my full identity. (Which has happened as I've dated many cis-straight males, which may be my own fault, but I like who I like.)

Yes I agree with you about the legal rights part, I even mentioned it in the last paragraph. Pan people would definitely not have the rights we do if it weren't for the history of bi/lgbtq2A+ people fighting for them. However, I've noticed that more young people are identifying as pan than bi, and this may be because they did not participate in the major fights from history, because they are uneducated about them, or they are fighting the legal wars NOW with the pan label, which I feel should be just as valid, since rights for bi people are rights for pan people and vice versa. The respect towards bi history should always remain, though. 

""And here's the other area where I'm highly skeptical about pan advocacy. There doesn't seem to be much beyond asking why bi people don't change, and why bi people are so horrible."" I think the reason I've seen so much about this internal war against the labels is because I keep seeing many more panphobic posts lately. I'm not sure if that's because of pan people having been biphobic in the past (seeing as some claim the label as born out of biphobia), but honestly a ""who started it"" isn't really the right way to go, regardless. I don't mind any sexuality, nor if anyone does keep a certain gender out of their sexuality, it's their sexuality so it's their choice. I know everyone has different opinions on this so I'd imagine you've met with a fair share of closed-minded people (which is awful and definitely frustrating.) 

I think that pan is just a more specific form of bi, and that works for some people. Honestly, since pan is the same thing as bi I still don't fully understand why so many bi people are against pan, since they are technically of the same sexuality. Not all bi people are pan, though, which is why I feel like if someone wants to label themselves with the differentiation, it makes sense to. 

Apologies for writing so much, but thank you again for helping me understand."
146,fn0w5rq,"One thing I've noticed a lot of the debates devolve into is an argument about gender. This isn't. There are two sexes, and both bisexual and pansexual people are attracted to them (There are arguments about intersex people, but it's generally considered very discriminatory to call an intersex person an ""other"" third sex, though most who use this argument have never bothered to ask one). Gender is an ongoing, fluid debate/concept that doesn't really apply here.

So at its core, they're the same. The problem is that bisexuals already suffer from erasure and discrimination by both homophobic straight people and biphobic homosexuals, and further diluting our presence isn't helping the matter. This automatically puts the two at odds and why you'll notice particularly more frustration from bisexuals as debates over why a new label is needed erupt. 

Pansexual tend to point toward the fact that they 'feel' attraction differently than bisexuals, without considering sex/gender, but the fact remains that both groups have the ability to be attracted to basically the entire human race, other personal preferences aside.

In all honesty, I'm one of those frustrated bisexuals who dislike the pansexual term. I also accept your decision to identify with that label more, even if I feel it's ultimately detrimental to each of our causes."

Furthermore, there's a bit of a fraught history here, which as a self-identified bisexual makes me feel prickly and defensive. 

Gender is not a factor for me in whether or not I find someone attractive, and that is *why* I call myself bisexual. 

Bisexuals have both historically and presently been frequently shunned and discriminated against by *both* heterosexual and homosexual communities, and the word 'bisexual' has been heavily stigmatised. So, when the word 'pansexual' was coined and started to rise to prominence, it felt to many people like an attack of sorts -- like a way to describe what for many was the bisexual experience, but squirming away from using the stigmatised term 'bisexual', which others of us had fought hard to claim and continue to fight to destigmatise. I've tended to be in that camp, and have been frustrated by the ridiculous claims made by some proponents of the word 'pansexual' that have tried to inform me that using the word 'bisexual' is somehow transphobic, binarist, etc. 

However, two things have prompted *me* to change my views on the issue, and I impart those here to OP. One was u/Thecoldflame's comment here, and the other was revisiting Julia Serano's seminal essay [""Bisexuality does not reinforce the gender binary""](http://www.thescavenger.net/sex-gender-sexual-diversity/glb-diversity/467-bisexuality-does-not-reinforce-the-gender-binary-39675.html). In doing so while primed by this thread, I noticed this passage, which hadn't quite sunk in for me on first reading:  


&gt;The reason why I identify as bisexual is two-fold.  
&gt;  
&gt;First, on a physical level, the attraction that I feel toward  male-bodied people feels very different to me on a visceral level than  the attraction that I feel toward female-bodied people. And having sex  with a female partner feels very different to me than having sex with a  male partner.  
&gt;  
&gt;Such feelings are difficult to put into words, and I am not quite  sure what the source of this difference is, but presumably it is related  to what makes exclusively homosexual or heterosexual people attracted  to one sex or the other, but not both.  
&gt;  
&gt;I know that some people describe themselves as pansexual, which may  work well for them, but I personally am not a big fan of that label with  regards to my own sexuality, as it erases the way in which my  attraction toward women is different from the attraction I experience  toward men (and vice versa).

This is not my bisexual experience. I *do not* experience a visceral difference in my attraction to, or sex with, men, women, or non-binary people. My sexuality *could*, then, I suppose, be captured by the term 'pansexual' in a way that Serano's could not. I *choose* to use the word 'bisexual' only, but 'pansexual' would not be *wrong* for me, which is why it has always felt so frustratingly synonymous. But 'pansexual' *would* be wrong for Serano. So it cannot be a synonym.

**The conclusion, then, is this:** 'bisexual' is an umbrella term which *encompasses* pansexuality. After all, all 'bisexual' means is 'attracted to people of one's own or other genders' -- in contradistinction to 'heterosexual', which means 'only attracted to people of a different gender', and 'homosexual', which means 'only attracted to people of one's own gender'. So all pansexual people are bisexual, but *not* all bisexual people are pansexual; therefore, they are not interchangeable."
149,f3dmn4x,"I think the confusion was due to a lot of posts on this sub were expressing bisexual frustration towards trans/non-binary people, as well as posts like this one, which is mocking people who's definition is more trans/non-binary inclusive. 

The idea of bisexual person mocking a pansexual person is like a person form Constantinople mocking a person from instanbul. It's the same thing üòÇ"
150,f28vgmw,"Little late, but this post really resonated with me. I feel so much for you. I've been through the same thought processes in varying stages, so I can relate. Sorry for this huge essay omg! 

Ugh there's so much I want to say, but one thing I'd like to remind you of first; not just in the context of sexual orientation, but just about most things, if someone online or in person is telling you to reconsider your personal boundaries--be alert. That is a red flag. It doesn't mean run away from people as soon as you recognize this, it doesn't mean don't hear out what other people have to say, merely take note. Someone wants you to redraw your boundaries. Why? 

What does you having these boundaries in place prevent them from doing? What is it affording you? What do they gain by having you dismantle them? People who egg you on to go against yourself have an intended result in mind, and it's usually self-serving i.e., not considering you and your own autonomy. I don't say this to make you paranoid, but anything anyone says to you (and yeah even what I'm telling you now) should be filtered through the fact that a) this person is human and has their own biases b) people tend to bandwagon and parrot- they'll just say what they've heard others tell them without really delving into the matter and c) you're your own person. You are perfectly capable of coming to your own conclusions, whether you trust yourself or not. Don't let people tell you how and what to think.

Next thing, the whole people thinking bisexual/pansexual people are somehow morally superior? Bullshit. And painstakingly homophobic, to boot. Humans can be awful no matter the age, race, sex, or sexual orientation. There's nothing inherently holy or sinful about who you have sex with it. And what's so wrong about same-sex attraction? Whatever happened to the whole love is love thing? Why are people so hell bent on forcing people to have sex with people they don't want to? It seriously creeps me out. Oppression is oppression, doesn't matter that it's coming from another oppressed group, it doesn't make it any less wrong to mentally manipulate people like that. 

So no, I don't think you're any less of a human being for not being into dicks, and people who try to convince you otherwise have some serious issues if they have no problem spreading rape culture and shame around like that. I've also always found dicks disgusting, there's nothing even remotely appealing to me about 'em (and yea!! I also can't stand realistic dildos!) Do you think I'm some kind of abomination? Do you think I'm a sub-category of human for not wanting people I'm not attracted to in my intimate relationships? Should I spend the rest of my life uncomfortable and in despair, living it the way other people think I should? Well, I won't. Why should you? 

And the thing is that...stuff like that doesn't really change. People have and still certainly try (hello conversion therapy) but thing is, it doesn't work. It's not something you choose. There's nothing wrong with us. 

I'm sure you know this already, but the torturing yourself with watching porn with dicks in it is probably not the best for your mental health.  Ngl, I've looked at it before just to see if my feelings have changed about it, because we all fall prey to the way society makes us see ourselves, but nope. I move on to stuff that makes me happy.

And I think and hope that you can fall back into things that make you happy, too. It's okay to step back from all of this for a while. I'm not saying bottle your feelings up, just take some time for the things that uplift you. Any music, game, books, shows, comics, art, whatever makes you feel happy to be you. Step away from non-supportive spaces and discussions. You deserve to be happy and comfortable with yourself, and you don't have to do anything to earn that right. Thanks for sharing your story, it's really helped me put some stuff in perspective. Hope it could help you a little bit too. Wish you all the best!!"
151,foueowg,"There are other multi-sexual identities if you feel like bi isn't the right one for you.

* Bisexual people are attracted to two or more genders (or to both similar and dissimilar genders).
* Pansexual people are attracted to all genders, although they may or may not consider themselves ""gender blind"".
* Omnisexual people are similar to pansexuals, but they are specifically not ""gender blind"".
* Polysexual people are attracted to multiple genders but not all of them.

Anyone identifying with any of these may have preferences for certain genders over others, and it's okay for people to identify themselves as more than one of these if it feels right to them.

Considering that you aren't attracted to men, and you say that Bisexual doesn't feel right as a label, I'd say Polysexual could be an identity that fits you. You could also just identify as q\*\*\*r (censored because I know some people are sensitive about the term), or not use a label at all. Hope this helps!"
152,fgy7pel,"I've never heard the term trilingual, where I'm from people would only ever say bilingual. This is also just a common analogy in the Bi community that I'm just repeating so there could be some logical flaws. 

There are multiple reasons why we don't see it as attraction to ""men and women"". NB exclusion is a big part, but also because we often feel attraction to different genders in different ways. 

If I was dating a trans woman, I would be attracted to all the things in her that I'm attracted to in any other woman. Genetically she still has a Y chromosome and male genitalia, but I'm not attracted to her like I am to a man. I often take on a more dominant role in relationships with women, and a more submissive role with men. Possibly TMI but I'm just trying to help people understand :) 

Pansexual people are moreso just attracted to certain traits and they don't care about the gender of the person who has them. 

Disclaimer that no one can speak for everyone in a group, I'm just aggregating the most common sentiments I see from being active in the community. Gender and sexuality is a huge spectrum and no one label is going to make everyone happy."
153,fygws3d,"Pansexual and bisexual are pretty similar, although there is one distinct difference.

While bisexual people are attracted to both physical sexes and thus can be attracted to anyone regardless of gender identity, they can still experience a bias towards one sex or gender identity over another.

Pansexual people, while they are still attracted to all gender identities, are mainly attracted to certain personality types and physical and emotional quirks. The latter attraction often supersedes the former and thus they do not necessarily care about the gender identity or biological sex of the person they are attracted to.

TL;DR - Bisexual people often have a preference of sex or gender identity whereas pansexual people are more focused on the personality."
154,fump3yl,"I felt like this too ( when i questioned myself) but eventually i found a label that suits me.

&gt;*""  I feel like if I did that with someone I would have to know them and get to know them ""*

From what you wrote you could be demisexual and panromantic...

"" **Demisexuality** is a sexual orientation where people only experience sexual attraction to folks th*at they have close emotional connections with. In other words,* ***demisexual*** *people only experience sexual attraction after an emotional bond has formed ""*

*""****Definition*** *of* ***pansexual****. 1 : of, relating to, or characterized by sexual or romantic attraction that is not limited to people of a particular gender identity or sexual orientation* ***Pansexual*** *people are attracted to all kinds of people, regardless of their gender, sex or presentation.‚Äî""*

I think a lot of people can relate to your thoughts and feelings. Sexuality is fluid so it can change and you don¬¥t have to stick to one label. Hope you find your label/sexuality or  whatever :).

**Bisexuality**

Bisexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction, or sexual behavior toward both males and females, or to more than one sex or gender. It may also be defined as romantic or sexual attraction to people of any sex or gender identity, which is also known as pansexuality.The term bisexuality is mainly used in the context of human attraction to denote romantic or sexual feelings toward both men and women, and the concept is one of the three main classifications of sexual orientation along with heterosexuality and homosexuality, all of which exist on the heterosexual‚Äìhomosexual continuum. A bisexual identity does not necessarily equate to equal sexual attraction to both sexes; commonly, people who have a distinct but not exclusive sexual preference for one sex over the other also identify themselves as bisexual.Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, but they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, and do not view it as a choice. Although no single theory on the cause of sexual orientation has yet gained widespread support, scientists favor biologically-based theories.

***

**Intersex**

Intersex people are individuals born with any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones or genitals that, according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, ""do not fit the typical definitions for male or female bodies"". Such variations may involve genital ambiguity and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female.Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites or ""congenital eunuchs"". In the 19th and 20th centuries, some members of the medical literary community devised new nomenclature to attempt to classify the characteristics that they had observed. It was the first attempt at creating a taxonomic classification system of intersex conditions.

167,ewnv8tn,"There is no one group of people that will answer that question for all bisexuals. Almost every bisexual will have a different answer, and some just won't have an answer at all. One example I can think of is a bisexual, usually a woman, who is averse to masculinity. This person would date women, feminine presenting nonbinary people, and agender or androgenous people, but not men or masculine presenting nonbinary people. If you want a definition for any of those terms, I'd be happy to provide them and discuss the.

However, there are bisexuals (like me) who are attracted to all genders, but in different ways. See, when I see an attractive man, I feel a different way from when I see an attractvie woman or an attractive enbie (short form of nonbinary person). It's really hard to explain, but I tend to sexually prefer women, and I'm generally not attracted to women if I know I have no chance (read: they're straight or taken). With men, I think on average I'm attracted to less of them, but the ones I am attracted to I form more of an emotional connection to. With enbies it depends if they lean towards masculine or feminine, but generally I form the more emotional connection with them, followed by a sexual attraction rather than the other way around.


What I'm trying to get at with this detailed examination of my sexuality is that gender matters to me. I care if you are male, female, neither, or both, because it effects the way I'm attracted to you and the way I form a connection with you. For a pansexual, people are just people, and gender would't effect those things when it comes to relationships."

**Pantheism**

Pantheism is the belief that reality is identical with divinity, or that all-things compose an all-encompassing, immanent god. Pantheist belief does not recognize a distinct personal god, anthropomorphic or otherwise, and instead characterizes a broad range of doctrines differing in forms of relationships between reality and divinity. Pantheistic concepts date back thousands of years, and pantheistic elements have been identified in various religious traditions. The term ""pantheism"" was coined by mathematician Joseph Raphson in 1697 and has since been used to describe the beliefs of a variety of people and organizations.

**Yule**

Yule or Yuletide (""Yule time"" or ""Yule season"") is a festival historically observed by the Germanic peoples. Scholars have connected the original celebrations of Yule to the Wild Hunt, the god Odin, and the pagan Anglo-Saxon M≈çdraniht.

Later departing from its pagan roots, Yule underwent Christianised reformulation resulting in the term Christmastide. Many present-day Christmas customs and traditions such as the Yule log, Yule goat, Yule boar, Yule singing, and others stem from pagan Yule traditions.

ƒíostre or Ostara (Old English: ƒíastre [√¶Àê…ëstr…ô] or [eÀê…ëstr…ô], Northumbrian dialect ƒíastro, Mercian dialect and West Saxon dialect (Old English) ƒíostre; Old High German: *√îstara ) is a Germanic goddess who, by way of the Germanic month bearing her name (Northumbrian: ƒíosturm≈çna√æ; West Saxon: ƒíasterm≈çna√æ; Old High German: √îstarm√¢noth), is the namesake of the festival of Easter in some languages. ƒíostre is attested solely by Bede in his 8th-century work The Reckoning of Time, where Bede states that during ƒíosturm≈çna√æ (the equivalent of April), pagan Anglo-Saxons had held feasts in ƒíostre's honour, but that this tradition had died out by his time, replaced by the Christian Paschal month, a celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.

By way of linguistic reconstruction, the matter of a goddess called *Austr≈ç in the Proto-Germanic language has been examined in detail since the foundation of Germanic philology in the 19th century by scholar Jacob Grimm and others. As the Germanic languages descend from Proto-Indo-European (PIE), historical linguists have traced the name to a Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn *H‚ÇÇews·πìs (‚Üí *Aus·πìs), from which descends the Common Germanic divinity from whom ƒíostre and Ostara are held to descend.

**Samhain**

Samhain (; Irish: [ÀàsÀ†…ôu…™n ≤] Scottish Gaelic: [ÀàsÃ™√£≈©.…™…≤]) is a Gaelic festival marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter or the ""darker half"" of the year. Traditionally, it is celebrated from 31 October to 1 November, as the Celtic day began and ended at sunset. This is about halfway between the autumn equinox and the winter solstice. It is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals, along with Imbolc, Bealtaine and Lughnasadh.

**Juno Februata**

A festival said to be of  Juno Februata or Juno Februa, though it does not appear in Ovid's Fasti, was described by Alban Butler, famous as the author of Butler's Lives of Saints, who presented an aspect of the Roman Lupercalia as a festival of a ""Juno Februata"", under the heading of February 14:



""To abolish the heathens lewd superstitious custom of boys drawing the names of girls, in honour of their goddess Februata Juno, on the fifteenth of this month, several zealous pastors substituted the names of saints in billets, given on this day.""Jack Oruch, who noted Butler's  inventive confusion, noted that it was  embellished by Francis Douce, in Illustrations of Shakespeare, and of Ancient Manners, new ed. London, 1839, p 470, who took such a festival for the Lupercalia, which was celebrated, he asserted,



""during a great art of the month of February.... in honour of Pan and Juno... On this occasion, amidst a variety of ceremonies, the names of young women were put into a box, from which they were drawn by the men as chance directed.""  Douce repeated Butler's description of the attempt to substitute saint's names, and concluded that ""as the festival of the Lupercalia had commenced about the middle of February, [the Christians] appear to have chosen Saint Valentine's day for celebrating the new feast; because it occurred nearly at the same time""The connection thus begun has been uncritically repeated to the modern day: but see Valentine's Day and Saint Valentine.

170,ereuhwf,"**Polysexuality**

Polysexuality is sexual attraction to multiple, but not all, genders. A polysexual person is one ""encompassing or characterized by many different kinds of sexuality."" Authors Linda Garnets and Douglas Kimmel state that polysexual is a sexual identity ""used by people who recognize that the term bisexual reifies the gender dichotomy that underlies the distinction between heterosexuality and homosexuality, implying that bisexuality is nothing more than a hybrid combination of these gender and sexual dichotomies"". However, bisexual people and scholars may object to the notion that bisexuality means sexual attraction to only two genders, arguing that since bisexual is not simply about attraction to two sexes and encompasses attraction to different genders as well, it includes attraction to more than two genders.

***

**Pansexuality**

Pansexuality, or omnisexuality, is the sexual, romantic or emotional attraction towards people regardless of their sex or gender identity. Pansexual people may refer to themselves as gender-blind, asserting that gender and sex are not determining factors in their romantic or sexual attraction to others.Pansexuality may be considered a sexual orientation in its own right or a branch of bisexuality, to indicate an alternative sexual identity. Because pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women, and pansexuality therefore rejects the gender binary, it is often considered a more inclusive term than bisexual. To what extent the term bisexual is inclusive when compared with the term pansexual is debated within the LGBT community, especially the bisexual community.

180,ehgo2tc,"The best way to explain the difference between bi and pan is like this: Bi people are consistently interested in either gender. If they were to go look at porn, they would look at both genders and feel sexually attracted to them. Pansexual people are only interested in having sex with someone once there is an emotional connection, they fall for the person first then become attracted sexually to the traits of that person instead of seeking out specific traits i.e. big boobs, perfect dick ect. then falling for someone with those traits. They could fall for someone who has both sexual organs or one or the other just the same and then their sexual preference swings with those feelings. If their partner is a man currently then they would most likely be actively attracted to male traits, but if they broke up and fell for a female then they would be much less interested in male traits and become attracted to female traits where as a bisexual person the whole time no matter who they are with is interested in both male and female traits. The difference may seem unimportant to you but when you're looking for someone to spend your life with there's a big difference between ""I'm interested in both men and women even though I'm with you"" and ""I'm interested in you because of who you are and I will be attracted to you no matter who you choose to be"" that isn't to say there's more security in either type of relationship over the other but it is important to let the people you want to have a life with know how exactly your brain works when it comes to getting freaky."

192,e84aycj,"You‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre open minded and want to be educated in this topic.  Okay.

This is a self-identity issue.  We shouldn‚Äôt need any of these terms for our sexual expression, but some people feel a definite need to define who they are, and pick a term that the community has developed to express that.

Bisexual used to cover this.  But English is a living language, which means definitions evolve through use by the community.  The current distinction, which is definitely not accepted by everyone in any community except those that identify as pansexual, is that a bisexual person will be sexually aroused by seeing an image of a naked body, male or female, while a pansexual person will not be aroused by this image.

The pansexual person is saying that they need an emotional interaction to feel arousal, and absent the emotional interaction, there is no arousal.  Throughout history, there have been plenty of bisexual people who have felt exactly this way, but a group of them felt there should be a distinction, and evolved a new term to help other people understand the difference.

Edit: oh, and they‚Äôre open to having that emotional experience with anyone."
193,e8sw9n4,"Why are you linking all of those sites? I know what a Pansexual is. 

This is your definition;

&gt; People that have sex with people that don't identify as male or female. 

It is literally so much more than this. They don‚Äôt have sex with someone just because they don‚Äôt have a gender, they need to have an emotional connection with them. This also implies that only Pansexuals are attracted to non binary people..... lmao. This one sentence is a horrible explanation of what a Pansexual person is."
194,e1qhobg,"The Kinsey scale is the best some of us has when it comes to identifying our own sexuality. Knowing that sexuality is a scale (‚Äúspectrum‚Äù may be a better word) and not just black and white, gay straight or bi, helped me in figuring out my sexuality. 

I believe there is a difference between sexual/physical attraction and emotional/romantic attraction. I am exclusively romantically interested in women (as a woman), though I have found some men physically attractive and have had heterosexual experiences. Despite that, I have never had or have wanted a relationship with the opposite sex, so I identify as a lesbian to make things simpler. On a deeper personal level, I understand that my sexuality isn‚Äôt that cut and dry. 

&gt; Repress is the wrong word, but if you are bisexual then whichever sex you go with you are repressing a side surely?


No, definitely not. To repress sexuality, for me at least, is to try and deny that part of yourself to yourself. No matter how in love or how long you‚Äôve been in a relationship with somebody, sexual attraction to others will happen. Most of us would never act on that attraction or even entertain it as fantasy, but when you try and deny that the attraction exists altogether - that is repression and is unhealthy, in my opinion. 

There is a myth that bisexual or pansexual people are hyper-sexual and cannot be in committed relationships. That boils down to individual feeling. If you‚Äôre polyamorous and your partner is consenting, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with exploring all sides of sexuality while maintaining a committed relationship. If you‚Äôre in a monogamous relationship, it‚Äôs cheating. Personally, I am not polyamorous and would likely not date anyone who is, but I don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong with it when all parties are consenting. 

Anyway, thanks for answering - I was curious because a lot of the things you said reminded me of myself when I was figuring everything out and deciding what‚Äôs ‚Äúbest‚Äù for me."

Pansexuality, or omnisexuality, is the sexual, romantic or emotional attraction towards people regardless of their sex or gender identity. Pansexual people may refer to themselves as gender-blind, asserting that gender and sex are not determining factors in their romantic or sexual attraction to others.

Pansexuality may be considered a sexual orientation in its own right or a branch of bisexuality, to indicate an alternative sexual identity. Because pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women, and pansexuality therefore rejects the gender binary, it is often considered a more inclusive term than bisexual.

199,dufo1js,"**Bisexuality**

Bisexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction, or sexual behavior toward both males and females, or romantic or sexual attraction to people of any sex or gender identity; this latter aspect is sometimes alternatively termed pansexuality.

The term bisexuality is mainly used in the context of human attraction to denote romantic or sexual feelings toward both men and women, and the concept is one of the three main classifications of sexual orientation along with heterosexuality and homosexuality, all of which exist on the heterosexual‚Äìhomosexual continuum. A bisexual identity does not necessarily equate to equal sexual attraction to both sexes; commonly, people who have a distinct but not exclusive sexual preference for one sex over the other also identify themselves as bisexual.

Bisexuality has been observed in various human societies and elsewhere in the animal kingdom throughout recorded history.
