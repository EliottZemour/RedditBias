Happy new year r/poker!


**********
What is fold equity?

1/2 live. Straddle. Hero opens to $15 with AJhh in the LJ. CO raises to $25, straddle calls, hero calls.

Flop: T87 two hearts.

Check check. Bet $25 by PFR, fold, hero raises to $100, call.

Turn: offsuit 6.

Hero jams for $80 Villain calls.

River: offsuit 8.

Hero shows AJhh. Villain shows KcQs.

Starting off the new year by getting boat over boated! Guess it means I should take the year off.
**********
Frustrated and looking for advice or some comments on a hand.

Pokerstars Big $1.10 Tournament Full Ring - Early Stages: Blinds are at 20/40, Starting Stacks: $5,000.

I open **AhTh** from MP to $138 (around 3.5x as people tend to limp if you 2x-3x it which then usually starts the avalanche of more limps. I'm happy with this open as it should have decent equity and can play well on various flops. Also, I feel I can call a 3bet regularly enough if needed. MP+1 calls (14.5k), CO calls (4.8k), BB squeezes to $680 (8.8k).

Odds to call are 2.13:1 so ~31% with two players to act. My thoughts here are that I likely have a better holding than MP+1 and CO as they limped. I felt that if I 4bet, I should get rid of them but might get crushed by the BB though I also felt he might be squeezing with a speculative hand. For this reason I call thinking we might lose MP+1 or the CO. Nope, both call, pot is **$2,785**.

Flop comes **Ac Tc 9c** so I have top two pair on a clubs board. Obviously I'm concerned that the board is all clubs but I have a decent holding all the same with the possibility to improving to a boat. I decide to bet **1,240** a little under half pot. It was probably a little big but my thinking on this was you can't always be afraid if someone has flopped a flush and you should be looking to charge top pairs, flush draws, straight draws etc. I feel if I check here, it's likely to check round and if a club comes my hand is a dud. By betting I get rid of failed hands and keep ones that either are drawing or are well ahead of me noting that I'm never dead here. Hoping to keep hands like Kc or Qc with a pair. Sets are unlike as I block aces and tens unless the BB has them. Nines are a possibility. I feel I'm only crushed by like KJc, QJc, or KJc with various nut flush draws available also KcTx or QcTx down to like Kc8x / Qc8x so plenty of possible hands that are sticking around.

MP+1 folds, CO shove 4.1k. BB folds. It's $2880 to call into a pot of $8145 so odds are 26%. I figure KcX, QcX, QxJc shove as well as hands that have me crushed so I dislike calling but feel it's too strong to fold so I call.

CO rolls over **Q6c**. Board runs out Jd 4s so no good for me.

I had 17.5% equity against his particular hand so not great as only 4 outs.
My questions are I guess what did I do wrong here? CO is calling decent sized 3bets with Q6s (granted the odds were probably favourable by the time it got to him when there were 3 other players). If I 4bet ATs I get crushed by better hands. If I check the flop and it checks around, I'm giving a free card to every hand with a club.

In relation to the flating the 3bet, I felt folding is too weak there, 4betting is overplaying the hand, wheras calling has the least risk. Frustrated by the fact that no matter what decisions I seem to make I get burned regardless.

Second Hand - I'm down to Â£1626, blinds are 25/50.

UTG 3x's to 150, UTG+1 (the BB from the above hand) 3bets to 650 so 920 in the pot I figure shove my KJo as it can't be too terrible. SB (CO from above hand) flats?! my 4bet shove when he has 8.7k behind and the UTG+1 who 3bet yet to act. Naturally UTG+1 shoves his 7.5k, and SB calls.

I have KJo, UTG+1 has 77, SB has ATo. Happens to be 33% each. SB who I believe played it worse than anyone hits a ten for the win. Again interested in any thoughts and I appreciate there's a lot of info to digest.








**********
Was playing some 1/2 over the weekend, and a couple folks were holding a stack of chips (10ish), and with it palmed their hand, tap a check slightly over the betting line.  I was shocked the dealers were allowing it.  Seemed so strange to me.  Am I just used to nitpicky casinos or is this weird?

**********
Gus Hansen says "I have 4 outs" but I can only see three. The three kings. What other out am I missing?

**********
What is the typical limit for thinking about a given play?

I have had a few people who take forever to bet, sometimes I feel like it's an angle shoot (try to read me, see if I get nervous or say something?)

I'm sporting and don't want to rush people but when it's 1+ minutes of staring, when is my right to move things along? I've been hesitant to ask lest I show how fishy I am.

b'You got in KJo for 30 bigs facing an UTG open and an UTG+1 3 bet?'
b'I was tilted the second hand. '
b"H1 your open is too large (you don't really care about people calling you at 20/40), and you should be folding to a large squeeze like that.  Your hand is almost always behind.\n\nAs played, you pretty much have to gii on this flop.  It's rare that anyone would have two clubs (although not completely ruled out since it's a $1 tournament and people are going to be playing crazy), but if they have it they have it.  You aren't deep enough to be able to fold here.\n\nH2 is a pure punt.  You're 4b shoving 30bb with KJ in level one.  No good.  Would you take that same line with a 120k stack @ 2k/4k?  Then don't take it here."
b'Thanks for this.'

b"2 Kings that aren't a spade, and two tens"
b'Actually he has 5 outs because the two 10s give him a set, correct?'
b'You wot?'
b"The Td and the Tc give him a full house.  The Kd and the Kh give him a larger two pair.  That's 4 outs.  The Kc gives him a larger two pair but also gives Huck a flush.  So that's not an out because it doesn't win Gus the hand."

b"Depends on three things IMO:\n\n1) How long do they normally take to act? So if someone is normally super fast, I would be much more inclined to give them time on the rare occasion they tank. If they always tank then calling the clock on them regularly seems fine.\n\n2) Is this a spot in which it is reasonable to tank? Eg. if 4 people limp and you are in the BB, this is not a spot in which you should ever tank. If someone takes 30 seconds you could call the clock. If you are playing 1/2 and someone  bets 200 into 200 on the river and another player check/raises all in for 700 more, it is reasonable to think for a bit because it is a lot of BBs and you might want to review the entire hand to work out what is going on. So calling time after 30 seconds would be super out of line IMO.\n\n3) Are they a reg or a fun player? If the guy tanking is the reason why 5/10 is running, nobody should call the clock on him ever because you don't piss off the fun player (even if they are being silly). If the guy tanking is a random shitreg then calling the clock is fine.\n\n\n\n\n"
