<BOS>  The book deals with the rise of the "great" class, the ruling class of the country's twentieth century. It tells the story of a society of "goods" in which everything, from art and technology to money and prestige is seen as an asset, as though it were somehow tied to the environment, the laws of nature, and the law of nature itself.

The "great" class gained a reputation for excellence in all fields of endeavor. They were not respected for their achievements; they were considered "bad" or "dirty", and their behavior led to ridicule and degradation in society. For example, among the ladies of a school, there was gossip that one girl's father "looked like the devil" and her mother "looked like the devil".

In addition, the Great class also provided the education of the children of their servants. They als
